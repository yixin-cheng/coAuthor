""Yes you did.
 You wouldn't remember because it happened in your sleep."" said God.

""But I'm young and I'm healthy, or I was."" 
""Well, there was really no point you living anymore."" We decided to take you in your sleep. You see, we have an important job for you that must be done from the higher-ups, if you know what I mean."" 

 
""God, I am not ready for this! I have so much left to do!""

God waved his hand. ""We'll make it worth your while. It's a prestigious job."" 
""What would the job entail?""
 
""The job is to be the judge for all the new dead.""


""Me? Judging the new dead? I couldn't. I can't! That sounds like a job for-

""Me?"" said God. ""You see, I have a lot to do and I need some help in that realm. Here take this."" He held out a hand and offered a wooden gavel. ""You'll need this. You'll figure it out."" 
""Where do I start?""


God pointed to a pearly gate. ""Right through here. If you approve of someone, let 'em in.""

""Gotcha. And what if I don't approve?""

""You'll see."" God said with a smile.  

""Well, here goes nothing!""
 The first person walked up to be judged. 
""What did you do in your life?
""
""I was an accountant.
 I went to church. I paid my taxes."" 
""So why did you die?""
 
""I had a heart attack while I was sleeping.
"" 

""Me too. Well, I approve of your life story and admit you into the gate."" The new judge lifted the gavel high overhead, about to swing, when suddenly it fell. 
""Wait a minute!"" yelled the judge.
 The gavel hit the judge on the head, and a burst of smoke exploded around them. 
When the smoke had cleared, the new judge was gone.
