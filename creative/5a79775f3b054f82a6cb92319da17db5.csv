Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the ""Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. It is found that taking the drug reduces the ability to feel happiness by about one per cent a year. 

In other words, over the course of a century, you will reach a maximum state of happiness equivalent to that of the most miserable person on earth. Needless to say, you are depressed. But they say ""never waste a crisis,"" so suicide centers spring up across the globe, where for a few thousand dollars you can end your misery forever.

You go to a suicide clinic and sign up for the ""suicide tour"" - a 90-day, round-the-world trip with other suicidal, sad drug recipients. But the trip just adds to your misery: the crowds, airport lines, petty criminals, and cramped hotel rooms seem the saddest things you have ever experienced. On your hotel TV, here is even a parody of the film ""The Wizard of Oz"" called ""The Wizard of Sads"". Your tour guide is a man who seems to have a terminal case of the ""Sads"", who finds new and creative ways to add to your unhappiness. He constantly asks you about what you like to do, but the memories he evokes just serve to make you more miserable, as you realize that you will never feel that happy again. 

Finally,  thesadistic tour guide comes to your room. He has an offer for you. He hold a green pill in his hand.

""Take this, "" he says, ""and your troubles will be over.""
""What is it?"" you ask, trembling.


""It makes you forget you were ever happy,"" says the man.

You take the pill and swallow.
You wake up the next morning, and you feel fine.
