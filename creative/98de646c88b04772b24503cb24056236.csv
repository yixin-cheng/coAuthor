So, they marshal all the world's resources for the rescue effort. All the world's armies mobilize. They gather the best, most hardened warriors from the most elite divisions of each army. They outfit them with the best weaponry, technology and support staff. They put these hardened warriors in the most advanced, fully loaded war machines. They use the most advanced scanners to track Matt Damon's precise position on the ship, and prepare to launch the newly formed 'Space Force' to get him back.

Meanwhile, the alien captor tries to interrogate Matt Damon. He tries to get him to reveal some juicy Hollywood gossip or something. As it turns out, this alien is a huge fan of the Jason Bourne movies in particular, and Hollywood  in general,  and he's eager to find out what Matt Damon or any of his actor friends have been up to lately. The interrogation doesn't go well. Matt Damon remains steadfastly silent. The alien is left with no choice but to put him back in his cell.

Back on Earth, the Space Force is ready. They launch the rescue mission, and intercept the alien ship quickly. It's automated defenses are no match for the advanced weaponry of Earth's Space Force. In a matter of moments, the ship's hull has been breached and the craft has been boarded. The troops move in for the rescue. The alien scrambles, and moves Matt Damon to the most secure area of the ship, but the impregnated doors soon fall to Space Force beam weaponry.

The Space Force enters the area, and finds the alien holding Matt Damon at gunpoint.

So, they marshal all the world's resources for the rescue effort. All the world's armies mobilize. They gather the best, most hardened warriors from the most elite divisions of each army.

They use the most advanced scanners to track Matt Damon's precise position on the ship, and prepare to launch the newly formed 'Space Force' to get him back.

Meanwhile, the alien captor tries to interrogate Matt Damon. He tries to get him to reveal some juicy Hollywood gossip or something.

They aim their own weapons, and try to explain to the alien that Matt Damon is the real-life person whose life we pretend to live, and that if he isn't freed, humanity will vanish like a forgotten dream. But, the alien is easily panicked, and doesn't understand what they're saying, and mistakenly shoots Matt Damon, killing him instantly.
