When she first discovered that she was suddenly stronger than everyone around her, even the horrible aliens, she nearly gave herself away many times. To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.
This has made Lia one of the most trusted people in the resistance.
 It has taken years for the resistance to finally gain the strenght they need to defeat the aliens, but they are working quietly, gathering forces and weapons to make one sweeping stand against the three main alien stongholds dotted around the world. Lia has trained her soldiers well, and they feel ready to finally wipe out the aliens once and for all.

The leader of the humans with recently reawakened powers is Lia. As the oldest, and the first to discover her powers, she decided to help others like her.

To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.

The leader of the humans with recently reawakened Mana powers is Lia. As the oldest, and the first to discover her powers, she decided to help others like her. When she first discovered that she was suddenly stronger than everyone around her, even the horrible aliens, she nearly gave herself away many times. To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior, who might also be Mana weilders. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.
This has made Lia one of the most trusted people in the resistance.
 It has taken years for the resistance to finally gain the strenght they need to defeat the aliens, but they are working quietly, gathering forces and weapons to make one sweeping stand against the three main alien stongholds dotted around the world. Lia has trained her soldiers well, and they feel ready to finally wipe out the aliens once and for all.
But before they strike, Lia receives a request for help from an unexpected source.
 There is a small group of secretive power-wielders, who have always been wary of Lia and her resistance group. They never believed that the aliens could be defeted, so they holde up on their own, at an outpost far north of Lia. She gambles on making the trek to them to beg for their help, because she knows her resistance fighters may not win without the help of these other, extremely powerful Mana wielders.

Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.
This has made Lia one of the most trusted people in the resistance.
 It has taken years for the resistance to finally gain the strenght they need to defeat the aliens, but they are working quietly, gathering forces and weapons to make one sweeping stand against the three main alien stongholds dotted around the world. Lia has trained her soldiers well, and they feel ready to finally wipe out the aliens once and for all.
But before they strike, Lia receives a request for help from an unexpected source.

They never believed that the aliens could be defeted, so they holde up on their own, at an outpost far north of Lia. She gambles on making the trek to them to beg for their help, because she knows her resistance fighters may not win without the help of these other, extremely powerful Mana wielders.

To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior, who might also be Mana weilders. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.
This has made Lia one of the most trusted people in the resistance.
 It has taken years for the resistance to finally gain the strenght they need to defeat the aliens, but they are working quietly, gathering forces and weapons to make one sweeping stand against the three main alien stongholds dotted around the world.

But before they strike, Lia receives a request for help from an unexpected source.

The leader of the humans with recently reawakened Mana powers is Lia. As the oldest, and the first to discover her powers, she decided to help others like her. When she first discovered that she was suddenly stronger than everyone around her, even the horrible aliens, she nearly gave herself away many times. To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior, who might also be Mana weilders. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.

Lia has trained her soldiers well, and they feel ready to finally wipe out the aliens once and for all.

Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.

To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior, who might also be Mana weilders. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.
This has made Lia one of the most trusted people in the resistance.
 It has taken years for the resistance to finally gain the strenght they need to defeat the aliens, but they are working quietly, gathering forces and weapons to make one sweeping stand against the three main alien stongholds dotted around the world.

But before they strike, Lia receives a request for help from an unexpected source.
 There is a small group of secretive power-wielders, who have always been wary of Lia and her resistance group. They never believed that the aliens could be defeted, so they holde up on their own, at an outpost far north of Lia. She gambles on making the trek to them to beg for their help, because she knows her resistance fighters may not win without the help of these other, extremely powerful Mana wielders.

To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior, who might also be Mana weilders. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.

 It has taken years for the resistance to finally gain the strenght they need to defeat the aliens, but they are working quietly, gathering forces and weapons to make one sweeping stand against the three main alien stongholds dotted around the world.

The leader of the humans with recently reawakened Mana powers is Lia. As the oldest, and the first to discover her powers, she decided to help others like her. When she first discovered that she was suddenly stronger than everyone around her, even the horrible aliens, she nearly gave herself away many times. To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior, who might also be Mana weilders. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.
