Men have always been very competitive and this new ranking has them very motivated. Men begin to get more involved than ever.

Women feel resentful for the years they have worked without the involvement of dads. They realize dads could have been doing better all along if they had cared. It turned out it is not a love of a woman that makes a dad care or even the love of a child. What makes a man care is his competitive nature. He wants to win...he wants the top spot. Women are they glad they at least now truly understand men's motivations.
Dads now have an opportunity to become more involved than ever and prove that they love their family.
 They really need to work had to regain the respect of women too. They will need to work even harder because they have a lot of making up to do. No one saw this ranking system coming but it really turned out to be a good thing. Men are doing more and loving it. They see how rewarding it is to be involved with children. 

More men become teachers and nurses and nannies. There is a lot more equality and gender roles become more diverse. If only someone had started this ranking long ago! The world would be a much better place. But not with dads being more accountable it is well on its way. 
The children and women are really happy.
