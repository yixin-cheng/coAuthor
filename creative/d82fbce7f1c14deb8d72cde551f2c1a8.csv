I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates.

Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone.

Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up.

What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone.

Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up.

What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?""

I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up.

I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone.

What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing. I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going.

He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing. I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going.

I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas. What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing. I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas. What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing. I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas. What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing. I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas. What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing. I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas. What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing.

I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing. I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going. 

nce I arrived, the coordinates pointed me to an abandoned warehouse.
 I took a step inside and there was a man in the shadows sitting at a desk. All he said was ""Welcome Bara",2028,[],0,0,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,2119

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas. What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone.

I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing. I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going.

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas. What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas. What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing. I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going.

What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing. I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going.

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas.

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today.

He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up.

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas. What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up.

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas. What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing.

Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing. I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going. 

nce I arrived, the coordinates pointed me to an abandoned warehouse.

I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up. 

At this point, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I packed a small bag and told my security that I would not be needing their services today. I saw the location was only a 45 minute drive away so I grabbed one of the cars and set out. The entire time I was driving, my mind was just racing. I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going.

I questioned what I was doing, I thought about who could be there, I wondered if I was being kidnapped but at the end of it all I just kept going. 

nce I arrived, the coordinates pointed me to an abandoned warehouse.
 I took a step inside and there was a man in the shadows sitting at a desk. All he said was ""Welcome Barack"". I finally got close enough to see his face and to my complete and utter shock, it really was JFK in the flesh. Al",2146,[],0,0,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,2320

At first I thought someone was playing a prank on me. The more and more I thought about it the more I would get lost in the rabbit hole. Is it the JFK? It can't be. Everyone saw him die in Dallas. What could this real job be? I was already President of the United States, which is arguably the hardest and most stressful job on the planet. Then I thought, ""How did this letter get here?"" Did Michelle grab it from the mail? Did someone sneak into my house and leave it here? Am I being watched? How did they get passed my Secret Service agents? 

Finally, I decided to take a chance and call the number. I called it from a burner phone and a man answered. He didn't say who he was but asked if I had the letter that was left on my bedside table. I told him that I did. He told me to look at the back and that is when I noticed in a very small print there was a set of coordinates. He told me to put those into my phone and that a black van would be waiting for me, but there was one catch: I had to go alone. I tried to ask him what the job was or who he was working for but before I could get my question out, the man hung up.
