 She is constantly looking up at the stars. She is very curious about the world around her.  She questions everything. She is always asking questions. Some people don't like that. They think she is strange or rude. They tell her to stop asking questions. She doesn't care what they think. She just keeps asking questions. Every time she asks a question in the film that annoys someone, an audience member lets out a laugh. I laugh along with them. I can't help it. I am so happy that I am not like the other kids.

The reason I choose a private box seat is because I want to be able to see everything that is going on.
 I want to be able to see the people, the places, and the things that I will be doing in my next life. I am very excited to see how this goes.  The lights start to dim as the film begins to play. I am sitting on the edge of my seat. The film is about a little girl who is about to be born. She is a very special little girl. It will take her many years to realize just how special she is. 
As the film continues, I start to notice that the little girl is very different from the other children.
 She is constantly looking up at the stars. She is very curious about the world around her.  She questions everything. She is always asking questions. Some people don't like that. They think she is strange or rude. They tell her to stop asking questions. She doesn't care what they think. She just keeps asking questions. Every time she asks a question in the film that annoys someone, an audience member lets out a laugh. I laugh along with them. I can't help it. I am so happy that I am not like the other kids. 

The lights come on. It's time for intermission. I walk out of the theater and go to the concession stand. Everyone is being served popcorn. I ask for some popcorn as well. Another audience member asks me how I'm enjoying the film so far. ""It's a great story so far! I can't wait to see how it ends.""

 I want to be able to see the people, the places, and the things that I will be doing in my next life. I am very excited to see how this goes.  The lights start to dim as the film begins to play. I am sitting on the edge of my seat. The film is about a little girl who is about to be born. She is a very special little girl. It will take her many years to realize just how special she is. 
As the film continues, I start to notice that the little girl is very different from the other children.
 She is constantly looking up at the stars. She is very curious about the world around her.  She questions everything. She is always asking questions. Some people don't like that. They think she is strange or rude. They tell her to stop asking questions. She doesn't care what they think. She just keeps asking questions. Every time she asks a question in the film that annoys someone, an audience member lets out a laugh. I laugh along with them. I can't help it. I am so happy that I am not like the other kids. 

The lights come on. It's time for intermission. I walk out of the theater and go to the concession stand. Everyone is being served popcorn. I ask for some popcorn as well. Another audience member asks me how I'm enjoying the film so far. ""It's a great story so far! I can't wait to see how it ends."" 
The lights dim again and the film resumes.

The reason I choose a private box seat is because I want to be able to see everything that is going on.
 I want to be able to see the people, the places, and the things that I will be doing in my next life. I am very excited to see how this goes.  The lights start to dim as the film begins to play. I am sitting on the edge of my seat. The film is about a little girl who is about to be born. She is a very special little girl. It will take her many years to realize just how special she is. 
As the film continues, I start to notice that the little girl is very different from the other children.
 She is constantly looking up at the stars. She is very curious about the world around her.  She questions everything. She is always asking questions. Some people don't like that. They think she is strange or rude. They tell her to stop asking questions. She doesn't care what they think. She just keeps asking questions. Every time she asks a question in the film that annoys someone, an audience member lets out a laugh. I laugh along with them. I can't help it. I am so happy that I am not like the other kids. 

The lights come on. It's time for intermission. I walk out of the theater and go to the concession stand. Everyone is being served popcorn. I ask for some popcorn as well. Another audience member asks me how I'm enjoying the film so far. ""It's a great story so far! I can't wait to see how it ends."" 
The lights dim again and the film resumes.
 The little girl is now a teenager. Then she is a young adult. By the time I'd finished half of my popcorn, she was an elderly woman in her 70s. She is still curious and still asking questions. One day, she",1978,[],0,3,5,30,0.3,1,0,0,1125

I am sitting on the edge of my seat. The film is about a little girl who is about to be born. She is a very special little girl. It will take her many years to realize just how special she is. 
As the film continues, I start to notice that the little girl is very different from the other children.
 She is constantly looking up at the stars. She is very curious about the world around her.  She questions everything. She is always asking questions. Some people don't like that. They think she is strange or rude. They tell her to stop asking questions. She doesn't care what they think. She just keeps asking questions. Every time she asks a question in the film that annoys someone, an audience member lets out a laugh. I laugh along with them. I can't help it. I am so happy that I am not like the other kids. 

The lights come on. It's time for intermission. I walk out of the theater and go to the concession stand. Everyone is being served popcorn. I ask for some popcorn as well. Another audience member asks me how I'm enjoying the film so far. ""It's a great story so far! I can't wait to see how it ends.""

As the film continues, I start to notice that the little girl is very different from the other children.
 She is constantly looking up at the stars. She is very curious about the world around her.  She questions everything. She is always asking questions. Some people don't like that. They think she is strange or rude. They tell her to stop asking questions. She doesn't care what they think. She just keeps asking questions. Every time she asks a question in the film that annoys someone, an audience member lets out a laugh. I laugh along with them. I can't help it. I am so happy that I am not like the other kids. 

The lights come on. It's time for intermission. I walk out of the theater and go to the concession stand. Everyone is being served popcorn. I ask for some popcorn as well. Another audience member asks me how I'm enjoying the film so far. ""It's a great story so far! I can't wait to see how it ends."" 
The lights dim again and the film resumes.

 She is constantly looking up at the stars. She is very curious about the world around her.  She questions everything. She is always asking questions. Some people don't like that. They think she is strange or rude. They tell her to stop asking questions. She doesn't care what they think. She just keeps asking questions.

As the film continues, I start to notice that the little girl is very different from the other children.
 She is constantly looking up at the stars. She is very curious about the world around her.  She questions everything. She is always asking questions. Some people don't like that. They think she is strange or rude. They tell her to stop asking questions. She doesn't care what they think. She just keeps asking questions. Every time she asks a question in the film that annoys someone, an audience member lets out a laugh. I laugh along with them. I can't help it. I am so happy that I am not like the other kids.

I choose a private box seat. 
The reason I choose a private box seat is because I want to be able to see everything that is going on.

As the film continues, I start to notice that the little girl is very different from the other children.
 She is constantly looking up at the stars. She is very curious about the world around her.  She questions everything. She is always asking questions. Some people don't like that. They think she is strange or rude. They tell her to stop asking questions. She doesn't care what they think. She just keeps asking questions. Every time she asks a question in the film that annoys someone, an audience member lets out a laugh. I laugh along with them. I can't help it. I am so happy that I am not like the other kids.

 I want to be able to see the people, the places, and the things that I will be doing in my next life. I am very excited to see how this goes.  The lights start to dim as the film begins to play. I am sitting on the edge of my seat. The film is about a little girl who is about to be born. She is a very special little girl. It will take her many years to realize just how special she is. 
As the film continues, I start to notice that the little girl is very different from the other children.
 She is constantly looking up at the stars. She is very curious about the world around her.  She questions everything. She is always asking questions. Some people don't like that. They think she is strange or rude. They tell her to stop asking questions. She doesn't care what they think. She just keeps asking questions. Every time she asks a question in the film that annoys someone, an audience member lets out a laugh. I laugh along with them. I can't help it. I am so happy that I am not like the other kids. 

The lights come on. It's time for intermission. I walk out of the theater and go to the concession stand. Everyone is being served popcorn. I ask for some popcorn as well. Another audience member asks me how I'm enjoying the film so far. ""It's a great story so far! I can't wait to see how it ends."" 
The lights dim again and the film resumes.
 The little girl is now a teenager. Then she is a young adult. By the time I'd finished half of my popcorn, she was an elderly woman in her 70s. She is still curious and still asking questions. One day, she thinks of the most brilliant question. She asks, ""What is the meaning of life?"" She writes down the question in her book.

As the film continues, I start to notice that the little girl is very different from the other children.
 She is constantly looking up at the stars. She is very curious about the world around her.  She questions everything. She is always asking questions. Some people don't like that. They think she is strange or rude. They tell her to stop asking questions. She doesn't care what they think. She just keeps asking questions. Every time she asks a question in the film that annoys someone, an audience member lets out a laugh. I laugh along with them. I can't help it. I am so happy that I am not like the other kids. 

The lights come on. It's time for intermission. I walk out of the theater and go to the concession stand. Everyone is being served popcorn. I ask for some popcorn as well. Another audience member asks me how I'm enjoying the film so far. ""It's a great story so far! I can't wait to see how it ends."" 
The lights dim again and the film resumes.
 The little girl is now a teenager. Then she is a young adult. By the time I'd finished half of my popcorn, she was an elderly woman in her 70s. She is still curious and still asking questions. One day, she thinks of the most brilliant question. She asks, ""What is the meaning of life?"" She writes down the question in her book.

I am sitting on the edge of my seat. The film is about a little girl who is about to be born. She is a very special little girl. It will take her many years to realize just how special she is. 
As the film continues, I start to notice that the little girl is very different from the other children.
 She is constantly looking up at the stars. She is very curious about the world around her.  She questions everything. She is always asking questions. Some people don't like that. They think she is strange or rude. They tell her to stop asking questions. She doesn't care what they think. She just keeps asking questions. Every time she asks a question in the film that annoys someone, an audience member lets out a laugh. I laugh along with them. I can't help it. I am so happy that I am not like the other kids. 

The lights come on. It's time for intermission. I walk out of the theater and go to the concession stand. Everyone is being served popcorn. I ask for some popcorn as well. Another audience member asks me how I'm enjoying the film so far. ""It's a great story so far! I can't wait to see how it ends."" 
The lights dim again and the film resumes.
 The little girl is now a teenager. Then she is a young adult. By the time I'd finished half of my popcorn, she was an elderly woman in her 70s. She is still curious and still asking questions. One day, she thinks of the most brilliant question. She asks, ""What is the meaning of life?"" She writes down the question in her book.

The reason I choose a private box seat is because I want to be able to see everything that is going on.
 I want to be able to see the people, the places, and the things that I will be doing in my next life. I am very excited to see how this goes.  The lights start to dim as the film begins to play. I am sitting on the edge of my seat. The film is about a little girl who is about to be born. She is a very special little girl. It will take her many years to realize just how special she is. 
As the film continues, I start to notice that the little girl is very different from the other children.
 She is constantly looking up at the stars. She is very curious about the world around her.  She questions everything. She is always asking questions. Some people don't like that. They think she is strange or rude. They tell her to stop asking questions. She doesn't care what they think. She just keeps asking questions. Every time she asks a question in the film that annoys someone, an audience member lets out a laugh. I laugh along with them. I can't help it. I am so happy that I am not like the other kids. 

The lights come on. It's time for intermission. I walk out of the theater and go to the concession stand. Everyone is being served popcorn. I ask for some popcorn as well. Another audience member asks me how I'm enjoying the film so far. ""It's a great story so far! I can't wait to see how it ends."" 
The lights dim again and the film resumes.
 The little girl is now a teenager. Then she is a young adult. By the time I'd finished half of my popcorn, she was an elderly woman in her 70s. She is still curious and still asking questions. One day, she thinks of the most brilliant question. She asks, ""What is the meaning of life?"" She writes down the question in her book.

I choose a private box seat. 
The reason I choose a private box seat is because I want to be able to see everything that is going on.

As the film continues, I start to notice that the little girl is very different from the other children.
 She is constantly looking up at the stars. She is very curious about the world around her.  She questions everything. She is always asking questions. Some people don't like that. They think she is strange or rude. They tell her to stop asking questions. She doesn't care what they think. She just keeps asking questions. Every time she asks a question in the film that annoys someone, an audience member lets out a laugh. I laugh along with them. I can't help it. I am so happy that I am not like the other kids.

 The little girl is now a teenager. Then she is a young adult. By the time I'd finished half of my popcorn, she was an elderly woman in her 70s. She is still curious and still asking questions.

The reason I choose a private box seat is because I want to be able to see everything that is going on.
 I want to be able to see the people, the places, and the things that I will be doing in my next life. I am very excited to see how this goes.  The lights start to dim as the film begins to play. I am sitting on the edge of my seat. The film is about a little girl who is about to be born. She is a very special little girl. It will take her many years to realize just how special she is. 
As the film continues, I start to notice that the little girl is very different from the other children.
 She is constantly looking up at the stars. She is very curious about the world around her.  She questions everything. She is always asking questions. Some people don't like that. They think she is strange or rude. They tell her to stop asking questions. She doesn't care what they think. She just keeps asking questions. Every time she asks a question in the film that annoys someone, an audience member lets out a laugh. I laugh along with them. I can't help it. I am so happy that I am not like the other kids. 

The lights come on. It's time for intermission. I walk out of the theater and go to the concession stand. Everyone is being served popcorn. I ask for some popcorn as well. Another audience member asks me how I'm enjoying the film so far. ""It's a great story so far! I can't wait to see how it ends."" 
The lights dim again and the film resumes.
 The little girl is now a teenager. Then she is a young adult. By the time I'd finished half of my popcorn, she was an elderly woman in her 70s. She is still curious and still asking questions. One day, she thinks of the most brilliant question. She asks, ""What is the meaning of life?"" She writes down the question in her book. 
The lights come on again.

I am sitting on the edge of my seat. The film is about a little girl who is about to be born. She is a very special little girl. It will take her many years to realize just how special she is. 
As the film continues, I start to notice that the little girl is very different from the other children.
 She is constantly looking up at the stars. She is very curious about the world around her.  She questions everything. She is always asking questions. Some people don't like that. They think she is strange or rude. They tell her to stop asking questions. She doesn't care what they think. She just keeps asking questions. Every time she asks a question in the film that annoys someone, an audience member lets out a laugh. I laugh along with them. I can't help it. I am so happy that I am not like the other kids. 

The lights come on. It's time for intermission. I walk out of the theater and go to the concession stand. Everyone is being served popcorn. I ask for some popcorn as well. Another audience member asks me how I'm enjoying the film so far. ""It's a great story so far! I can't wait to see how it ends."" 
The lights dim again and the film resumes.
 The little girl is now a teenager. Then she is a young adult. By the time I'd finished half of my popcorn, she was an elderly woman in her 70s. She is still curious and still asking questions. One day, she thinks of the most brilliant question. She asks, ""What is the meaning of life?"" She writes down the question in her book. 
The lights come on again.

 I want to be able to see the people, the places, and the things that I will be doing in my next life. I am very excited to see how this goes.  The lights start to dim as the film begins to play. I am sitting on the edge of my seat. The film is about a little girl who is about to be born. She is a very special little girl. It will take her many years to realize just how special she is. 
As the film continues, I start to notice that the little girl is very different from the other children.
 She is constantly looking up at the stars. She is very curious about the world around her.  She questions everything. She is always asking questions. Some people don't like that. They think she is strange or rude. They tell her to stop asking questions. She doesn't care what they think. She just keeps asking questions. Every time she asks a question in the film that annoys someone, an audience member lets out a laugh. I laugh along with them. I can't help it. I am so happy that I am not like the other kids. 

The lights come on. It's time for intermission. I walk out of the theater and go to the concession stand. Everyone is being served popcorn. I ask for some popcorn as well. Another audience member asks me how I'm enjoying the film so far. ""It's a great story so far! I can't wait to see how it ends."" 
The lights dim again and the film resumes.
 The little girl is now a teenager. Then she is a young adult. By the time I'd finished half of my popcorn, she was an elderly woman in her 70s. She is still curious and still asking questions. One day, she thinks of the most brilliant question. She asks, ""What is the meaning of life?"" She writes down the question in her book. 
The lights come on again.
 The film has ended. ""That's it?"" I ask out loud. ""That's the end?"" Someone behind her responds. ""What would you rather? Li",2251,[],0,2,5,30,0.3,1,0,0,1361

I choose a private box seat. 
The reason I choose a private box seat is because I want to be able to see everything that is going on.
 I want to be able to see the people, the places, and the things that I will be doing in my next life. I am very excited to see how this goes.  The lights start to dim as the film begins to play. I am sitting on the edge of my seat. The film is about a little girl who is about to be born. She is a very special little girl. It will take her many years to realize just how special she is. 
As the film continues, I start to notice that the little girl is very different from the other children.
 She is constantly looking up at the stars. She is very curious about the world around her.  She questions everything. She is always asking questions. Some people don't like that. They think she is strange or rude. They tell her to stop asking questions. She doesn't care what they think. She just keeps asking questions. Every time she asks a question in the film that annoys someone, an audience member lets out a laugh. I laugh along with them. I can't help it. I am so happy that I am not like the other kids. 

The lights come on. It's time for intermission. I walk out of the theater and go to the concession stand. Everyone is being served popcorn. I ask for some popcorn as well. Another audience member asks me how I'm enjoying the film so far. ""It's a great story so far! I can't wait to see how it ends."" 
The lights dim again and the film resumes.
 The little girl is now a teenager. Then she is a young adult. By the time I'd finished half of my popcorn, she was an elderly woman in her 70s. She is still curious and still asking questions. One day, she thinks of the most brilliant question. She asks, ""What is the meaning of life?"" She writes down the question in her book.

I am sitting on the edge of my seat. The film is about a little girl who is about to be born. She is a very special little girl. It will take her many years to realize just how special she is. 
As the film continues, I start to notice that the little girl is very different from the other children.
 She is constantly looking up at the stars. She is very curious about the world around her.  She questions everything. She is always asking questions. Some people don't like that. They think she is strange or rude. They tell her to stop asking questions. She doesn't care what they think. She just keeps asking questions. Every time she asks a question in the film that annoys someone, an audience member lets out a laugh. I laugh along with them. I can't help it. I am so happy that I am not like the other kids. 

The lights come on. It's time for intermission. I walk out of the theater and go to the concession stand. Everyone is being served popcorn. I ask for some popcorn as well. Another audience member asks me how I'm enjoying the film so far. ""It's a great story so far! I can't wait to see how it ends."" 
The lights dim again and the film resumes.
 The little girl is now a teenager. Then she is a young adult. By the time I'd finished half of my popcorn, she was an elderly woman in her 70s. She is still curious and still asking questions. One day, she thinks of the most brilliant question. She asks, ""What is the meaning of life?"" She writes down the question in her book. 
The lights come on again.

I choose a private box seat. 
The reason I choose a private box seat is because I want to be able to see everything that is going on.
 I want to be able to see the people, the places, and the things that I will be doing in my next life. I am very excited to see how this goes.  The lights start to dim as the film begins to play. I am sitting on the edge of my seat. The film is about a little girl who is about to be born. She is a very special little girl. It will take her many years to realize just how special she is. 
As the film continues, I start to notice that the little girl is very different from the other children.
 She is constantly looking up at the stars. She is very curious about the world around her.  She questions everything. She is always asking questions. Some people don't like that. They think she is strange or rude. They tell her to stop asking questions. She doesn't care what they think. She just keeps asking questions. Every time she asks a question in the film that annoys someone, an audience member lets out a laugh. I laugh along with them. I can't help it. I am so happy that I am not like the other kids. 

The lights come on. It's time for intermission. I walk out of the theater and go to the concession stand. Everyone is being served popcorn. I ask for some popcorn as well. Another audience member asks me how I'm enjoying the film so far. ""It's a great story so far! I can't wait to see how it ends."" 
The lights dim again and the film resumes.
 The little girl is now a teenager. Then she is a young adult. By the time I'd finished half of my popcorn, she was an elderly woman in her 70s. She is still curious and still asking questions. One day, she thinks of the most brilliant question. She asks, ""What is the meaning of life?"" She writes down the question in her book.
