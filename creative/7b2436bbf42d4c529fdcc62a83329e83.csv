But now, hMattwDamon as gone.
 he alien had no idea what he had done., and if he had known better, he would have left Earth. But he didn't, and now he had to deal with the consequences.  
The alien had been on Earth for a few days, and had been on the run from the military.
 He had been shot down after abducting the actor, and had crash-landed in the middle of nowhere. He had been lucky that they had survived the crash, and had been even luckier that he had found a small town nearby. 

But somewhere along the lines, he had mistaken Matt Damon for a ruler of the US, or political leader, and thought it would give him bargaining power.  How wrong he was.  The alien's next mistake was walking Matt Damon into the town near the crash site, where many fans recognized him.  It was soon all over Tik-Tok and Twitter that Matt Damon was in Erie, Kansas, and the town population doubled overnight. 

The alien was hungry. He held the controls on Matt Damon's control collar. as he tried to head to the grocery store. He was stopped by a mob of people. ""LET HIM GO"", they chanted. People began to throw things. Several boys aimed their drones towards the alien and divebombed him. 

The alien retreated back to his cave. He didn't realize the crowd had followed him.  He would have no peace until he released Matt Damon back to his fans. He had underestimated the power of pop-culture.  The alien dejectedly allow Matt Damon to return to the throng. Huge cheers erupted.  The Alien was quickly forgotten by all, as they welcomed their hero back to their midst.
