Today is the culmination of all of our hard work; the energy from the Mana would be focused into a vessel, granting them extraordinary power. he ceremony was taking place in the centr rof the city, in a large open area.
 Large, needlelike stones stood around the ring, focusing the Mana's flow.   The energy would be focused into a single person, who would become the savior of humanity. 

I watched in awe as more and more people showed up for the choosing ceremony. 
The Mana was flowing through the city, and the needle-like stones were glowing brightly. On an Altar in the middle of the room, 
the energy wisped into a curling ball of rolling light. It was beautiful. 
The light seemed to be taking a form, and I could see a shape in the center of the light.
 It was a man, with a long, flowing cloak. But it faded away, and was replaced by another. This one was a woman, with long, flowing hair.  Several other forms appeared and then vanished inside the swirling light. 
The light faded away, and the crowd began to murmur.
 I turned to see The high priest Diovar from the far-away city of Capernus, and his purple hooded acolytes make their way to the middle of the ring. he High Priest raised his arms, and the crowd fell silent.
 ""The time has come,"" he said. ""The Mana has chosen its vessel.""

Suddenly, without warning, laser fire broke out. The trees nearby were flattened, as the cloaked alien cruisers lowered to the ground. 
he crowd began to panic.

he aliens were tall, with long, gangly limbs.
 With their natural strength, they leaped from the ship,  ripping apart the innocent citizens with their bare hands.

 Large, needlelike stones stood around the ring, focusing the Mana's flow.   The energy would be focused into a single person, who would become the savior of humanity. 

I watched in awe as more and more people showed up for the choosing ceremony. 
The Mana was flowing through the city, and the needle-like stones were glowing brightly. On an Altar in the middle of the room, 
the energy wisped into a curling ball of rolling light. It was beautiful. 
The light seemed to be taking a form, and I could see a shape in the center of the light.
 It was a man, with a long, flowing cloak. But it faded away, and was replaced by another. This one was a woman, with long, flowing hair.  Several other forms appeared and then vanished inside the swirling light. 
The light faded away, and the crowd began to murmur.
 I turned to see The high priest Diovar from the far-away city of Capernus, and his purple hooded acolytes make their way to the middle of the ring. he High Priest raised his arms, and the crowd fell silent.
 ""The time has come,"" he said. ""The Mana has chosen its vessel.""

Suddenly, without warning, laser fire broke out. The trees nearby were flattened, as the cloaked alien cruisers lowered to the ground.

 Large, needlelike stones stood around the ring, focusing the Mana's flow.   The energy would be focused into a single person, who would become the savior of humanity. 

I watched in awe as more and more people showed up for the choosing ceremony. 
The Mana was flowing through the city, and the needle-like stones were glowing brightly. On an Altar in the middle of the room, 
the energy wisped into a curling ball of rolling light. It was beautiful. 
The light seemed to be taking a form, and I could see a shape in the center of the light.
 It was a man, with a long, flowing cloak. But it faded away, and was replaced by another. This one was a woman, with long, flowing hair.  Several other forms appeared and then vanished inside the swirling light. 
The light faded away, and the crowd began to murmur.
 I turned to see The high priest Diovar from the far-away city of Capernus, and his purple hooded acolytes make their way to the middle of the ring. he High Priest raised his arms, and the crowd fell silent.

I watched in awe as more and more people showed up for the choosing ceremony. 
The Mana was flowing through the city, and the needle-like stones were glowing brightly. On an Altar in the middle of the room, 
the energy wisped into a curling ball of rolling light. It was beautiful. 
The light seemed to be taking a form, and I could see a shape in the center of the light.
 It was a man, with a long, flowing cloak. But it faded away, and was replaced by another. This one was a woman, with long, flowing hair.  Several other forms appeared and then vanished inside the swirling light. 
The light faded away, and the crowd began to murmur.
 I turned to see The high priest Diovar from the far-away city of Capernus, and his purple hooded acolytes make their way to the middle of the ring. he High Priest raised his arms, and the crowd fell silent.

Today is the culmination of all of our hard work; the energy from the Mana would be focused into a vessel, granting them extraordinary power. he ceremony was taking place in the centr rof the city, in a large open area.
 Large, needlelike stones stood around the ring, focusing the Mana's flow.   The energy would be focused into a single person, who would become the savior of humanity. 

I watched in awe as more and more people showed up for the choosing ceremony. 
The Mana was flowing through the city, and the needle-like stones were glowing brightly. On an Altar in the middle of the room, 
the energy wisped into a curling ball of rolling light. It was beautiful. 
The light seemed to be taking a form, and I could see a shape in the center of the light.
 It was a man, with a long, flowing cloak. But it faded away, and was replaced by another. This one was a woman, with long, flowing hair.  Several other forms appeared and then vanished inside the swirling light. 
The light faded away, and the crowd began to murmur.
 I turned to see The high priest Diovar from the far-away city of Capernus, and his purple hooded acolytes make their way to the middle of the ring. he High Priest raised his arms, and the crowd fell silent.
 ""The time has come,"" he said. ""The Mana has chosen its vessel."" 
The Mana has chosen...""



Suddenly, without warning, laser fire broke out. The trees nearby were flattened, as the cloaked alien cruisers lowered to the ground. 
he crowd began to panic.
 The Aliens had arrived. 
he aliens were tall, with long, gangly limbs.
 With their natural strength, they leaped from the ship,  ripping apart the innocent citizens with their bare hands.   

I noticed a charge land on the Altar. ""The Mana"" I yelled. I saw the altar be blown apart, in millions of pieces, the light went out from the mana globe. There was a loud ringing noise, and then everything went black for ",2179,[],0,0,5,30,0.3,1,0,0,1569
