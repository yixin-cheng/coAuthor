It was awkward to say the least... Scientists couldn't tell us how or why it had happened, but needless to say, it quickly became a global hot topic and a serious issue for pretty much every family in the world. eople were losing their minds - everywhere we went, we would see people screaming at one another,: men fighting with their wives, kids in tears, brothers getting up in arms about long-forgotten sibling disputes. It was as if the whole world had completely lost their minds all at once.

It was a dark time, too. A lot of my friends lost their dads over it, either because they walked out on their families or, well... worse. Some dads managed to get rankings up in a few hundreds, and they started appearing en masse on talk shows to share parenting tips and talk about how much they loved their kids. But this only made all the long-string-of-digits dads even more riled up. There was one kind of amusing case with my sister's ex's cousin's dad, though - it turns out he wasn't even her dad! His mug went blank when he held it, and that was definitely confusing for a while until his wife came clean about the real dad. Hoo boy, I would not have wanted to be in that room when that news broke, though.

So basically, it's been rough for everybody, but we're all slowly learning to deal with it. The police have had a much easier time convicting abusive dads for one thing, and a lot of marriage counselors are making bank. Kids are less afraid to speak out about their rights as people and parents are really listening to them. So I guess that does bring a little bit of good out of it, right?

Still, the whole world is extremely obsessed with one question above all: who is the #1 dad? The answer is still a huge mystery, even bigger than why this mug thing happened in the first place. There are a lot of theories about it, of course, and everyone has an opinion, but no one knows.

Scientists couldn't tell us how or why it had happened, but needless to say, it quickly became a global hot topic and a serious issue for pretty much every family in the world. eople were losing their minds - everywhere we went, we would see people screaming at one another,: men fighting with their wives, kids in tears, brothers getting up in arms about long-forgotten sibling disputes. It was as if the whole world had completely lost their minds all at once.

It was a dark time, too. A lot of my friends lost their dads over it, either because they walked out on their families or, well... worse. Some dads managed to get rankings up in a few hundreds, and they started appearing en masse on talk shows to share parenting tips and talk about how much they loved their kids. But this only made all the long-string-of-digits dads even more riled up. There was one kind of amusing case with my sister's ex's cousin's dad, though - it turns out he wasn't even her dad! His mug went blank when he held it, and that was definitely confusing for a while until his wife came clean about the real dad. Hoo boy, I would not have wanted to be in that room when that news broke, though.

So basically, it's been rough for everybody, but we're all slowly learning to deal with it. The police have had a much easier time convicting abusive dads for one thing, and a lot of marriage counselors are making bank. Kids are less afraid to speak out about their rights as people and parents are really listening to them. So I guess that does bring a little bit of good out of it, right?

Still, the whole world is extremely obsessed with one question above all: who is the #1 dad? The answer is still a huge mystery, even bigger than why this mug thing happened in the first place. There are a lot of theories about it, of course, and everyone has an opinion, but no one knows.

It was awkward to say the least... Scientists couldn't tell us how or why it had happened, but needless to say, it quickly became a global hot topic and a serious issue for pretty much every family in the world. eople were losing their minds - everywhere we went, we would see people screaming at one another,: men fighting with their wives, kids in tears, brothers getting up in arms about long-forgotten sibling disputes. It was as if the whole world had completely lost their minds all at once.

It was a dark time, too. A lot of my friends lost their dads over it, either because they walked out on their families or, well... worse. Some dads managed to get rankings up in a few hundreds, and they started appearing en masse on talk shows to share parenting tips and talk about how much they loved their kids.

So basically, it's been rough for everybody, but we're all slowly learning to deal with it.

It was awkward to say the least... Scientists couldn't tell us how or why it had happened, but needless to say, it quickly became a global hot topic and a serious issue for pretty much every family in the world. eople were losing their minds - everywhere we went, we would see people screaming at one another,: men fighting with their wives, kids in tears, brothers getting up in arms about long-forgotten sibling disputes. It was as if the whole world had completely lost their minds all at once.

It was a dark time, too. A lot of my friends lost their dads over it, either because they walked out on their families or, well... worse. Some dads managed to get rankings up in a few hundreds, and they started appearing en masse on talk shows to share parenting tips and talk about how much they loved their kids.

Hoo boy, I would not have wanted to be in that room when that news broke, though.

So basically, it's been rough for everybody, but we're all slowly learning to deal with it. The police have had a much easier time convicting abusive dads for one thing, and a lot of marriage counselors are making bank. Kids are less afraid to speak out about their rights as people and parents are really listening to them. So I guess that does bring a little bit of good out of it, right?
