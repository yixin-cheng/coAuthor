It seemed that this alien wasn't just studying Earth's culture, it was searching Earth for a way to colonize Mars for it's own alien race. Humanity was lucky these aliens were considerate enough to not want to invade and share Earth, they were just looking for a way to somehow live on a brand new and empty planet!

Humanity was lucky these aliens were considerate enough to not want to invade and share Earth, they were just looking for a way to somehow live on a brand new and empty planet!
