The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" Not only did the wolf not threaten to huff and puff and blow the door down, but neither the wolf, nor anyone else, would go anywhere near the place. This little pig became depressed. He had no friends, because he was a pig who lived in a house made of depleted uranium. What a lonely existence he faced. The 92nd little pig woke up every day to the same disappointing life. He thought of ending it all, but he was passionate about the cause he had protested against so many times. He would not do anything to support baconism. The baconists would not have him for breakfast, not today and not ever.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" Not only did the wolf not threaten to huff and puff and blow the door down, but neither the wolf, nor anyone else, would go anywhere near the place. This little pig became depressed. He had no friends, because he was a pig who lived in a house made of depleted uranium. What a lonely existence he faced. The 92nd little pig woke up every day to the same disappointing life. He thought of ending it all, but he was passionate about the cause he had protested against so many times. He would not do anything to support baconism. The baconists would not have him for breakfast, not today and not ever.

Still, the 92nd little pig struggled to find the will to live. His bacon lives matter work was meaningful, but did not fulfill his innermost needs. He had never had a close friend, or even a visitor to his home. He lived in shame, and had been unable to form strong relationships, with anyone. He had never been in love. He had never been in a relationship. He had never even had a date. His world was built of isolated despair, with a foundation in depleted uranium.

The 92nd little pig wept at night, until he fell asleep. He woke up to the horrible realization that he would have to live another day on this mound of cancerous toxicity. He would have to face the world again. He looked for reasons to leave the house each day. He would go for a trough, at the local troughery, even when he wasn't hungry. He would chat with the person serving his food, but he could never come to terms with his shoddy foundation and never allowed a true friendship to form. 

He would go to the local pub, where he would drink to excess, and then vomit in the street. This led to both physical and emotional ruin.

The 92nd little pig wept at night, until he fell asleep. He woke up to the horrible realization that he would have to live another day on this mound of cancerous toxicity. He would have to face the world again. He looked for reasons to leave the house each day. He would go for a trough, at the local troughery, even when he wasn't hungry. He would chat with the person serving his food, but he could never come to terms with his shoddy foundation and never allowed a true friendship to form. 

He would go to the local pub, where he would drink to excess, and then vomit in the street. This led to both physical and emotional ruin. After several years of crippling addiction, the 92nd little pig died alone, on a park bench which was later revealed to be mildly radioactive and had to be removed.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" Not only did the wolf not threaten to huff and puff and blow the door down, but neither the wolf, nor anyone else, would go anywhere near the place. This little pig became depressed. He had no friends, because he was a pig who lived in a house made of depleted uranium. What a lonely existence he faced. The 92nd little pig woke up every day to the same disappointing life. He thought of ending it all, but he was passionate about the cause he had protested against so many times. He would not do anything to support baconism. The baconists would not have him for breakfast, not today and not ever.

Still, the 92nd little pig struggled to find the will to live. His bacon lives matter work was meaningful, but did not fulfill his innermost needs. He had never had a close friend, or even a visitor to his home. He lived in shame, and had been unable to form strong relationships, with anyone. He had never been in love. He had never been in a relationship. He had never even had a date. His world was built of isolated despair, with a foundation in depleted uranium.
