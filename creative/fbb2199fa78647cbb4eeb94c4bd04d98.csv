 You feel a pinch, unlike any you've ever felt before. Suddenly, you're aware of the entire hive's thoughts. You know what everyone is doing, and you are given the ability to control every bee in the hive. The only thing you can't feel is your own body... You feel powerful, but scared. 

There's a sense of urgency, but you're not sure why. The bees seem to feel like they're in danger, and will soon have to go into hiding. What's more, you can feel the weather changing. A powerful storm is coming, and soon. You decide to send the bees away, before they're caught in the storm. You work your magic, and the bees fly off in random directions, some out of your range of control. 
You browse the human world, looking for somewhere safe for your bees to stay.
  You find an abandoned house, big enough for the hive. You give the bees some well-placed guiding thoughts, and soon they're all settled in. You feel satisfied, knowing that your hive is safe. 
You break contact with the other bees, and become aware of your body again.
 You feel... tired, but good. You look around, trying to figure out what happened. You're still in the bee field, but all the bees are gone. You decide to walk home, the buzzing in your head finally fading away.

 You always knew they had a hive mind, but you didn't know that they could talk! You quickly reason that you should try and get it off of you before it stings you. You reach for the bee, hoping to pick it up. 
You grab the bee, and it stings you on your exposed wrist.
 You feel a pinch, unlike any you've ever felt before. Suddenly, you're aware of the entire hive's thoughts. You know what everyone is doing, and you are given the ability to control every bee in the hive. The only thing you can't feel is your own body... You feel powerful, but scared. 

There's a sense of urgency, but you're not sure why. The bees seem to feel like they're in danger, and will soon have to go into hiding. What's more, you can feel the weather changing. A powerful storm is coming, and soon. You decide to send the bees away, before they're caught in the storm. You work your magic, and the bees fly off in random directions, some out of your range of control. 
You browse the human world, looking for somewhere safe for your bees to stay.
  You find an abandoned house, big enough for the hive. You give the bees some well-placed guiding thoughts, and soon they're all settled in. You feel satisfied, knowing that your hive is safe. 
You break contact with the other bees, and become aware of your body again.
 You feel... tired, but good. You look around, trying to figure out what happened. You're still in the bee field, but all the bees are gone. You decide to walk home, the buzzing in your head finally fading away.

 You always knew they had a hive mind, but you didn't know that they could talk! You quickly reason that you should try and get it off of you before it stings you. You reach for the bee, hoping to pick it up. 
You grab the bee, and it stings you on your exposed wrist.
 You feel a pinch, unlike any you've ever felt before. Suddenly, you're aware of the entire hive's thoughts. You know what everyone is doing, and you are given the ability to control every bee in the hive. The only thing you can't feel is your own body... You feel powerful, but scared. 

There's a sense of urgency, but you're not sure why. The bees seem to feel like they're in danger, and will soon have to go into hiding. What's more, you can feel the weather changing. A powerful storm is coming, and soon. You decide to send the bees away, before they're caught in the storm. You work your magic, and the bees fly off in random directions, some out of your range of control. 
You browse the human world, looking for somewhere safe for your bees to stay.
  You find an abandoned house, big enough for the hive. You give the bees some well-placed guiding thoughts, and soon they're all settled in. You feel satisfied, knowing that your hive is safe. 
You break contact with the other bees, and become aware of your body again.
 You feel... tired, but good. You look around, trying to figure out what happened. You're still in the bee field, but all the bees are gone. You decide to walk home, the buzzing in your head finally fading away.

 You always knew they had a hive mind, but you didn't know that they could talk! You quickly reason that you should try and get it off of you before it stings you. You reach for the bee, hoping to pick it up. 
You grab the bee, and it stings you on your exposed wrist.
 You feel a pinch, unlike any you've ever felt before. Suddenly, you're aware of the entire hive's thoughts. You know what everyone is doing, and you are given the ability to control every bee in the hive. The only thing you can't feel is your own body... You feel powerful, but scared. 

There's a sense of urgency, but you're not sure why. The bees seem to feel like they're in danger, and will soon have to go into hiding. What's more, you can feel the weather changing. A powerful storm is coming, and soon. You decide to send the bees away, before they're caught in the storm. You work your magic, and the bees fly off in random directions, some out of your range of control. 
You browse the human world, looking for somewhere safe for your bees to stay.
  You find an abandoned house, big enough for the hive. You give the bees some well-placed guiding thoughts, and soon they're all settled in. You feel satisfied, knowing that your hive is safe. 
You break contact with the other bees, and become aware of your body again.
 You feel... tired, but good. You look around, trying to figure out what happened. You're still in the bee field, but all the bees are gone. You decide to walk home, the buzzing in your head finally fading away.

 You always knew they had a hive mind, but you didn't know that they could talk! You quickly reason that you should try and get it off of you before it stings you. You reach for the bee, hoping to pick it up. 
You grab the bee, and it stings you on your exposed wrist.
 You feel a pinch, unlike any you've ever felt before. Suddenly, you're aware of the entire hive's thoughts. You know what everyone is doing, and you are given the ability to control every bee in the hive. The only thing you can't feel is your own body... You feel powerful, but scared. 

There's a sense of urgency, but you're not sure why. The bees seem to feel like they're in danger, and will soon have to go into hiding. What's more, you can feel the weather changing. A powerful storm is coming, and soon. You decide to send the bees away, before they're caught in the storm. You work your magic, and the bees fly off in random directions, some out of your range of control. 
You browse the human world, looking for somewhere safe for your bees to stay.
  You find an abandoned house, big enough for the hive. You give the bees some well-placed guiding thoughts, and soon they're all settled in. You feel satisfied, knowing that your hive is safe. 
You break contact with the other bees, and become aware of your body again.
 You feel... tired, but good. You look around, trying to figure out what happened. You're still in the bee field, but all the bees are gone. You decide to walk home, the buzzing in your head finally fading away.

 You always knew they had a hive mind, but you didn't know that they could talk! You quickly reason that you should try and get it off of you before it stings you. You reach for the bee, hoping to pick it up. 
You grab the bee, and it stings you on your exposed wrist.
 You feel a pinch, unlike any you've ever felt before. Suddenly, you're aware of the entire hive's thoughts. You know what everyone is doing, and you are given the ability to control every bee in the hive. The only thing you can't feel is your own body... You feel powerful, but scared. 

There's a sense of urgency, but you're not sure why. The bees seem to feel like they're in danger, and will soon have to go into hiding. What's more, you can feel the weather changing. A powerful storm is coming, and soon. You decide to send the bees away, before they're caught in the storm. You work your magic, and the bees fly off in random directions, some out of your range of control. 
You browse the human world, looking for somewhere safe for your bees to stay.
  You find an abandoned house, big enough for the hive. You give the bees some well-placed guiding thoughts, and soon they're all settled in. You feel satisfied, knowing that your hive is safe. 
You break contact with the other bees, and become aware of your body again.
 You feel... tired, but good. You look around, trying to figure out what happened. You're still in the bee field, but all the bees are gone. You decide to walk home, the buzzing in your head finally fading away.

How has this happened? What does it mean for you? 
You're not sure what you've gotten yourself into.

 You feel... tired, but good. You look around, trying to figure out what happened. You're still in the bee field, but all the bees are gone. You decide to walk home, the buzzing in your head finally fading away.

 ou frantically flip through your mental notes of all the things you've learned about bees.
 You always knew they had a hive mind, but you didn't know that they could talk! You quickly reason that you should try and get it off of you before it stings you. You reach for the bee, hoping to pick it up and move it off your shoulder. 
You grab the bee, and it stings you on your exposed wrist.
 You feel a sharp pain, and a pinch, unlike any you've ever felt before. Suddenly, you're aware of the entire hive's thoughts. You know what everyone is doing, and you are given the ability to control every bee in the hive. The only thing you can't feel is your own body... You feel powerful, but scared. 

There's a sense of urgency, but you're not sure why. The bees seem to feel like they're in danger, and will soon have to go into hiding. What's more, you can feel the weather changing.
