""Dad, Dadddddddd"" Ben calls plaintively. ""Come see this!"" There is a tone of uncertainty and fright in his voice, so I drop everything and went quickly into the house. 
""What's up, Ben?"" I ask.
 He points to the mug on the mantlepiece. It's a gift my kids gave me for Father's Day, a large, gaudy mug. It's a mug that had said ""#1 Dad"" on it, and it's a mug that I've always thought was a bit silly. But now, it's different. I am now #2. 

I laugh. ""Who's a better dad than me?"" I ask. Dad, it's not funny,"" Ben says.
 ""The numbers keep changing!"" I look at the mug again, and it's true.
My ranking keeps going down! I look at the other mugs, and they're all changing too. 

I notice the mug we bought Julie: Large and gaudy, with loud and obnoxious colors, it's the counterpart to mine. It used to say ""#1 Mom"" on it. Now I can't even read the ranking. It's changing too fast, and there's way to many numbers. ""Uh, we're going to have to hide this before she sees it,"" I say.  Why?""
 Ben asks. ""Because she'll be really upset if she thinks she's not the best mom in the world."" 
""But she's not the best mom in the world,"" Ben says.
 ""She's not even the best mom in this house."" 
What do you mean?"" I ask.
 ""Well, you're the best mom and dad in this house,"" Ben says. ""And I'm the best kid in this house.""
