 The alien told Matt that he was going to study him for a while and then eat him. ""But its not exactly what is called 'eat' in your language,"" said the alien. ""I don't chew you and I don't digest you.""

""So what do you do?"" asked Matt.
The alien looked him right in the eye and said, ""I swallow you whole.""


""Great,"" Matt said. ""This is turning into a freaking perfect day! First I find out I'm broke, and now I'm food for some  little green freak.""

""I'm not green, "" protested the alien. ""I'm eau de Nil.""

After boarding the alien's ship, Matt and the alien watch through the porthole as the white ""Hollywood"" sign got progressively smaller beneath them.
They flew for awhile, and finally started talking to each other.
 The alien told Matt that he was going to study him for a while and then eat him. ""But its not exactly what is called 'eat' in your language,"" said the alien. ""I don't chew you and I don't digest you.""

""So what do you do?"" asked Matt.
The alien looked him right in the eye and said, ""I swallow you whole.""


""Great,"" Matt said. ""This is turning into a freaking perfect day! First I find out I'm broke, and now I'm food for some  little green freak.""

""I'm not green, "" protested the alien. ""I'm eau de Nil.""
""I didn't know you were wearing cologne,"" said Matt.


""It's not a scent, it's a color, you cretinous fool,"" said the alien.
""I know what eau de Nil is,"" said Matt.
 ""I've been to France.""
""Good for you, "" snorted the alien.
 ""Now prepare to be eaten.""
""Just one question first,"" said Matt.
 ""What's your name?""
""My name's Jean-Luc,"" said the alien.

""That's a pretty name,"" said Matt., and put his hand on one of the alien's protuberances. ""I mean, for a guy with a third nipple.""
""Let go of my tit, you homo,"" said Jean-Luc.

""I'm not gay,"" said Matt.
 ""Not that there's anything wrong with it.""
""You're going to be gay if you don't let go of my tit,"" said Jean-Luc.


""Don't wanna,"" Matt replied.

Several hours passed. The Hollywood sign was again visible through the ship's window, this time getting larger.
