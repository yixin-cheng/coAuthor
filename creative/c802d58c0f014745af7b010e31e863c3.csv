One day, she is texting with a new man she is interested in. It’s the shapeshifter. This time, he's going by the name Truman. 
“I’m going to be honest with you,” she says.
 “I’ve been with a lot of guys, and I’ve never felt this way.” She paused a moment, and then said ""I think I'm falling in love with you.""

 ""I'm so glad I can tell you at last."" 
“Tell me what?” she asked.
 Suddenly there was a knock at the door. She opened it, and there stood Truman. She gasped. ""Truman!""

""I'm here to tell you that I love you. I have always loved you. Will you marry me?"" 
""Yes!"" she said.
 They embraced and he said, ""I've been waiting years to say that."" She was confused. They had only known each other for a few months. ""Years?"" she asked. He nodded.

“Tell me what?” she asked.
 Suddenly there was a knock at the door. She opened it, and there stood Truman. She gasped. ""Truman!""
