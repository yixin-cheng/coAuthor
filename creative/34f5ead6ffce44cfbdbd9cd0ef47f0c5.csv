You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand. Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?""

You look around wondering where the voice came from. The bee continues ""I am here to guard you and carry out your orders. What would you have of me?"" You think that maybe you have been stung already, and are having strange hallucinations now. The bee says ""It is safe to speak. It's only us here right now.""

You look around to make sure, and finally say ""How is it that a bee is talking to me?"" The bee responds ""All bees can talk, your majesty. You have always had the gift of hearing us and talking with us also. We know that everyone has told you that you are allergic to us, but you are not. Not really. I think that maybe people didn't want you to know because they thought that you would go crazy, or other people would think you are crazy."" 

You ask the bee what does it mean by ""what are your orders"" what can a bee do for you, you think to yourself. The bee responds ""We can do anything you need."" You test the bee, and ask for some honey for your tea. The bee says ""It will be done"" and lifts off the ground, and flies into your cupboard. Soon it returns with a tiny jar of honey. You are so shocked that you storm of to ask your father about why you can talk to bees. He replies matter of fact ""You are not allergic to bees. Yes you can talk to them. That is because you are the Queen of Bees.""

You look around to make sure, and finally say ""How is it that a bee is talking to me?"" The bee responds ""All bees can talk, your majesty.

You ask the bee what does it mean by ""what are your orders"" what can a bee do for you, you think to yourself. The bee responds ""We can do anything you need."" You test the bee, and ask for some honey for your tea. The bee says ""It will be done"" and lifts off the ground, and flies into your cupboard. Soon it returns with a tiny jar of honey.

You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand. Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?""

You look around wondering where the voice came from. The bee continues ""I am here to guard you and carry out your orders. What would you have of me?"" You think that maybe you have been stung already, and are having strange hallucinations now. The bee says ""It is safe to speak. It's only us here right now.""

You look around to make sure, and finally say ""How is it that a bee is talking to me?"" The bee responds ""All bees can talk, your majesty. You have always had the gift of hearing us and talking with us also. We know that everyone has told you that you are allergic to us, but you are not. Not really. I think that maybe people didn't want you to know because they thought that you would go crazy, or other people would think you are crazy."" 

You ask the bee what does it mean by ""what are your orders"" what can a bee do for you, you think to yourself. The bee responds ""We can do anything you need."" You test the bee, and ask for some honey for your tea. The bee says ""It will be done"" and lifts off the ground, and flies into your cupboard. Soon it returns with a tiny jar of honey. You are so shocked that you storm of to ask your father about why you can talk to bees. He replies matter of fact ""You are not allergic to bees. Yes you can talk to them. That is because you are the Queen of Bees.""

You recoil, and ask him to explain himself. He says ""You are the queen of all the bees in this area. That you were cursed by a witch to live as a human because a bee stung her on your orders from what I understand. So we raised you from a child.""
