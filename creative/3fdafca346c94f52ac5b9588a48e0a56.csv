I pulled my coffee mug out of the cabinet one morning and a peculiar thing happened. The mug, which had always read ""#1 Dad"" suddenly changed to ""#4 Dad."" I didn't understand why this was happening so I decided to call my dad. Dad, I just pulled out my ""1 Dad""mug and it changed to ""4 Dad.."" I told him.

I figured #4 is still really good so I wasn't too worried about it.

 I wondered why it had gone down. I called my dad and he said, ""I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted again.""

I pulled my coffee mug out of the cabinet one morning and a peculiar thing happened. The mug, which had always read ""#1 Dad"" suddenly changed to ""#4 Dad."" I didn't understand why this was happening so I decided to call my dad. Dad, I just pulled out my ""1 Dad""mug and it changed to ""4 Dad.."" I told him. And he said, ""Oh, I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted."" I didn't understand. But he told me about a news story he saw last night. Apparently all of the #1 Dad mugs in the world have been randomly changing ranking to reflect the actual ranking of dads. So now I'm #4 Dad.

 I wondered why it had gone down. I called my dad and he said, ""I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted again.""

I played with my kids, I took them to the park, I helped them with their homework, I even went to the grocery store with my wife and helped pick out their favorite meals.

I pulled my coffee mug out of the cabinet one morning and a peculiar thing happened. The mug, which had always read ""#1 Dad"" suddenly changed to ""#4 Dad.""

Apparently all of the #1 Dad mugs in the world have been randomly changing ranking to reflect the actual ranking of dads. So now I'm #4 Dad.

Apparently all of the #1 Dad mugs in the world have been randomly changing ranking to reflect the actual ranking of dads. So now I'm #4 Dad. I figured #4 is still really good so I wasn't too worried about it.

 I wondered why it had gone down. I called my dad and he said, ""I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted again.""

I played with my kids, I took them to the park, I helped them with their homework, I even went to the grocery store with my wife and helped pick out their favorite meals.
