""What do you me,"" the 92nd pig asked, puzzled.

""That's uranium.  It can kill you,"" the wolf said.

""How do you know?"" the 92nd pig asked.

The wolf explained that he studied chemistry in college.  He started to talk about radioactive elements and the 92nd pig invited him in for tea. ""Uhm"" the wolf said, ""that's not a good idea. I'm not going into your house, and you shouldn't either.  It's too dangerous.""

The pig didn't have anywhere else to go, so he packed a bag and followed the wolf.  They went into his den and the wolf turned on the television.  ""Sit down,"" he said to the pig.  Then the wolf went into the kitchen and came back with a tray full of snacks.  ""I thought you might be hungry,"" he said.

The little pig picked up a plate and loaded it with the goodies the wolf had laid out on the tray.  The two of them chatted and watched a football game together in the den.  Finally, as night fell, the 92nd pig asked the question that had been weighing heavily on his all day.  ""Frank,"" he said, ""are you going to eat me?""

The wolf looked at him and slowly started to laugh.  He laughed and laughed until tears rolled down his furry cheeks. No,"" the wolf said, ""I'm not going to eat you.
  I'm not going to eat anyone.""

""But you're a wolf,"" the pig said.

The wolf asked the pig what he had eating while they watched tv together.  The pig thought a minute and then said, ""let's see, we had peanuts, a fruit salad, a bowl of popcorn and stir fry with tofu for dinner.""  

""That's right.  Did you notice that these foods have anything in common?""

""What do you me,"" the 92nd pig asked, puzzled.

""That's uranium.  It can kill you,"" the wolf said.

""How do you know?"" the 92nd pig asked.

The wolf explained that he studied chemistry in college.  He started to talk about radioactive elements and the 92nd pig invited him in for tea. ""Uhm"" the wolf said, ""that's not a good idea. I'm not going into your house, and you shouldn't either.  It's too dangerous.""

The pig didn't have anywhere else to go, so he packed a bag and followed the wolf.  They went into his den and the wolf turned on the television.  ""Sit down,"" he said to the pig.  Then the wolf went into the kitchen and came back with a tray full of snacks.  ""I thought you might be hungry,"" he said.

The little pig picked up a plate and loaded it with the goodies the wolf had laid out on the tray.  The two of them chatted and watched a football game together in the den.  Finally, as night fell, the 92nd pig asked the question that had been weighing heavily on his all day.  ""Frank,"" he said, ""are you going to eat me?""

The wolf looked at him and slowly started to laugh.  He laughed and laughed until tears rolled down his furry cheeks. No,"" the wolf said, ""I'm not going to eat you.
  I'm not going to eat anyone.""

""But you're a wolf,"" the pig said.

The wolf asked the pig what he had eating while they watched tv together.  The pig thought a minute and then said, ""let's see, we had peanuts, a fruit salad, a bowl of popcorn and stir fry with tofu for dinner.""

""What do you me,"" the 92nd pig asked, puzzled.

""That's uranium.  It can kill you,"" the wolf said.

""How do you know?"" the 92nd pig asked.

The wolf explained that he studied chemistry in college.  He started to talk about radioactive elements and the 92nd pig invited him in for tea. ""Uhm"" the wolf said, ""that's not a good idea. I'm not going into your house, and you shouldn't either.  It's too dangerous.""

The 92nd little pig looked so pitiful standing there, the wolf introduced himself as Frank and invited him back to his place.  The pig didn't have anywhere else to go, so he packed a bag and followed the wolf.  They went into his den and the wolf turned on the television.  ""Sit down,"" he said to the pig.  Then the wolf went into the kitchen and came back with a tray full of snacks.  ""I thought you might be hungry,"" he said.

The little pig picked up a plate and loaded it with the goodies the wolf had laid out on the tray.  The two of them chatted and watched a football game together in the den.  Finally, as night fell, the 92nd pig asked the question that had been weighing heavily on his all day.  ""Frank,"" he said, ""are you going to eat me?""

The wolf looked at him and slowly started to laugh.  He laughed and laughed until tears rolled down his furry cheeks. No,"" the wolf said, ""I'm not going to eat you.
  I'm not going to eat anyone.""

""But you're a wolf,"" the pig said.

The wolf asked the pig what he had eating while they watched tv together.  The pig thought a minute and then said, ""let's see, we had peanuts, a fruit salad, a bowl of popcorn and stir fry with tofu for dinner.""  

""That's right.  Did you notice that these foods have anything in common?""

he pig thought a minute and then said, ""they're all made of plants.""


The wolf nodded.

""You're a vegetarian.  You don't eat meat.""

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" And the 92nd little pig was like, ""what?"" And the wolf was like, ""dude, that's not a good idea.""

""What do you me,"" the 92nd pig asked, puzzled.

""That's uranium.  It can kill you,"" the wolf said.

""How do you know?"" the 92nd pig asked.

The wolf explained that he studied chemistry in college.  He started to talk about radioactive elements and the 92nd pig invited him in for tea. ""Uhm"" the wolf said, ""that's not a good idea. I'm not going into your house, and you shouldn't either.  It's too dangerous.""

The pig didn't have anywhere else to go, so he packed a bag and followed the wolf.  They went into his den and the wolf turned on the television.  ""Sit down,"" he said to the pig.

The little pig picked up a plate and loaded it with the goodies the wolf had laid out on the tray.  The two of them chatted and watched a football game together in the den.  Finally, as night fell, the 92nd pig asked the question that had been weighing heavily on his all day.  ""Frank,"" he said, ""are you going to eat me?""

The wolf looked at him and slowly started to laugh.  He laughed and laughed until tears rolled down his furry cheeks. No,"" the wolf said, ""I'm not going to eat you.
  I'm not going to eat anyone.""

""But you're a wolf,"" the pig said.

The wolf asked the pig what he had eating while they watched tv together.  The pig thought a minute and then said, ""let's see, we had peanuts, a fruit salad, a bowl of popcorn and stir fry with tofu for dinner.""

The little pig picked up a plate and loaded it with the goodies the wolf had laid out on the tray.  The two of them chatted and watched a football game together in the den.

The wolf looked at him and slowly started to laugh.  He laughed and laughed until tears rolled down his furry cheeks. No,"" the wolf said, ""I'm not going to eat you.
  I'm not going to eat anyone.""

""But you're a wolf,"" the pig said.

The wolf asked the pig what he had eating while they watched tv together.  The pig thought a minute and then said, ""let's see, we had peanuts, a fruit salad, a bowl of popcorn and stir fry with tofu for dinner.""

The little pig picked up a plate and loaded it with the goodies the wolf had laid out on the tray.  The two of them chatted and watched a football game together in the den.  Finally, as night fell, the 92nd pig asked the question that had been weighing heavily on his all day.  ""Frank,"" he said, ""are you going to eat me?""

The wolf looked at him and slowly started to laugh.  He laughed and laughed until tears rolled down his furry cheeks. No,"" the wolf said, ""I'm not going to eat you.
  I'm not going to eat anyone.""

""But you're a wolf,"" the pig said.

The wolf asked the pig what he had eating while they watched tv together.  The pig thought a minute and then said, ""let's see, we had peanuts, a fruit salad, a bowl of popcorn and stir fry with tofu for dinner.""  

""That's right.  Did you notice that these foods have anything in common?""

he pig thought a minute and then said, ""they're all made of plants.""


The wolf nodded.

""You're a vegetarian.  You don't eat meat.""

""Correct,"" said the wolf.  ""Now, you need a place to stay and I can't pay the rent on this place myself, so how about it.  Do you want to be my roommate?""

""How do you know?"" the 92nd pig asked.

The wolf explained that he studied chemistry in college.  He started to talk about radioactive elements and the 92nd pig invited him in for tea. ""Uhm"" the wolf said, ""that's not a good idea. I'm not going into your house, and you shouldn't either.  It's too dangerous.""
