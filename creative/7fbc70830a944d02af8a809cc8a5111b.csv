 He tried using grenades, but they didn't even leave a mark. He tried to fire a missile, but it just bounced off the roof. So the wolf tried to drive a tank through the front door, but it got stuck in the doorway.

 He tried using grenades, but they didn't even leave a mark. He tried to fire a missile, but it just bounced off the roof. So the wolf tried to drive a tank through the front door, but it got stuck in the doorway.
