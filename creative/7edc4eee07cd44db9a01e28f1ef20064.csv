Where is this theater anyway, is it heaven or is it hell?  You are all here, so it must be one of those.

I wonder if these yous are good people or bad people?  Do we all share a common core personality?  Do we all have the same soul?  How many years of life does this represent for ""me""?  How many more lives are left?  Is this the last one?  Did I have something I was supposed to do? Is it now done?  Did I do it?  Did I do it right?

What if this is an endless process and next time one dies one ends up back here?  The movie I am watching of the next life do I watch until that you is extinguished and joins all of us here to watch yet another life unfold.  Will there never be enlightenme

Where is this theater anyway, is it heaven or is it hell?  You are all here, so it must be one of those.

I wonder if these yous are good people or bad people?  Do we all share a common core personality?  Do we all have the same soul?  How many years of life does this represent for ""me""?  How many more lives are left?  Is this the last one?  Did I have something I was supposed to do? Is it now done?  Did I do it?  Did I do it right?

What if this is an endless process and next time one dies one ends up back here?  The movie I am watching of the next life do I watch until that you is extinguished and joins all of us here to watch yet another life unfold.  Will there never be enlightenment?  Will my questions never be answered?
