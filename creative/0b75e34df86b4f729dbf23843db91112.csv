 Mr. President says JFK, we have been anxiously awaiting your arrival.

These dimensions are mostly identical with little differences here and there. For instance the USSR is the dominate superpower in about 23% of these alternate timelines/dimensions.

 Mr. President says JFK, we have been anxiously awaiting your arrival. You are the one that will finally merge all the realities into one and complete the quest for peace your predecessors have worked and are working so hard to achieve. You, Barack are the one, the one who will end the infinite war between good and evil. JFK takes a brief pause and says Barack, I know this may come as a shock to you but there are other dimensions. These dimensions are mostly identical with little differences here and there. For instance the USSR is the dominate superpower in about 23% of these alternate timelines/dimensions. We need you and your yet unrealized powers of the universe to fix what we have failed to do. Your coming was prophecized by the one they call Moto. He has laid the ground work.

These dimensions are mostly identical with little differences here and there. For instance the USSR is the dominate superpower in about 23% of these alternate timelines/dimensions. We need you and your yet unrealized powers of the universe to fix what we have failed to do. Your coming was foreseen by the one they call Moto. He has laid the ground work.

 Mr. President says JFK, we have been anxiously awaiting your arrival. You are the one that will finally merge all the realities into one and complete the quest for peace your predecessors have worked and are working so hard to achieve. You, Barack are the one, the one who will end the infinite war between good and evil. JFK takes a brief pause and says Barack, I know this may come as a shock to you but there are other dimensions. These dimensions are mostly identical with little differences here and there. For instance the USSR is the dominate superpower in about 23% of these alternate timelines/dimensions. We need you and your yet unrealized powers of the universe to fix what we have failed to do. Your coming was foreseen by the one they call Moto. He has laid the ground work and you must complete it now that he is no longer with us.

 Mr. President says JFK, we have been anxiously awaiting your arrival. You are the one that will finally merge all the realities into one and complete the quest for peace your predecessors have worked and are working so hard to achieve. You, Barack are the one, the one who will end the infinite war between good and evil. JFK takes a brief pause and says Barack, I know this may come as a shock to you but there are other dimensions. These dimensions are mostly identical with little differences here and there. For instance the USSR is the dominate superpower in about 23% of these alternate timelines/dimensions. We need you and your yet unrealized powers of the universe to fix what we have failed to do. Your coming was foreseen by the one they call Moto. He has laid the ground work and you must complete it now that he is no longer with us.

 Mr. President says JFK, we have been anxiously awaiting your arrival. You are the one that will finally merge all the realities into one and complete the quest for peace your predecessors have worked and are working so hard to achieve. You, Barack are the one, the one who will end the infinite war between good and evil. JFK takes a brief pause and says Barack, I know this may come as a shock to you but there are other dimensions. These dimensions are mostly identical with little differences here and there. For instance the USSR is the dominate superpower in about 23% of these alternate timelines/dimensions. We need you and your yet unrealized powers of the universe to fix what we have failed to do. Your coming was foreseen by the one they call Moto. He has laid the ground work and you must complete it now that he is no longer with us.

 Mr. President says JFK, we have been anxiously awaiting your arrival.

You, Barack are the one, the one who will end the infinite war between good and evil. JFK takes a brief pause and says Barack, I know this may come as a shock to you but there are other dimensions. These dimensions are mostly identical with little differences here and there. For instance the USSR is the dominate superpower in about 23% of these alternate timelines/dimensions. We need you and your yet unrealized powers of the universe to fix what we have failed to do. Your coming was foreseen by the one they call Moto.

 Mr. President says JFK, we have been anxiously awaiting your arrival. You are the one that will finally merge all the realities into one and complete the quest for peace your predecessors have worked and are working so hard to achieve.

These dimensions are mostly identical with little differences here and there. For instance the USSR is the dominate superpower in about 23% of these alternate timelines/dimensions. We need you and your yet unrealized powers of the universe to fix what we have failed to do. Your coming was foreseen by the one they call Moto. He has laid the ground work and you must complete it now that he is no longer with us.
