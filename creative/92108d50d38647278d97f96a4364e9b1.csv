I almost spat the bee right there because I was so scared of it having the capability to talk. I examined the bee. I realized it wasn't possible for it to talk. I examined it further, almost close to my eye I see that it has robotic parts. This bee is not a living creature. It's a robot!

""Who made you?"" I asked the bee robot. ""Why are you here?""
""I am the Bee Robot.
 I am here to answer and serve you."" said the bee robot.

Not convinced, I tried to look for any off switch. I finally found the off switch and pressed it. I took it back home and studied it, carefully hiding it from my mother who said I was allergic to bees. Maybe she knows something, maybe she's doing this to protect me. 

But I went on to my room and studied the small bee. I gotten a magnifying glass and printed to the back of the bee says, ""Copyright 2011, Bee Robot Inc.""

""Bee Robot, Inc.?"" I murmured. I also noticed those bolded initials. BRI. Those were the initials of my dad. I decided to confront my mom about it.

I almost spat the bee right there because I was so scared of it having the capability to talk. I examined the bee. I realized it wasn't possible for it to talk. I examined it further, almost close to my eye I see that it has robotic parts. This bee is not a living creature. It's a robot!

""Who made you?"" I asked the bee robot. ""Why are you here?""
""I am the Bee Robot.
 I am here to answer and serve you."" said the bee robot.

Not convinced, I tried to look for any off switch. I finally found the off switch and pressed it. I took it back home and studied it, carefully hiding it from my mother who said I was allergic to bees. Maybe she knows something, maybe she's doing this to protect me. 

But I went on to my room and studied the small bee. I gotten a magnifying glass and printed to the back of the bee says, ""Copyright 2011, Bee Robot Inc.""

""Bee Robot, Inc.?"" I murmured. I also noticed those bolded initials. BRI. Those were the initials of my dad. I decided to confront my mom about it.

""He built the company to protect you, honey."" Mom said. ""Originally, that was the plan.""

 I am here to answer and serve you."" said the bee robot.

I almost spat the bee right there because I was so scared of it having the capability to talk. I examined the bee. I realized it wasn't possible for it to talk. I examined it further, almost close to my eye I see that it has robotic parts. This bee is not a living creature. It's a robot!

""I am the Bee Robot.
 I am here to answer and serve you."" said the bee robot.

But I went on to my room and studied the small bee. I gotten a magnifying glass and printed to the back of the bee says, ""Copyright 2011, Bee Robot Inc.""

""Bee Robot, Inc.?"" I murmured. I also noticed those bolded initials. BRI. Those were the initials of my dad. I decided to confront my mom about it.

""He built the company to protect you, honey."" Mom said. ""Originally, that was the plan.""

But not all plans go smoothly, I suppose. She explained that my dad died creating the company as the bees have now gone autonomous and learn among themselves. It was created to protect me, but now it has gone on a rampage against all the people I know, my friends and family. That's why we were always moving. That's why we were always told to not touch them. That's why I always see people being killed by bees in the news.

I almost spat the bee right there because I was so scared of it having the capability to talk. I examined the bee. I realized it wasn't possible for it to talk. I examined it further, almost close to my eye I see that it has robotic parts. This bee is not a living creature. It's a robot!

""I am the Bee Robot.
 I am here to answer and serve you."" said the bee robot.

""Bee Robot, Inc.?"" I murmured. I also noticed those bolded initials. BRI. Those were the initials of my dad. I decided to confront my mom about it.

""He built the company to protect you, honey."" Mom said. ""Originally, that was the plan.""

But not all plans go smoothly, I suppose. She explained that my dad died creating the company as the bees have now gone autonomous and learn among themselves. It was created to protect me, but now it has gone on a rampage against all the people I know, my friends and family. That's why we were always moving. That's why we were always told to not touch them. That's why I always see people being killed by bees in the news.

But I went on to my room and studied the small bee. I gotten a magnifying glass and printed to the back of the bee says, ""Copyright 2011, Bee Robot Inc.""

""Bee Robot, Inc.?"" I murmured. I also noticed those bolded initials. BRI. Those were the initials of my dad. I decided to confront my mom about it.

""He built the company to protect you, honey."" Mom said. ""Originally, that was the plan.""

But not all plans go smoothly, I suppose. She explained that my dad died creating the company as the bees have now gone autonomous and learn among themselves. It was created to protect me, but now it has gone on a rampage against all the people I know, my friends and family. That's why we were always moving. That's why we were always told to not touch them. That's why I always see people being killed by bees in the news.
