Canada had stayed out of the war and stayed neutral throughout it even though it was constantly cajoled by France and Spain to join the war. Canada's leaders ignored the calls but it turned out that keeping quiet wasn't enough to keep them out of this war. Because they stayed out, they also were enjoying an era of prosperity.
