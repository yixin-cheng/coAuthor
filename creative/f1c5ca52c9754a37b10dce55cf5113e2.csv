As you made your way down the hall of the castle, you spotted the pest control person. You stopped him and asked when he planned to get rid of the bee hive outside the castle gates.
He looks at you with great confusion and says ""I don't know what you're talking about. We don't plan on getting rid of it, bees are needed to keep our flowers blooming so we want to keep it there."" and he walks away.

As you get back to your room, the bee is waiting and reports of no such plans. You tell him, all bees outside the gates are safe. You turn back into a bee, and fly home.",1686,[],0,3,5,30,0.3,1,0,0,1459
