The humans decided to use their reawakened energy to fight, and take back what was once theirs, Earth. The aliens had advanced technology, but humans had advanced magic.  
The humans were able to use their magic to create weapons, and armor, and even to create a shield around the Earth.
 The weapons they created were of magical nature that the aliens could not deflect with their shields. The humans were able to destroy the alien ships and they were able to drive them away from Earth. But they knew more aliens would come, that's why they had to create a shield around Earth. 
The shield was created from the human's own magic, and it was powered by the mana of the humans.
 They had to use magic stones to hold the power of their mana so they could make sure  the shield always stayed up and did not have to channel it all day and night.

The humans decided to use their reawakened energy to fight, and take back what was once theirs, Earth. The aliens had advanced technology, but humans had advanced magic.  
The humans were able to use their magic to create weapons, and armor, and even to create a shield around the Earth.
 The weapons they created were of magical nature that the aliens could not deflect with their shields. The humans were able to destroy the alien ships and they were able to drive them away from Earth. But they knew more aliens would come, that's why they had to create a shield around Earth. 
The shield was created from the human's own magic, and it was powered by the mana of the humans.
 They had to use magic stones to hold the power of their mana so they could make sure  the shield always stayed up and did not have to channel it all day and night. 

Sure enough, the aliens came back, but they could not get through the shield no matter how hard they tried, so the aliens set up a border around Earth to wait for the day the shield might fall so they could make their strike against the humans.

The human knew this so they had to prepare another weapon using their mana to get rid of the aliens once and for all. It really wasn't a weapon to fight though. It was a great spell of teleporting. So the humans gathered one day and channeled all their mana together, and teleported Earth to a far far away galaxy close to a new sun.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.

This power that humans used to have came from a spiritual energy they held deep inside their souls, called mana. They could use it for many things good or bad, healing or hurting others.

The humans decided to use their reawakened energy to fight, and take back what was once theirs, Earth. The aliens had advanced technology, but humans had advanced magic.  
The humans were able to use their magic to create weapons, and armor, and even to create a shield around the Earth.
 The weapons they created were of magical nature that the aliens could not deflect with their shields. The humans were able to destroy the alien ships and they were able to drive them away from Earth. But they knew more aliens would come, that's why they had to create a shield around Earth. 
The shield was created from the human's own magic, and it was powered by the mana of the humans.
 They had to use magic stones to hold the power of their mana so they could make sure  the shield always stayed up and did not have to channel it all day and night. 

Sure enough, the aliens came back, but they could not get through the shield no matter how hard they tried, so the aliens set up a border around Earth to wait for the day the shield might fall so they could make their strike against the humans.

The human knew this so they had to prepare another weapon using their mana to get rid of the aliens once and for all. It really wasn't a weapon to fight though. It was a great spell of teleporting. So the humans gathered one day and channeled all their mana together, and teleported Earth to a far far away galaxy close to a new sun.

But with over 7 billion of us on the planet now, Mana has spread far too thinly to have any effect. When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.

This power that humans used to have came from a spiritual energy they held deep inside their souls, called mana. They could use it for many things good or bad, healing or hurting others.

The humans decided to use their reawakened energy to fight, and take back what was once theirs, Earth. The aliens had advanced technology, but humans had advanced magic.  
The humans were able to use their magic to create weapons, and armor, and even to create a shield around the Earth.
 The weapons they created were of magical nature that the aliens could not deflect with their shields. The humans were able to destroy the alien ships and they were able to drive them away from Earth. But they knew more aliens would come, that's why they had to create a shield around Earth. 
The shield was created from the human's own magic, and it was powered by the mana of the humans.
 They had to use magic stones to hold the power of their mana so they could make sure  the shield always stayed up and did not have to channel it all day and night. 

Sure enough, the aliens came back, but they could not get through the shield no matter how hard they tried, so the aliens set up a border around Earth to wait for the day the shield might fall so they could make their strike against the humans.

The human knew this so they had to prepare another weapon using their mana to get rid of the aliens once and for all. It really wasn't a weapon to fight though. It was a great spell of teleporting. So the humans gathered one day and channeled all their mana together, and teleported Earth to a far far away galaxy close to a new sun.
