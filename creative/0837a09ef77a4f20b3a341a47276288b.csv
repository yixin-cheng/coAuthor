The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" that is the best idea I have ever seen.

Then next morning the little pig awoke to the wolf sneaking around outside. He was setting up tall metal rods around the pigs home. Since the pig was so sure of his houses strength that he did not worry and went about his morning as normal. Around lunch time the little pig started to notice that the house was heating up. He then looked outside but saw nothing except the rods positioned evenly around his home. They did not seem to be active in any way so he turned up the AC and made some lunch.
After lunch the little pig noticed that the house was getting hotter and hotter.
 It was becoming unbearable. Finally the little pig yelled out the window and told the wolf to stop whatever it was that he was doing to heat the house but the wolf was relaxing by the lake far from the the piggy's home. After a few more minutes the pig was forced to go outside to get some fresh air. He looked around but the fox was nowhere to be seen.

Then next morning the little pig awoke to the wolf sneaking around outside. He was setting up tall metal rods around the pigs home. Since the pig was so sure of his houses strength that he did not worry and went about his morning as normal. Around lunch time the little pig started to notice that the house was heating up. He then looked outside but saw nothing except the rods positioned evenly around his home. They did not seem to be active in any way so he turned up the AC and made some lunch.

Finally the little pig yelled out the window and told the wolf to stop whatever it was that he was doing to heat the house but the wolf was relaxing by the lake far from the the piggy's home. After a few more minutes the pig was forced to go outside to get some fresh air. He looked around but the fox was nowhere to be seen. He walked around the house and noticed that the metal rods were now glowing red hot.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" that is the best idea I have ever seen. The little pig then replied ""thank you"" from safely inside the house. The wolf then said ""I'm going to blow your house down."" and the little pig said ""okay.""

Then next morning the little pig awoke to the wolf sneaking around outside. He was setting up tall metal rods around the pigs home. Since the pig was so sure of his houses strength that he did not worry and went about his morning as normal. Around lunch time the little pig started to notice that the house was heating up. He then looked outside but saw nothing except the rods positioned evenly around his home. They did not seem to be active in any way so he turned up the AC and made some lunch.
After lunch the little pig noticed that the house was getting hotter and hotter.
 It was becoming unbearable. Finally the little pig yelled out the window and told the wolf to stop whatever it was that he was doing to heat the house but the wolf was relaxing by the lake far from the the piggy's home. After a few more minutes the pig was forced to go outside to get some fresh air. He looked around but the fox was nowhere to be seen. He walked around the house and noticed that the metal rods were now glowing red hot.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" that is the best idea I have ever seen.

Then next morning the little pig awoke to the wolf sneaking around outside. He was setting up tall metal rods around the pigs home.

He then looked outside but saw nothing except the rods positioned evenly around his home. They did not seem to be active in any way so he turned up the AC and made some lunch.
After lunch the little pig noticed that the house was getting hotter and hotter.
 It was becoming unbearable. Finally the little pig yelled out the window and told the wolf to stop whatever it was that he was doing to heat the house but the wolf was relaxing by the lake far from the the piggy's home.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" that is the best idea I have ever seen.

Then next morning the little pig awoke to the wolf sneaking around outside. He was setting up tall metal rods around the pigs home.

He then looked outside but saw nothing except the rods positioned evenly around his home. They did not seem to be active in any way so he turned up the AC and made some lunch.
After lunch the little pig noticed that the house was getting hotter and hotter.
 It was becoming unbearable. Finally the little pig yelled out the window and told the wolf to stop whatever it was that he was doing to heat the house but the wolf was relaxing by the lake far from the the piggy's home.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" that is the best idea I have ever seen.

Then next morning the little pig awoke to the wolf sneaking around outside. He was setting up tall metal rods around the pigs home.

He then looked outside but saw nothing except the rods positioned evenly around his home. They did not seem to be active in any way so he turned up the AC and made some lunch.
After lunch the little pig noticed that the house was getting hotter and hotter.
 It was becoming unbearable.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" that is the best idea I have ever seen. The little pig then replied ""thank you"" from safely inside the house. The wolf then said ""I'm going to blow your house down."" and the little pig said ""okay.""

Then next morning the little pig awoke to the wolf sneaking around outside. He was setting up tall metal rods around the pigs home. Since the pig was so sure of his houses strength that he did not worry and went about his morning as normal. Around lunch time the little pig started to notice that the house was heating up. He then looked outside but saw nothing except the rods positioned evenly around his home. They did not seem to be active in any way so he turned up the AC and made some lunch.
After lunch the little pig noticed that the house was getting hotter and hotter.
 It was becoming unbearable. Finally the little pig yelled out the window and told the wolf to stop whatever it was that he was doing to heat the house but the wolf was relaxing by the lake far from the the piggy's home. After a few more minutes the pig was forced to go outside to get some fresh air. He looked around but the fox was nowhere to be seen. He walked around the house and noticed that the metal rods were now glowing red hot. He did not understand their purpose and they were too hot to handle so he yelled to the fox; ""please come fix my home""!

The fox heard the pig's cry and rushed back over and snatched up the little pig before it had time to move and ate him up.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" that is the best idea I have ever seen. The little pig then replied ""thank you"" from safely inside the house. The wolf then said ""I'm going to blow your house down."" and the little pig said ""okay."" Both the big and wolf knew this was impossible so they both ignored the threat and went about their day. 
Then next morning the little pig awoke to the wolf sneaking around outside. He was setting up tall metal rods around the pigs home. Since the pig was so sure of his houses strength that he did not worry and went about his morning as normal. Around lunch time the little pig started to notice that the house was heating up. He then looked outside but saw nothing except the rods positioned evenly around his home. They did not seem to be active in any way so he turned up the AC and made some lunch.
After lunch the little pig noticed that the house was getting hotter and hotter.
 It was becoming unbearable. Finally the little pig yelled out the window and told the wolf to stop whatever it was that he was doing to heat the house but the wolf was relaxing by the lake far from the the piggy's home. After a few more minutes the pig was forced to go outside to get some fresh air. He looked around but the fox was nowhere to be seen. He walked around the house and noticed that the metal rods were now glowing red hot. He did not understand their purpose and they were too hot to handle so he yelled to the fox; ""please come fix my home""!

The fox heard the pig's cry and rushed back over and snatched up the little pig before it had time to move and ate him up. It turned out the fox was a scientist and he turned the home into a large centerfuge and started converting the uranium 238 int 235 which then heated up the house enough to force the pig outside. It was a lot of effort for a small meal but the wolf did ",2207,[],2,2,5,30,0.3,1,0,0,1997

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" that is the best idea I have ever seen. The little pig then replied ""thank you"" from safely inside the house. The wolf then said ""I'm going to blow your house down."" and the little pig said ""okay."" Both the big and wolf knew this was impossible so they both ignored the threat and went about their day. 
Then next morning the little pig awoke to the wolf sneaking around outside. He was setting up tall metal rods around the pigs home. Since the pig was so sure of his houses strength that he did not worry and went about his morning as normal. Around lunch time the little pig started to notice that the house was heating up. He then looked outside but saw nothing except the rods positioned evenly around his home. They did not seem to be active in any way so he turned up the AC and made some lunch.
After lunch the little pig noticed that the house was getting hotter and hotter.
 It was becoming unbearable. Finally the little pig yelled out the window and told the wolf to stop whatever it was that he was doing to heat the house but the wolf was relaxing by the lake far from the the piggy's home. After a few more minutes the pig was forced to go outside to get some fresh air. He looked around but the fox was nowhere to be seen. He walked around the house and noticed that the metal rods were now glowing red hot. He did not understand their purpose and they were too hot to handle so he yelled to the fox; ""please come fix my home""!

The fox heard the pig's cry and rushed back over and snatched up the little pig before it had time to move and ate him up.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" that is the best idea I have ever seen. The little pig then replied ""thank you"" from safely inside the house. The wolf then said ""I'm going to blow your house down."" and the little pig said ""okay."" Both the big and wolf knew this was impossible so they both ignored the threat and went about their day. 
Then next morning the little pig awoke to the wolf sneaking around outside. He was setting up tall metal rods around the pigs home. Since the pig was so sure of his houses strength that he did not worry and went about his morning as normal. Around lunch time the little pig started to notice that the house was heating up. He then looked outside but saw nothing except the rods positioned evenly around his home. They did not seem to be active in any way so he turned up the AC and made some lunch.
After lunch the little pig noticed that the house was getting hotter and hotter.
 It was becoming unbearable. Finally the little pig yelled out the window and told the wolf to stop whatever it was that he was doing to heat the house but the wolf was relaxing by the lake far from the the piggy's home. After a few more minutes the pig was forced to go outside to get some fresh air. He looked around but the fox was nowhere to be seen. He walked around the house and noticed that the metal rods were now glowing red hot. He did not understand their purpose and they were too hot to handle so he yelled to the fox; ""please come fix my home""!

The fox heard the pig's cry and rushed back over and snatched up the little pig before it had time to move and ate him up.

The little pig then replied ""thank you"" from safely inside the house. The wolf then said ""I'm going to blow your house down."" and the little pig said ""okay."" Both the big and wolf knew this was impossible so they both ignored the threat and went about their day. 
Then next morning the little pig awoke to the wolf sneaking around outside. He was setting up tall metal rods around the pigs home. Since the pig was so sure of his houses strength that he did not worry and went about his morning as normal. Around lunch time the little pig started to notice that the house was heating up. He then looked outside but saw nothing except the rods positioned evenly around his home. They did not seem to be active in any way so he turned up the AC and made some lunch.
After lunch the little pig noticed that the house was getting hotter and hotter.
 It was becoming unbearable. Finally the little pig yelled out the window and told the wolf to stop whatever it was that he was doing to heat the house but the wolf was relaxing by the lake far from the the piggy's home. After a few more minutes the pig was forced to go outside to get some fresh air. He looked around but the fox was nowhere to be seen. He walked around the house and noticed that the metal rods were now glowing red hot. He did not understand their purpose and they were too hot to handle so he yelled to the fox; ""please come fix my home""!

The fox heard the pig's cry and rushed back over and snatched up the little pig before it had time to move and ate him up. It turned out the fox was a scientist and he turned the home into a large centerfuge and started converting the uranium 238 int 235 which then heated up the house enough to force the pig outside.

After lunch the little pig noticed that the house was getting hotter and hotter.

After lunch the little pig noticed that the house was getting hotter and hotter.
 It was becoming unbearable. Finally the little pig yelled out the window and told the wolf to stop whatever it was that he was doing to heat the house but the wolf was relaxing by the lake far from the the piggy's home. After a few more minutes the pig was forced to go outside to get some fresh air. He looked around but the fox was nowhere to be seen. He walked around the house and noticed that the metal rods were now glowing red hot. He did not understand their purpose and they were too hot to handle so he yelled to the fox; ""please come fix my home""!

The fox heard the pig's cry and rushed back over and snatched up the little pig before it had time to move and ate him up. It turned out the fox was a scientist and he turned the home into a large centrifuge and started converting the uranium 238 int 235 which then heated up the house enough to force the pig outside. The wolf was both satisfied with its meal and its ingenuity. ",2038,[],2,2,5,30,0.3,1,0,0,2160
