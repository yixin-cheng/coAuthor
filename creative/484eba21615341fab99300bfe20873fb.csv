The humans had planned to create a clone of Matt Damon and let the aliens believe they had taken the clone, when in reality they will have taken away the real Matt Damon. The aliens learned about this clone, but did not know the clone was on Earth. So the aliens, who wanted the real Matt Damon , sent out two of their best space ships to Earth in hopes of snatching the clone (who they didn't know was a clone), and replace him with the real Matt Damon (who they did know was the real Matt Damon). 
The humans knew the aliens would try to take the clone, so they developed a plan in which they would hide him inside a building and let
 the aliens believe that they were trying to protect him, when in fact they were not. So the aliens showed up with their ships, and in a covert mission swapped the two Matt Damons.
