Matt Damon has been gone for 3 years now. His wife, Luciana Damon, is almost ready to move on with another man. In fact, after last week's briefing with the military, Luciana is seen with Mr. Vaughn, one of the five special candidates hand picked by the military to be a replacement husband. They were seen holding hands that day. Even if Matt Damon's disappearance and the known culprit being the aliens, the media and social media influencers are more interested with the new couple. 

On Wednesday, a famous TikToker with the name of kitty_nator, after seeing the couple, commented: ""Luciana's new man is literally as hot as Matt Damon. Probably as hot when Matt Damon is in his early 20's. I dig it."" Mr. Vaughn, a 24 year old man from Richmond, Virginia, is a very handsome man. He met Luciana Damon a year after Matt Damon was kidnapped. Luciana said that Mr. Vaughn was very kind to her and helped her cope with Matt's absence. ""Mr. Vaughn was very supportive when Matt went missing. And he's also very handsome."" said Luciana in an interview.

But not all is good and bright with this Mr. Vaughn person. Little is known about his past and his parents are also not in the picture. ""Where did he come from?

Matt Damon has been gone for 3 years now. His wife, Luciana Damon, is almost ready to move on with another man. In fact, after last week's briefing with the military, Luciana is seen with Mr. Vaughn, one of the five special candidates hand picked by the military to be a replacement husband. They were seen holding hands that day. Even if Matt Damon's disappearance and the known culprit being the aliens, the media and social media influencers are more interested with the new couple. 

On Wednesday, a famous TikToker with the name of kitty_nator, after seeing the couple, commented: ""Luciana's new man is literally as hot as Matt Damon. Probably as hot when Matt Damon is in his early 20's. I dig it."" Mr. Vaughn, a 24 year old man from Richmond, Virginia, is a very handsome man. He met Luciana Damon a year after Matt Damon was kidnapped. Luciana said that Mr. Vaughn was very kind to her and helped her cope with Matt's absence. ""Mr. Vaughn was very supportive when Matt went missing. And he's also very handsome."" said Luciana in an interview.

But not all is good and bright with this Mr. Vaughn person. Little is known about his past and his parents are also not in the picture. ""Where did he come from? I mean, his parents are nowhere to be found."" said K. Parker, a social media influencer with over 100K followers. A conspiracy theorist YouTuber with the name of the_real_truthdog said that there are many things about Mr. Vaughn that cannot be explained: ""I did a quick research about this man and found almost completely nothing."" He later added, ""There's a 99% chance that Mr. Vaughn is an alien."" 

News reports of Mr. Vaughns blinking was also put into question. ""Sure, he's handsome, but look at the way he blinks. It's almost as if he has an extra eyelid."" said K.

They were seen holding hands that day. Even if Matt Damon's disappearance and the known culprit being the aliens, the media and social media influencers are more interested with the new couple. 

On Wednesday, a famous TikToker with the name of kitty_nator, after seeing the couple, commented: ""Luciana's new man is literally as hot as Matt Damon. Probably as hot when Matt Damon is in his early 20's. I dig it."" Mr. Vaughn, a 24 year old man from Richmond, Virginia, is a very handsome man. He met Luciana Damon a year after Matt Damon was kidnapped. Luciana said that Mr. Vaughn was very kind to her and helped her cope with Matt's absence. ""Mr. Vaughn was very supportive when Matt went missing. And he's also very handsome."" said Luciana in an interview.

But not all is good and bright with this Mr. Vaughn person. Little is known about his past and his parents are also not in the picture. ""Where did he come from? I mean, his parents are nowhere to be found."" said K. Parker, a social media influencer with over 100K followers. A conspiracy theorist YouTuber with the name of the_real_truthdog said that there are many things about Mr. Vaughn that cannot be explained: ""I did a quick research about this man and found almost completely nothing."" He later added, ""There's a 99% chance that Mr. Vaughn is an alien."" 

News reports of Mr. Vaughns blinking was also put into question. ""Sure, he's handsome, but look at the way he blinks. It's almost as if he has an extra eyelid."" said K. Parker in a YouTube video, which was later removed after being flagged by the government and deemed as ""fake news"". As reporters grilled Mr. Vaughn about this, he just simply rejected the fact and mentioned that he doesn't have any extra eyelid. ""It's all a glitch in the video.""

Matt Damon has been gone for 3 years now. His wife, Luciana Damon, is almost ready to move on with another man. In fact, after last week's briefing with the military, Luciana is seen with Mr. Vaughn, one of the five special candidates hand picked by the military to be a replacement husband. They were seen holding hands that day. Even if Matt Damon's disappearance and the known culprit being the aliens, the media and social media influencers are more interested with the new couple. 

On Wednesday, a famous TikToker with the name of kitty_nator, after seeing the couple, commented: ""Luciana's new man is literally as hot as Matt Damon. Probably as hot when Matt Damon is in his early 20's. I dig it."" Mr. Vaughn, a 24 year old man from Richmond, Virginia, is a very handsome man. He met Luciana Damon a year after Matt Damon was kidnapped. Luciana said that Mr. Vaughn was very kind to her and helped her cope with Matt's absence. ""Mr. Vaughn was very supportive when Matt went missing. And he's also very handsome."" said Luciana in an interview.

But not all is good and bright with this Mr. Vaughn person. Little is known about his past and his parents are also not in the picture. ""Where did he come from? I mean, his parents are nowhere to be found."" said K. Parker, a social media influencer with over 100K followers. A conspiracy theorist YouTuber with the name of the_real_truthdog said that there are many things about Mr. Vaughn that cannot be explained: ""I did a quick research about this man and found almost completely nothing."" He later added, ""There's a 99% chance that Mr. Vaughn is an alien."" 

News reports of Mr. Vaughns blinking was also put into question. ""Sure, he's handsome, but look at the way he blinks. It's almost as if he has an extra eyelid."" said K. Parker in a YouTube video, which was later removed after being flagged by the government and deemed as ""fake news"". As reporters grilled Mr. Vaughn about this, he just simply rejected the fact and mentioned that he doesn't have any extra eyelid. ""It's all a glitch in the video.""

Matt Damon has been gone for 3 years now. His wife, Luciana Damon, is almost ready to move on with another man. In fact, after last week's briefing with the military, Luciana is seen with Mr. Vaughn, one of the five special candidates hand picked by the military to be a replacement husband. They were seen holding hands that day. Even if Matt Damon's disappearance and the known culprit being the aliens, the media and social media influencers are more interested with the new couple. 

On Wednesday, a famous TikToker with the name of kitty_nator, after seeing the couple, commented: ""Luciana's new man is literally as hot as Matt Damon. Probably as hot when Matt Damon is in his early 20's. I dig it."" Mr. Vaughn, a 24 year old man from Richmond, Virginia, is a very handsome man. He met Luciana Damon a year after Matt Damon was kidnapped. Luciana said that Mr. Vaughn was very kind to her and helped her cope with Matt's absence. ""Mr. Vaughn was very supportive when Matt went missing. And he's also very handsome."" said Luciana in an interview.

But not all is good and bright with this Mr. Vaughn person. Little is known about his past and his parents are also not in the picture. ""Where did he come from? I mean, his parents are nowhere to be found."" said K. Parker, a social media influencer with over 100K followers. A conspiracy theorist YouTuber with the name of the_real_truthdog said that there are many things about Mr. Vaughn that cannot be explained: ""I did a quick research about this man and found almost completely nothing."" He later added, ""There's a 99% chance that Mr. Vaughn is an alien."" 

News reports of Mr. Vaughns blinking was also put into question. ""Sure, he's handsome, but look at the way he blinks. It's almost as if he has an extra eyelid."" said K. Parker in a YouTube video, which was later removed after being flagged by the government and deemed as ""fake news"". As reporters grilled Mr. Vaughn about this, he just simply rejected the fact and mentioned that he doesn't have any extra eyelid. ""It's all a glitch in the video.""
