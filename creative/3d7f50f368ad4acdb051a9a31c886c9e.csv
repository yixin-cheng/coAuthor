""It's okay,"" said the bee. ""I just need one big favor from you.""The bee then told me that he had a wife and children at home and that soon, they would all starve because their crops have failed.

I immediately ran around in a panic because I was so scared of being stung by the bee. I know it can be life-threatening to some people, but as anaphylactic shock is a bit out of my comfort zone. ""But wait!,"" yelled the bee. ""I won't sting you, I have chosen you to be the queen!"" 
""But I have no idea how to be a queen,"" I said. 
""It's okay,"" said the bee. ""I just need one big favor from you.""The bee then told me that he had a wife and children at home and that soon, they would all starve because their crops have failed.
 This made no sense to me since I thought bees lived in hives and they don't grow vegetables. ""I'm one of the new independent bees,"" he told me. ""We live on our own with no hive and grow our food."" 
""Well, that is very impressive,"" I said. ""But why do you ask me to be your queen?"" And the bee told me that the independent bees need one thing from a queen, and that is for her to water their vegetables. ""Well I think I can do that! As long as you don't sting me."" And the bee promised not to sting me if I helped him and his family water their crops. So I followed the bee and his family out to their tiny farm and started watering their crops.

""But I have no idea how to be a queen,"" I said. 
""It's okay,"" said the bee. ""I just need one big favor from you.""The bee then told me that he had a wife and children at home and that soon, they would all starve because their crops have failed.
 This made no sense to me since I thought bees lived in hives and they don't grow vegetables. ""I'm one of the new independent bees,"" he told me. ""We live on our own with no hive and grow our food."" 
""Well, that is very impressive,"" I said. ""But why do you ask me to be your queen?"" And the bee told me that the independent bees need one thing from a queen, and that is for her to water their vegetables. ""Well I think I can do that! As long as you don't sting me."" And the bee promised not to sting me if I helped him and his family water their crops. So I followed the bee and his family out to their tiny farm and started watering their crops.

I immediately ran around in a panic because I was so scared of being stung by the bee. I know it can be life-threatening to some people, but as anaphylactic shock is a bit out of my comfort zone. ""But wait!,"" yelled the bee. ""I won't sting you, I have chosen you to be the queen!"" 
""But I have no idea how to be a queen,"" I said. 
""It's okay,"" said the bee. ""I just need one big favor from you.""The bee then told me that he had a wife and children at home and that soon, they would all starve because their crops have failed.
 This made no sense to me since I thought bees lived in hives and they don't grow vegetables. ""I'm one of the new independent bees,"" he told me. ""We live on our own with no hive and grow our food."" 
""Well, that is very impressive,"" I said. ""But why do you ask me to be your queen?"" And the bee told me that the independent bees need one thing from a queen, and that is for her to water their vegetables. ""Well I think I can do that! As long as you don't sting me."" And the bee promised not to sting me if I helped him and his family water their crops. So I followed the bee and his family out to their tiny farm and started watering their crops. Before long, the vegetables grew ripe and the bee family was able to thrive.In return for helping the bee family, the bee promised that if I was ever stung by a bee,  he would bring me a magic antidote that would immediately cure me of the sting. I considered this a worthy trade and from then on the bee and I were friends. I would be safe from stings as long as I watered their crops from then on.",1842,[],4,4,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,1516
