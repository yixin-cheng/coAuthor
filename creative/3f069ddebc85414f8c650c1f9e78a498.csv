The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""

""That's a really cool house you have there, piggy."" said the wolf in astonishment. The 92nd little pig was expecting the wolf. She has prepared almost her entire life that lead up to this moment. She didn't want to end up like those of her brothers and sisters that had been eaten by the wolf.

The pig said, ""I know what you're thinking, but you can't come in. This house is built with depleted uranium. You will die trying.""

The big bad wolf has taken the challenge. After punching the doors of the house to enter, he wasn't able to penetrate, not even a mere scratch. For days, the wolf tried to break into the house, but he was no match for the pig's house. 

""Are you done?"" said the 92nd little pig to the wolf.

""I will find a way to break your house and eat you!"" said the wolf. ""I will not give up!""

The big bad wolf gave up the next day. The 92nd little pig found her opportunity to avenge her brothers and sisters. She said, ""You see, you can't break my house. Now, it's my turn.""

The 92nd little pig has activated a button that revealed a trapdoor underneath the wolf. The wolf fell down to his death as he got eaten by a bunch of sharks underneath the house. The little pig grinned saying, ""I told you that you can't break my house.""

""That's a really cool house you have there, piggy."" said the wolf in astonishment. The 92nd little pig was expecting the wolf. She has prepared almost her entire life that lead up to this moment. She didn't want to end up like those of her brothers and sisters that had been eaten by the wolf.

The pig said, ""I know what you're thinking, but you can't come in. This house is built with depleted uranium. You will die trying.""

The big bad wolf has taken the challenge. After punching the doors of the house to enter, he wasn't able to penetrate, not even a mere scratch. For days, the wolf tried to break into the house, but he was no match for the pig's house. 

""Are you done?"" said the 92nd little pig to the wolf.

""I will find a way to break your house and eat you!"" said the wolf. ""I will not give up!""

The big bad wolf gave up the next day. The 92nd little pig found her opportunity to avenge her brothers and sisters. She said, ""You see, you can't break my house. Now, it's my turn.""

The 92nd little pig has activated a button that revealed a trapdoor underneath the wolf. The wolf fell down to his death as he got eaten by a bunch of sharks underneath the house. The little pig grinned saying, ""I told you that you can't break my house.""

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""

""That's a really cool house you have there, piggy."" said the wolf in astonishment. The 92nd little pig was expecting the wolf. She has prepared almost her entire life that lead up to this moment. She didn't want to end up like those of her brothers and sisters that had been eaten by the wolf.

The pig said, ""I know what you're thinking, but you can't come in. This house is built with depleted uranium. You will die trying.""

The big bad wolf has taken the challenge. After punching the doors of the house to enter, he wasn't able to penetrate, not even a mere scratch. For days, the wolf tried to break into the house, but he was no match for the pig's house. 

""Are you done?"" said the 92nd little pig to the wolf.

""I will find a way to break your house and eat you!"" said the wolf. ""I will not give up!""

The big bad wolf gave up the next day. The 92nd little pig found her opportunity to avenge her brothers and sisters. She said, ""You see, you can't break my house. Now, it's my turn.""

The 92nd little pig has activated a button that revealed a trapdoor underneath the wolf. The wolf fell down to his death as he got eaten by a bunch of sharks underneath the house. The little pig grinned saying, ""I told you that you can't break my house.""

The 92nd little pig wasn't the only one with such accomplishments done with their house.

The pig said, ""I know what you're thinking, but you can't come in. This house is built with depleted uranium. You will die trying.""

The big bad wolf has taken the challenge. After punching the doors of the house to enter, he wasn't able to penetrate, not even a mere scratch. For days, the wolf tried to break into the house, but he was no match for the pig's house. 

""Are you done?"" said the 92nd little pig to the wolf.

""I will find a way to break your house and eat you!"" said the wolf. ""I will not give up!""

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""

""That's a really cool house you have there, piggy."" said the wolf in astonishment. The 92nd little pig was expecting the wolf. She has prepared almost her entire life that lead up to this moment. She didn't want to end up like those of her brothers and sisters that had been eaten by the wolf.

The pig said, ""I know what you're thinking, but you can't come in. This house is built with depleted uranium. You will die trying.""

The big bad wolf has taken the challenge. After punching the doors of the house to enter, he wasn't able to penetrate, not even a mere scratch. For days, the wolf tried to break into the house, but he was no match for the pig's house. 

""Are you done?"" said the 92nd little pig to the wolf.

""I will find a way to break your house and eat you!"" said the wolf. ""I will not give up!""

The big bad wolf gave up the next day. The 92nd little pig found her opportunity to avenge her brothers and sisters. She said, ""You see, you can't break my house. Now, it's my turn.""

The 92nd little pig has activated a button that revealed a trapdoor underneath the wolf. The wolf fell down to his death as he got eaten by a bunch of sharks underneath the house. The little pig grinned saying, ""I told you that you can't break my house.""

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""

""That's a really cool house you have there, piggy."" said the wolf in astonishment. The 92nd little pig was expecting the wolf. She has prepared almost her entire life that lead up to this moment. She didn't want to end up like those of her brothers and sisters that had been eaten by the wolf.

The pig said, ""I know what you're thinking, but you can't come in. This house is built with depleted uranium. You will die trying.""

The big bad wolf has taken the challenge. After punching the doors of the house to enter, he wasn't able to penetrate, not even a mere scratch. For days, the wolf tried to break into the house, but he was no match for the pig's house. 

""Are you done?"" said the 92nd little pig to the wolf.

""I will find a way to break your house and eat you!"" said the wolf. ""I will not give up!""

The big bad wolf gave up the next day. The 92nd little pig found her opportunity to avenge her brothers and sisters. She said, ""You see, you can't break my house. Now, it's my turn.""

The 92nd little pig has activated a button that revealed a trapdoor underneath the wolf. The wolf fell down to his death as he got eaten by a bunch of sharks underneath the house. The little pig grinned saying, ""I told you that you can't break my house.""

The 92nd little pig wasn't the only one with such accomplishments done with their house. After they have eliminated all their natural predators, the other pigs have built houses out of things that cannot be broken. They've also started to fight crime that were happening in their neighborhood. The 78th little pig started to help the police to catch the bad guys. The 47th little pig went ahead and started to help the fire department to put out fires. The 116th little pig started to help the paramedics to heal the sick and injured. With all their resourcefulness, all the little pigs were given a new name: ",2248,[],0,0,5,30,0.3,1,0,0,1746
