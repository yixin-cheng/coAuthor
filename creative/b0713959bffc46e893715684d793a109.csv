The phones rang and rang but no one answered. The only way they were getting the news is with a very old CRT TV that still receives signal from old TV waves.

The aides reported back to the president with their report. Their reactivated satellites that were dormant for 50 years revealed no movement nor any other human activity visible in the other parts of the world.

""They just left, Ms. President,"" said one of the aides. ""We've tracked a spaceship heading towards Mars. The last people on earth left 10 hours ago.""
