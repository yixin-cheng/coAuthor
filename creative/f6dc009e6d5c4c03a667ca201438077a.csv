""Everything. The President back then was ruthless, self absorbed, and determined to put the US in control of the whole world. And our military was strong enough to do it. If it hadn't been for the other nations of the world uniting against us, we would have won. And even then, they were afraid of us recovering faster and trying again.

But they had become very practical over the period of self isolation and they weren't going to give up, or do anything rash now. They were going to work together to get their country back on its feet and then they were going to start working on the rest of the world.
