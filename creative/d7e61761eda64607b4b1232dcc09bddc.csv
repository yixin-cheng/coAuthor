 He's kind and attentive. On top of being gorgeous, he is also funny and well educated. Sara, the woman, thinks she has certainly found the man of her dreams.

 He's kind and attentive. On top of being gorgeous, he is also funny and well educated. Sara, the woman, thinks she has certainly found the man of her dreams. She doesn't know, of course, that Poc (Person Often Changing) is really a shapeshifter. Poc is having the time of his life on this date, and sees that Sara is really starting to fall in love with him. He knows that he has to tell her the truth about himself, but he doesn't want to lose her.

Poc and Sara go on many dates over the next several months. Each time they grow closer together. Poc knows that he must be truthful with Sara.  He tells her that he is a shapeshifter, and that he has been with many women in the past. Sara is shocked, but she is not completely freaked out by this. She wasn't expecting to hear this from the man of her dreams. Poc is so sad and afraid. He tells Sara that he has lived many centuries searching for the right woman. Like a vampire that is immortal. He can only move on and grow old when he finds the woman of his dreams. And she truly loves him in return. Poc tells Sara everything. That he has been infatuated with her for years.

They go out on a date, and the woman is surprised to find that Pogcis nothing like the other guys she's dated.
 He's kind and attentive. On top of being gorgeous, he is also funny and well educated. Sara, the woman, thinks she has certainly found the man of her dreams. She doesn't know, of course, that Poc (Person Often Changing) is really a shapeshifter. Poc is having the time of his life on this date, and sees that Sara is really starting to fall in love with him. He knows that he has to tell her the truth about himself, but he doesn't want to lose her.

Poc and Sara go on many dates over the next several months. Each time they grow closer together. Poc knows that he must be truthful with Sara.  He tells her that he is a shapeshifter, and that he has been with many women in the past. Sara is shocked, but she is not completely freaked out by this. She wasn't expecting to hear this from the man of her dreams. Poc is so sad and afraid. He tells Sara that he has lived many centuries searching for the right woman. Like a vampire that is immortal. He can only move on and grow old when he finds the woman of his dreams. And she truly loves him in return. Poc tells Sara everything. That he has been infatuated with her for years. That all of the 'losers' she dated in the past, were really him.  Sara is stunned into silence. She begins to cry and turns away.

One day, she meets a guy who seems different from the rest, and she can’t help but be drawn to him. She thinks, ""What the heck. Let's give this a try."" She agrees to go on a date with the man, and finds out his name is Poc. She thinks that is a really unusual name, but for some reason, that only makes the woman more intrigued by this man.
They go out on a date, and the woman is surprised to find that Pogcis nothing like the other guys she's dated.
 He's kind and attentive. On top of being gorgeous, he is also funny and well educated. Sara, the woman, thinks she has certainly found the man of her dreams.

Poc and Sara go on many dates over the next several months. Each time they grow closer together. Poc knows that he must be truthful with Sara.

 He's kind and attentive. On top of being gorgeous, he is also funny and well educated. Sara, the woman, thinks she has certainly found the man of her dreams.

She agrees to go on a date with the man, and finds out his name is Poc. She thinks that is a really unusual name, but for some reason, that only makes the woman more intrigued by this man.
They go out on a date, and the woman is surprised to find that Pogcis nothing like the other guys she's dated.
 He's kind and attentive. On top of being gorgeous, he is also funny and well educated. Sara, the woman, thinks she has certainly found the man of her dreams. She doesn't know, of course, that Poc (Person Often Changing) is really a shapeshifter. Poc is having the time of his life on this date, and sees that Sara is really starting to fall in love with him. He knows that he has to tell her the truth about himself, but he doesn't want to lose her.

Poc and Sara go on many dates over the next several months. Each time they grow closer together. Poc knows that he must be truthful with Sara.  He tells her that he is a shapeshifter, and that he has been with many women in the past. Sara is shocked, but she is not completely freaked out by this. She wasn't expecting to hear this from the man of her dreams. Poc is so sad and afraid. He tells Sara that he has lived many centuries searching for the right woman. Like a vampire that is immortal. He can only move on and grow old when he finds the woman of his dreams. And she truly loves him in return. Poc tells Sara everything. That he has been infatuated with her for years. That all of the 'losers' she dated in the past, were really him.  Sara is stunned into silence. She begins to cry and turns away.
Poc is heartbroken.
 He sits in silence and in pain. He feels like his heart is being torn out of his chest. Sara turns to him. There is forgiveness in her eyes. She tells him that she understands. She know that it took great courage for Poc to tell her all of this, and that is the one thing that has been missing in all her relationships.

She agrees to go on a date with the man, and finds out his name is Poc. She thinks that is a really unusual name, but for some reason, that only makes the woman more intrigued by this man.
They go out on a date, and the woman is surprised to find that Pogcis nothing like the other guys she's dated.
 He's kind and attentive. On top of being gorgeous, he is also funny and well educated. Sara, the woman, thinks she has certainly found the man of her dreams.

That all of the 'losers' she dated in the past, were really him.  Sara is stunned into silence. She begins to cry and turns away.
Poc is heartbroken.

They go out on a date, and the woman is surprised to find that Pogcis nothing like the other guys she's dated.
 He's kind and attentive. On top of being gorgeous, he is also funny and well educated. Sara, the woman, thinks she has certainly found the man of her dreams. She doesn't know, of course, that Poc (Person Often Changing) is really a shapeshifter. Poc is having the time of his life on this date, and sees that Sara is really starting to fall in love with him. He knows that he has to tell her the truth about himself, but he doesn't want to lose her.

Poc and Sara go on many dates over the next several months. Each time they grow closer together. Poc knows that he must be truthful with Sara.

They go out on a date, and the woman is surprised to find that Pogcis nothing like the other guys she's dated.
 He's kind and attentive. On top of being gorgeous, he is also funny and well educated. Sara, the woman, thinks she has certainly found the man of her dreams. She doesn't know, of course, that Poc (Person Often Changing) is really a shapeshifter. Poc is having the time of his life on this date, and sees that Sara is really starting to fall in love with him. He knows that he has to tell her the truth about himself, but he doesn't want to lose her.

Poc and Sara go on many dates over the next several months. Each time they grow closer together. Poc knows that he must be truthful with Sara.  He tells her that he is a shapeshifter, and that he has been with many women in the past. Sara is shocked, but she is not completely freaked out by this. She wasn't expecting to hear this from the man of her dreams. Poc is so sad and afraid. He tells Sara that he has lived many centuries searching for the right woman. Like a vampire that is immortal. He can only move on and grow old when he finds the woman of his dreams. And she truly loves him in return. Poc tells Sara everything. That he has been infatuated with her for years. That all of the 'losers' she dated in the past, were really him.  Sara is stunned into silence. She begins to cry and turns away.
Poc is heartbroken.
 He sits in silence and in pain. He feels like his heart is being torn out of his chest. Sara turns to him. There is forgiveness in her eyes. She tells him that she understands. She know that it took great courage for Poc to tell her all of this, and that is the one thing that has been missing in all her relationships. Someone truthful and courageous. Poc is so relieved he wants to jump for joy. Hiding his real self all this time has been what has kept Sara from really loving him. Poc and Sara fall in love and get married. They buy the house they have both dreamed of. They have a wonderful life together. Poc finally begins to age, and is so relieved that he gets to grow old with the woman he dreamt of his whole life.
