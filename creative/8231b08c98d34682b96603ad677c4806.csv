He was a royal bee so whatever human he stung became a bee. And all of those bees in my clan...they all were stung by each other. This royal bee is trying to turn all humans into bees. Why? World domination. 

He tells you ""Humans have been oppressing bees for so long, now it's time for bees to dominant over humans."" You think for a bit and understand his point of view. Humans are always swatting at bees, spraying them with water and ultimately viewing them as the enemy. In reality these bees just want to pollinate flowers and create honey.
