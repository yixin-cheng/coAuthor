But with over 7 billion of us on the planet now, Mana has spread far too thinly to have any effect. When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.
Dwarves have mined the earth for centuries, creating huge underground cities and a lush eco-system beneath the surface.
 But when they finally come into contact with humans, their fabled underground wealth proves to be the least of humanity’s worries. A civil war breaks out. 
On the surface, humans and elves live in peaceful coexistence.
 However behind the scenes there is a hatred between both groups. Elves are jealous of humans. Humans are overstepping their boundaries and are trying to rule the elves. 

Elves are slowly becoming a less powerful race and are losing land in the process. The humans are taking over their land similar to the way America was stolen from the Native Americans. 

The elves are secretly killing off humans and the humans don't even realize it. The elves are poisoning the water and food supply. Humans are dying one by one and the elves are beginning to get on even footing in terms of power. But are they too late?

The humans ended up figuring out how the elves were poisoning their supplies. They were furious. They decided that the elves needed to be dealt with. They began to fight back. One by one they started to eliminate the elf population. The elves had a large advantage in numbers, but that didn't matter. The humans were too strong and had too powerful of weaponry. The elves were losing their power and the humans were gaining it. The remaining elves decided to make a peace agreement with the humans. They would give up 70% of their land and keep 30% of their land. 
The elves were satisfied with the deal, but the humans soon made an amendment to it.
 They wanted all the remaining elves to move to a reservation where the elves could create their own laws and rules and live without any human interference. The elves reluctantly agreed and moved to the reservation. The conflict was over and the humans and elves didn't bother with each other ever again. So many lives were lost over a stupid conflict that could have ended in a compromise from the beginning.",2284,[],0,4,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,1443
