Kimmel said, ""Matt Damon, if you can see this, it's Jimmy Kimmel. I don't know if you know this, but you've been kidnapped."" A lot of other news media outlets are also doubting the credibility of the alien story. ""The aliens have been with us for just over a year, and they've been very friendly,"" said the CNN reporter. ""It's not very likely that they kidnapped Matt Damon, but even if they did, Mr. Damon is a very nice man, and he's a very good actor, and I'm sure he'll be fine.""

Of course, Matt Damon was well known for this sci-fi movies such as The Martian, Interstellar, and The Bourne Identity. So for any celebrity to be kidnapped by aliens, Matt Damon would be on top of the list for the most qualified celebrity to take on the aliens. One of the most popular Youtuber, PewDiePie, said, ""I'm not saying that Matt Damon is a bad actor, but he's not the best actor out there."" as he tried to contact the alien spaceship to see if Matt is still in there. Upon being beamed up to the space ship, PewDiePie was greeted by the alien guard and said  ""I'm sorry, but you can't come in.

Other pranksters and social media influencers were also trying to save Matt Damon but no efforts have come close to getting him back. The hashtag #SaveMattDamon was trending on Twitter, and even the President of the United States, Donald Trump (who is in his 5th term), tweeted about it. ""Matt, I sure do hope you're okay. I'm doing all I can to get you back. I'm sending all of my best people to help you. #SaveMattDamon,"" the President tweeted on Thursday.
