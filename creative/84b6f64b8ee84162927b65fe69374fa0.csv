The two stared at each other for a moment, both confused by the other's reaction. The wolf finally said, ""It's too much. Like, literally, too much radiation. I gotta go."" 

Clyde laughed as the wolf started backing away. ""Lol, dude, wait. What kind of idiot do you think I am? I mean, like, no one would ever build a house out of depleted uranium. Not without proper shielding and other mitigating measures. Did you seriously forget I have a Ph.D in physics with a focus of nuclear physics?""

Clyde smiled wide. ""I thought you would like it. But now I don't know what to do, I built it so far away from Mom's and she is whining at me to move closer to home. I'm going to have to move.""

The wolf nodded, ""Bummer dude. But can you afford 2 houses?""

The 92nd little pig sighed and shock his head. ""Nope and that it my problem. I literally can't afford anything because I spent all my money building this house and I'm broke.""

All of a sudden the wolf looked excited. ""Hey, I've been meaning to move out of that old cottage in the woods. Maybe I could buy this house from you?""

Clyde tried not to look too eager. ""Um, well, I dunno...But maybe...sure, we could do that."" 

A quick bit of dealing, a firm handshake, and a down payment later, and the house was now the wolf's. He started making preparations to move in as the 92nd pig walked away, pretending to look sad.
