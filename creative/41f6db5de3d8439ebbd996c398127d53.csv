Those younger and able to fight the hordes of insane were locked down. The horde wiped out more and more of humanity and the military had no solution. The military surrendered the last intact human city and those still alive.

As an 85-year-old, you were physically unfit for war against this ravenous horde. Worse yet, very few of the younger lost generation members remained.

Thinking back to a movie plot you vaguely remember, you had the idea of giving the horde another dose of the very drug that caused all this. Why would that work? Well it turns out, it had been done before, and an additional dose of the once miracle drug turned disaster would be fatal. In your younger days you worked on a farm and learned how to crop dust the fields. You get together with other pilots and crop dust the world dispensing another dose of the drug to the horde and eventually help to wipe it out.
