When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.
Unusual gems and magical talismans are appearing all over the world.
  They're called ""Shards"" and those who have them can draw upon the vast stores of magic energy they contain.  As more and more of these Shards are found, the magic within them is being used to resurrect a world that was lost during the great war.
Mgical power comes with a price.
  Every Shard has a human host, and as the power of magic works to recreate the world as it once was, these hosts begin to die...Will humanity make the tradeoff?
A young man named Asher is drawn to a mysterious Shard that is accompanied by an ethereal woman.
  He is the latest in a long line of hosts and he is about to discover his true purpose.
sher's destiny is to protect every Shard and their hosts, as well as serve as one of the last links between our world and
 the magical one that has been lost for so long. 

Now he must learn to master his powers, and lead humanity into a new age of magic.
 
f he fails, he will die.
  If he succeeds, the world will be reborn.  The stakes have never been higher.  Asher longs to use the Shards power to defeat the aliens.

What Asher does not know, however, is that, in their own way, the aliens see themselves as beneficial beings. They try to heal the world, by culling the humans. They want to restore the humans connection with Mana. They are trying to do good, by their own twisted standard. 
The aliens are not all bad, but the humans are not all good.
 There are also corrupt humans who want to use Mana to control others. With so much magic now available to the humans, this will be a time of great change for Earth.
