You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand. Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" You scream ""don't bite me!"" and the bee says ""I'm not a bee, I'm your guardian angel. I'm here to tell you that you're not allergic, it was a lie. 

It is the middle of the night and no one is protecting you. You do not know how this bee got in your room. You hope your mom heard your scream but you want to know about this lie. You know that if you call your mother, she'll be mad at the bee. You demand the bee tell you why your mother would lie. The bee just says ""To protect you."" You don't understand and the bee explains ""You're a princess."" You are destined for a life of royalty when you are an adult. You will be a queen.

Your mother has not told you because she wants you to have a good childhood. But she has protected you so much you have never been free. Now you must tell her of the bee. Now that you are older it is time to get ready for your adult life. You tell your mother about the bee. She hugs you and tells you she knew this time would come. She hopes you will understand it was her job to keep you safe so she did what she had to do.  You understand and promise to always love he",1374,[],0,4,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,1120
