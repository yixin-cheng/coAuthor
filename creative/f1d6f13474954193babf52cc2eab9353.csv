She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. The shapeshifter who's name is David has tried to get information from her each time on what kind of man she likes. Sometimes David is able to get valuable info before the date ends other time he does not because the date ends badly.  After about 20 different dates with her using 20 different forms, David thinks he finally has the perfect mix of personality and looks. Now he is certain he's going to win her heart. 
David runs into the women in a familiar place and says a few things known to get her attention and then asks her out on a date. She accepts and they meet up later that night. David is everything she had been looking for. He had the looks, the attitude, and everything else she could think of. He was almost too good to be true. David was able to talk about everything the woman wanted. He responded in a way that was very familar to her but she overlooked that because of how in tune they were. The women invites David back to her house after the date. He agrees and is so excited he says without thinking that he cant wait to the painting on her wall again. This really caught the women off guard since she never mentioned the painting and he had never been to her house, we she assumed anyway. AThe women was freaked out but David did not seem to notice. She then asked him a few more qustions to see how he responded. It was exactly the responses she expected and knew right then David was more then just a stalker, he knew almost everything about her. She then stopped and confronted David. He was caught off guard by the sudden questioning that he hesitated and then blurted out the truth that he was a shapeshifter who had been on several dates with her already. He then begged her to let him explain and she did. She was a bit intrigued and decided to actually give him another chance. This time they really hit it off and married one year later.
