When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.

The story has been told to me so many times, I feel confident enough to share it with others. Follow me into this world as I provide a short explanation of what I'm talking about.
The story of Mana is a story of the human race.

What is Mana? It's power. It's strength. it's discipline. It's hope. Love. Wonder. 

Mana is something that all people used to possess; humans were innately born with it, possessed by its kindness, and automatically instilled with how to use it.
But with the advancement of technology, the human race has become so dependent on it that we've forgotten how to use Mana.

(Not Kidding.)
