 You call your mother, but the voice that answers says ""JFK."" You ask ""How did you get my mother's number?"" and the voice replies ""I know where you live, Barack,"" in a tone that says ""this is not up for discussion.""
So you go to your parent's house.
 The door is open. You walk in to see your mother cooking dinner and JFK sitting at the table. He has a single piece of paper in front of him. He looks up at you and smiles.
""Please have a seat, Barack.
 We need to talk about your next move.""

""There is no next move,"" says Obama. ""I am retired. I go golfing every day and eat organic cuisine.""
""That's not the real you,"" says JFK.

""It is the real me.

You go to a different site.
 They've taken down all of JFK's pages. Instead, the redirect is to a page that simple has your picture on it.
YBut you are not alone in the picture. Next to you is a the house you grew up in. our mother's house.
 You call your mother, but the voice that answers says ""JFK."" You ask ""How did you get my mother's number?"" and the voice replies ""I know where you live, Barack,"" in a tone that says ""this is not up for discussion.""
So you go to your parent's house.
 The door is open. You walk in to see your mother cooking dinner and JFK sitting at the table. He has a single piece of paper in front of him. He looks up at you and smiles.
""Please have a seat, Barack.
 We need to talk about your next move.""

""There is no next move,"" says Obama. ""I am retired. I go golfing every day and eat organic cuisine.""
""That's not the real you,"" says JFK.

""It is the real me.
""

""Don't you want to save the world from certain doom?""

""How much does it pay,"" asks Obama.
""Nothing,"" says JFK.

""Please have a seat, Barack.

""There is no next move,"" says Obama. ""I am retired. I go golfing every day and eat organic cuisine.""
""That's not the real you,"" says JFK.

""It is the real me.

""Don't you want to save the world from certain doom?""

""How much does it pay,"" asks Obama.
""Nothing,"" says JFK.

 The door is open. You walk in to see your mother cooking dinner and JFK sitting at the table. He has a single piece of paper in front of him. He looks up at you and smiles.
""Please have a seat, Barack.
 We need to talk about your next move.""

""There is no next move,"" says Obama. ""I am retired. I go golfing every day and eat organic cuisine.""
""That's not the real you,"" says JFK.

""It is the real me.
""

""Don't you want to save the world from certain doom?""

""How much does it pay,"" asks Obama.
""Nothing,"" says JFK.


""Then piss of,"" says Obama. ""You know it's all about the Benjamins these days.""
Obama turns to walk out.
 JFK looks at him, then turns to the paper. He stares at it, and then looks up. ""Okay,"" he says, ""you are released. You are free to go.""
And Obama leaves the house, and goes to play golf.

So you go to your parent's house.
 The door is open. You walk in to see your mother cooking dinner and JFK sitting at the table. He has a single piece of paper in front of him. He looks up at you and smiles.
""Please have a seat, Barack.
 We need to talk about your next move.""

""There is no next move,"" says Obama. ""I am retired. I go golfing every day and eat organic cuisine.""
""That's not the real you,"" says JFK.

""It is the real me.
""

""Don't you want to save the world from certain doom?""

""How much does it pay,"" asks Obama.
""Nothing,"" says JFK.


""Then piss of,"" says Obama. ""You know it's all about the Benjamins these days.""
Obama turns to walk out.
 JFK looks at him, then turns to the paper. He stares at it, and then looks up. ""Okay,"" he says, ""you are released. You are free to go.""
And Obama leaves the house, and goes to play golf.

So you go to your parent's house.
 The door is open. You walk in to see your mother cooking dinner and JFK sitting at the table. He has a single piece of paper in front of him. He looks up at you and smiles.
""Please have a seat, Barack.
 We need to talk about your next move.""

""There is no next move,"" says Obama. ""I am retired. I go golfing every day and eat organic cuisine.""
""That's not the real you,"" says JFK.

""It is the real me.
""

""Don't you want to save the world from certain doom?""

""How much does it pay,"" asks Obama.
""Nothing,"" says JFK.


""Then piss of,"" says Obama. ""You know it's all about the Benjamins these days.""
Obama turns to walk out.
 JFK looks at him, then turns to the paper. He stares at it, and then looks up. ""Okay,"" he says, ""you are released. You are free to go.""
And Obama leaves the house, and goes to play golf.
 A tall man with orange skin joins him. ""Hi,"" says the man. ""Don't tell me JFK tries to recruit you too?""
