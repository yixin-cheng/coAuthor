 A person can only receive one miracle in their lifetime, so you must choose carefully who will have the ultimate reward. There is not only pressure on the person receiving the miracle, but there is also pressure on you. 

Giving miracles is a huge responsibility. What happens if you give a miracle to someone who does not deserve it? Or what happens if you give the wrong miracle to the right person? These pressures can be a lot for one person to handle. But you have been chosen to give these miracles to people. You are helping them experience a reincarnation of their own. 
Through your decisions, you will be shaping their lives and the lives of everyone they come in contact with.
 They will be grateful for the miracle and will give it back to you by continuing to spread the gift in their own lives. Over time, you will see the effect of these miracles. Some of the effects will be good. Some of the effects will be bad.

Although you are giving miracles away, you are giving them to humans. Humans are not perfect beings. They have flaws. They can be selfish. They can be very self-serving. They can be very greedy. But they also can be helpful. They can be kind. They can be loving.

 A person can only receive one miracle in their lifetime, so you must choose carefully who will have the ultimate reward. There is not only pressure on the person receiving the miracle, but there is also pressure on you. 

Giving miracles is a huge responsibility. What happens if you give a miracle to someone who does not deserve it? Or what happens if you give the wrong miracle to the right person? These pressures can be a lot for one person to handle. But you have been chosen to give these miracles to people. You are helping them experience a reincarnation of their own. 
Through your decisions, you will be shaping their lives and the lives of everyone they come in contact with.
 They will be grateful for the miracle and will give it back to you by continuing to spread the gift in their own lives. Over time, you will see the effect of these miracles. Some of the effects will be good. Some of the effects will be bad.

Although you are giving miracles away, you are giving them to humans. Humans are not perfect beings. They have flaws. They can be selfish. They can be very self-serving. They can be very greedy. But they also can be helpful. They can be kind. They can be loving.

Human beings die in terms of the physical world. Our spirit doesn't die. Whether it be reincarnation, heaven or something else, our spirit ascends. We do not die with the physical body.
