The news anchor was doing the story from a studio in New York and as soon as he started talking about the phenomenon, the mug on his desk changed to ""#500,000,000 Dad"".  He looked down at his mug and was startled a bit.  However, he was a professional and continued to do the segment.   The news organization had interviewed a woman who said he was responsible for the changing mugs.

She used a powerful spell that would reveal how good the dad's around the world actually were.   ust as the woman was about to explain the spell, she was interrupted by a mug that changed in her hand.
  She looked at the mug with disdain.  She said this was her father's mug.  She didn't show the number, but she seemed to agree with her father's ranking.

I have always thought I was a good dad.  My wife and I have been married for over 20 years and we have three beautiful children.  I was desperately curious to see what ranking my mug gave me.   I quietly walked to the kitchen.  Since I am the first one up every morning, I was alone while I was in the kitchen.  I started to open up the cabinet where I keep my mug.  Then, I paused.  What if I'm ranked ""1,000,000,001 Dad?"".  What if my ranking is absurdly low?  Is it worth it to torment myself.

After spending several minutes in thought, I had made a decision.  I closed my eyes and opened the cabinet.  I grabbed my mug a",1794,[],3,3,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,1996

Dads around the world were watching their #1 Dad mugs change to different, seemingly random numbers right in front of their eyes.

Dads around the world were watching their #1 Dad mugs change to different, seemingly random numbers right in front of their eyes.        

The news anchor was doing the story from a studio in New York and as soon as he started talking about the phenomenon, the mug on his desk changed to ""#500,000,000 Dad"".  He looked down at his mug and was startled a bit.  However, he was a professional and continued to do the segment.   The news organization had interviewed a woman who said he was responsible for the changing mugs.

She used a powerful spell that would reveal how good the dad's around the world actually were.   ust as the woman was about to explain the spell, she was interrupted by a mug that changed in her hand.
  She looked at the mug with disdain.  She said this was her father's mug.  She didn't show the number, but she seemed to agree with her father's ranking.

I have always thought I was a good dad.  My wife and I have been married for over 20 years and we have three beautiful children.  I was desperately curious to see what ranking my mug gave me.

What if I'm ranked ""1,000,000,001 Dad?"".  What if my ranking is absurdly low?  Is it worth it to torment myself.

After spending several minutes in thought, I had made a decision.  I closed my eyes and opened the cabinet.  I grabbed my mug and covered it with my hand.  I proceeded to take it to t",1850,[],3,3,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,2054

When I wake up every morning, my daily ritual is to watch the 6 o'clock news.  When I turned on the news, the first story detailed a weird phenomenon that seemed to be happening around the world.  Dads around the world were watching their #1 Dad mugs change to different, seemingly random numbers right in front of their eyes.        

The news anchor was doing the story from a studio in New York and as soon as he started talking about the phenomenon, the mug on his desk changed to ""#500,000,000 Dad"".

The news organization had interviewed a woman who said he was responsible for the changing mugs.

She used a powerful spell that would reveal how good the dad's around the world actually were.   ust as the woman was about to explain the spell, she was interrupted by a mug that changed in her hand.
  She looked at the mug with disdain.  She said this was her father's mug.  She didn't show the number, but she seemed to agree with her father's ranking.

Dads around the world were watching their #1 Dad mugs change to different, seemingly random numbers right in front of their eyes.        

The news anchor was doing the story from a studio in New York and as soon as he started talking about the phenomenon, the mug on his desk changed to ""#500,000,000 Dad"".  He looked down at his mug and was startled a bit.  However, he was a professional and continued to do the segment.   The news organization had interviewed a woman who said he was responsible for the changing mugs.

She used a powerful spell that would reveal how good the dad's around the world actually were.   ust as the woman was about to explain the spell, she was interrupted by a mug that changed in her hand.
  She looked at the mug with disdain.  She said this was her father's mug.  She didn't show the number, but she seemed to agree with her father's ranking.

I have always thought I was a good dad.  My wife and I have been married for over 20 years and we have three beautiful children.  I was desperately curious to see what ranking my mug gave me.   I quietly walked to the kitchen.  Since I am the first one up every morning, I was alone while I was in the kitchen.  I started to open up the cabinet where I keep my mug.  Then, I paused.  What if I'm ranked ""1,000,000,001 Dad?"".  What if my ranking is absurdly low?  Is it worth it to torment myself.

After spending several minutes in thought, I had made a decision.  I closed my eyes and opened the cabinet.  I grabbed my mug and covered it with my hand.  I proceeded to dump it in the trash.  ",1861,[],0,3,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,2111

Dads around the world were watching their #1 Dad mugs change to different, seemingly random numbers right in front of their eyes.        

The news anchor was doing the story from a studio in New York and as soon as he started talking about the phenomenon, the mug on his desk changed to ""#500,000,000 Dad"".  He looked down at his mug and was startled a bit.  However, he was a professional and continued to do the segment.   The news organization had interviewed a woman who said he was responsible for the changing mugs.

She used a powerful spell that would reveal how good the dad's around the world actually were.   ust as the woman was about to explain the spell, she was interrupted by a mug that changed in her hand.
  She looked at the mug with disdain.  She said this was her father's mug.  She didn't show the number, but she seemed to agree with her father's ranking.

When I wake up every morning, my daily ritual is to watch the 6 o'clock news.  When I turned on the news, the first story detailed a weird phenomenon that seemed to be happening around the world.  Dads around the world were watching their #1 Dad mugs change to different, seemingly random numbers right in front of their eyes.        

The news anchor was doing the story from a studio in New York and as soon as he started talking about the phenomenon, the mug on his desk changed to ""#500,000,000 Dad"".  He looked down at his mug and was startled a bit.  However, he was a professional and continued to do the segment.   The news organization had interviewed a woman who said he was responsible for the changing mugs.

She used a powerful spell that would reveal how good the dad's around the world actually were.   ust as the woman was about to explain the spell, she was interrupted by a mug that changed in her hand.
  She looked at the mug with disdain.  She said this was her father's mug.  She didn't show the number, but she seemed to agree with her father's ranking.

When I wake up every morning, my daily ritual is to watch the 6 o'clock news.  When I turned on the news, the first story detailed a weird phenomenon that seemed to be happening around the world.  Dads around the world were watching their #1 Dad mugs change to different, seemingly random numbers right in front of their eyes.        

The news anchor was doing the story from a studio in New York and as soon as he started talking about the phenomenon, the mug on his desk changed to ""#500,000,000 Dad"".  He looked down at his mug and was startled a bit.  However, he was a professional and continued to do the segment.   The news organization had interviewed a woman who said he was responsible for the changing mugs.

She used a powerful spell that would reveal how good the dad's around the world actually were.   ust as the woman was about to explain the spell, she was interrupted by a mug that changed in her hand.
  She looked at the mug with disdain.  She said this was her father's mug.  She didn't show the number, but she seemed to agree with her father's ranking.

Dads around the world were watching their #1 Dad mugs change to different, seemingly random numbers right in front of their eyes.        

The news anchor was doing the story from a studio in New York and as soon as he started talking about the phenomenon, the mug on his desk changed to ""#500,000,000 Dad"".  He looked down at his mug and was startled a bit.  However, he was a professional and continued to do the segment.   The news organization had interviewed a woman who said he was responsible for the changing mugs.

She used a powerful spell that would reveal how good the dad's around the world actually were.   ust as the woman was about to explain the spell, she was interrupted by a mug that changed in her hand.
  She looked at the mug with disdain.  She said this was her father's mug.  She didn't show the number, but she seemed to agree with her father's ranking.

After spending several minutes in thought, I had made a decision.  I closed my eyes and opened the cabinet.  I grabbed my mug and covered it with my hand.  I proceeded to dump it in the trash.

The news anchor was doing the story from a studio in New York and as soon as he started talking about the phenomenon, the mug on his desk changed to ""#500,000,000 Dad"".  He looked down at his mug and was startled a bit.  However, he was a professional and continued to do the segment.   The news organization had interviewed a woman who said he was responsible for the changing mugs.

She used a powerful spell that would reveal how good the dad's around the world actually were.   ust as the woman was about to explain the spell, she was interrupted by a mug that changed in her hand.
  She looked at the mug with disdain.  She said this was her father's mug.  She didn't show the number, but she seemed to agree with her father's ranking.

I have always thought I was a good dad.  My wife and I have been married for over 20 years and we have three beautiful children.  I was desperately curious to see what ranking my mug gave me.   I quietly walked to the kitchen.  Since I am the first one up every morning, I was alone while I was in the kitchen.  I started to open up the cabinet where I keep my mug.  Then, I paused.  What if I'm ranked ""1,000,000,001 Dad?"".  What if my ranking is absurdly low?  Is it worth it to torment myself.

After spending several minutes in thought, I had made a decision.  I closed my eyes and opened the cabinet.  I grabbed my mug and covered it with my hand.  I proceeded to dump it in the trash.

When I wake up every morning, my daily ritual is to watch the 6 o'clock news.  When I turned on the news, the first story detailed a weird phenomenon that seemed to be happening around the world.  Dads around the world were watching their #1 Dad mugs change to different, seemingly random numbers right in front of their eyes.        

The news anchor was doing the story from a studio in New York and as soon as he started talking about the phenomenon, the mug on his desk changed to ""#500,000,000 Dad"".  He looked down at his mug and was startled a bit.  However, he was a professional and continued to do the segment.   The news organization had interviewed a woman who said he was responsible for the changing mugs.

She used a powerful spell that would reveal how good the dad's around the world actually were.   ust as the woman was about to explain the spell, she was interrupted by a mug that changed in her hand.
  She looked at the mug with disdain.  She said this was her father's mug.  She didn't show the number, but she seemed to agree with her father's ranking.

I quietly walked to the kitchen.  Since I am the first one up every morning, I was alone while I was in the kitchen.  I started to open up the cabinet where I keep my mug.  Then, I paused.  What if I'm ranked ""1,000,000,001 Dad?"".  What if my ranking is absurdly low?  Is it worth it to torment myself.

After spending several minutes in thought, I had made a decision.  I closed my eyes and opened the cabinet.  I grabbed my mug and covered it with my hand.  I proceeded to dump it in the trash.

I quietly walked to the kitchen.  Since I am the first one up every morning, I was alone while I was in the kitchen.  I started to open up the cabinet where I keep my mug.  Then, I paused.  What if I'm ranked ""1,000,000,001 Dad?"".  What if my ranking is absurdly low?  Is it worth it to torment myself.

After spending several minutes in thought, I had made a decision.  I closed my eyes and opened the cabinet.  I grabbed my mug and covered it with my hand.  I proceeded to dump it in the trash.   I had come to the conclusion that it would torment me if I looked at the mug.  I know that I try my hardest every day as a father.  I don't need a mug to tell me where I rank.

The news anchor was doing the story from a studio in New York and as soon as he started talking about the phenomenon, the mug on his desk changed to ""#500,000,000 Dad"".  He looked down at his mug and was startled a bit.  However, he was a professional and continued to do the segment.   The news organization had interviewed a woman who said he was responsible for the changing mugs.

She used a powerful spell that would reveal how good the dad's around the world actually were.   ust as the woman was about to explain the spell, she was interrupted by a mug that changed in her hand.
  She looked at the mug with disdain.  She said this was her father's mug.  She didn't show the number, but she seemed to agree with her father's ranking.

I have always thought I was a good dad.  My wife and I have been married for over 20 years and we have three beautiful children.  I was desperately curious to see what ranking my mug gave me.   I quietly walked to the kitchen.  Since I am the first one up every morning, I was alone while I was in the kitchen.  I started to open up the cabinet where I keep my mug.  Then, I paused.  What if I'm ranked ""1,000,000,001 Dad?"".  What if my ranking is absurdly low?  Is it worth it to torment myself.

After spending several minutes in thought, I had made a decision.  I closed my eyes and opened the cabinet.  I grabbed my mug and covered it with my hand.  I proceeded to dump it in the trash.   I had come to the conclusion that it would torment me if I looked at the mug.  I know that I try my hardest every day as a father.  I don't need a mug to tell me where I rank.

When I wake up every morning, my daily ritual is to watch the 6 o'clock news.  When I turned on the news, the first story detailed a weird phenomenon that seemed to be happening around the world.  Dads around the world were watching their #1 Dad mugs change to different, seemingly random numbers right in front of their eyes.        

The news anchor was doing the story from a studio in New York and as soon as he started talking about the phenomenon, the mug on his desk changed to ""#500,000,000 Dad"".  He looked down at his mug and was startled a bit.  However, he was a professional and continued to do the segment.   The news organization had interviewed a woman who said he was responsible for the changing mugs.

She used a powerful spell that would reveal how good the dad's around the world actually were.   ust as the woman was about to explain the spell, she was interrupted by a mug that changed in her hand.
  She looked at the mug with disdain.  She said this was her father's mug.  She didn't show the number, but she seemed to agree with her father's ranking.

The news anchor was doing the story from a studio in New York and as soon as he started talking about the phenomenon, the mug on his desk changed to ""#500,000,000 Dad"".  He looked down at his mug and was startled a bit.  However, he was a professional and continued to do the segment.   The news organization had interviewed a woman who said he was responsible for the changing mugs.

She used a powerful spell that would reveal how good the dad's around the world actually were.   ust as the woman was about to explain the spell, she was interrupted by a mug that changed in her hand.
  She looked at the mug with disdain.  She said this was her father's mug.  She didn't show the number, but she seemed to agree with her father's ranking.

I have always thought I was a good dad.  My wife and I have been married for over 20 years and we have three beautiful children.  I was desperately curious to see what ranking my mug gave me.   I quietly walked to the kitchen.  Since I am the first one up every morning, I was alone while I was in the kitchen.  I started to open up the cabinet where I keep my mug.  Then, I paused.  What if I'm ranked ""1,000,000,001 Dad?"".  What if my ranking is absurdly low?  Is it worth it to torment myself.

After spending several minutes in thought, I had made a decision.  I closed my eyes and opened the cabinet.  I grabbed my mug and covered it with my hand.  I proceeded to dump it in the trash.   I had come to the conclusion that it would torment me if I looked at the mug.  I know that I try my hardest every day as a father.  I don't need a mug to tell me where I rank.
