""Yes I am!"" shouted Matt Damon, with his hands up in the air. ""I'm Matt Damon!""

""No, I'm Matt Damon!"" shouted the Matt Damon from the first tree. ""He's the one that kidnapped me! Please, ya gotta believe me!"" 
""I'm Matt Damon!"" shouted the Matt Damon from the second tree.
 ""I was kidnapped! Please, ya gotta believe me!""

Ben Affleck didn't know what to do. There wasn't enough time to think it out. He had to act quick. He drew his gun and shot the Matt Damon from the first tree.

There were people everywhere. They had dogs tracking his scent. They followed a trail where they could trace him. They were looking for him in the woods. They found his wallet. All of its contents were still inside, including cash. They found his shoes. And then they found the same pair of shoes again. How strange.  Why would he leave behind two pairs of shoes?
