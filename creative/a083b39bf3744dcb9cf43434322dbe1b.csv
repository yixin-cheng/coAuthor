You wonder if they are watching their own lives, or if they are watching yours.

Turning to the person nearest to you, you try to get their attention to ask. But they won't respond, and you aren't even sure if they hear or see you. Then you hear a voice. It's the voice of the cinema manager.

""You all try that. Every time. They won't answer by the way, not a one of them."" 
You turn to the cinema manager, who is sitting in the corner of the cinema.
 He's a small man, dressed impeccably, with a droll expression. You feel like he is hiding something.   
""So what are we doing here?"" you aask.
hHe smiled, ""And you all always ask that as well. Not a very creative bunch are you?""

You notice that he didn't answer your question, and you have a feeling that he won't be answering any of your questions. ""You're not here to help me, are you?""

The manager's grin had a sharp edge to it this time. ""Well, you are quicker than most on that point."" 

Feeling uneasy you look around again, taking in all of the people and the screen. Something catches your eye. The movie has looped, but it never showed how you died. 
""Why didn't you show me how I died?"" you ask.


The cinema manager's smile slipped a bit. ""I won't tell you that."" And then you realize you are actually a bit different than the others - they are pale, almost lifeless, but you still have energy, flushed cheeks, and most of all you realize your body is feeling something. Something that feels more and more like pain.

You wonder if they are watching their own lives, or if they are watching yours.

Turning to the person nearest to you, you try to get their attention to ask. But they won't respond, and you aren't even sure if they hear or see you. Then you hear a voice. It's the voice of the cinema manager.

You notice that he didn't answer your question, and you have a feeling that he won't be answering any of your questions. ""You're not here to help me, are you?""

The manager's grin had a sharp edge to it this time. ""Well, you are quicker than most on that point."" 

Feeling uneasy you look around again, taking in all of the people and the screen. Something catches your eye. The movie has looped, but it never showed how you died. 
""Why didn't you show me how I died?"" you ask.


The cinema manager's smile slipped a bit. ""I won't tell you that."" And then you realize you are actually a bit different than the others - they are pale, almost lifeless, but you still have energy, flushed cheeks, and most of all you realize your body is feeling something.

You turn to the cinema manager, who is sitting in the corner of the cinema.
 He's a small man, dressed impeccably, with a droll expression. You feel like he is hiding something.   
""So what are we doing here?"" you aask.
hHe smiled, ""And you all always ask that as well. Not a very creative bunch are you?""

You notice that he didn't answer your question, and you have a feeling that he won't be answering any of your questions. ""You're not here to help me, are you?""

The manager's grin had a sharp edge to it this time. ""Well, you are quicker than most on that point."" 

Feeling uneasy you look around again, taking in all of the people and the screen. Something catches your eye. The movie has looped, but it never showed how you died. 
""Why didn't you show me how I died?"" you ask.


The cinema manager's smile slipped a bit. ""I won't tell you that."" And then you realize you are actually a bit different than the others - they are pale, almost lifeless, but you still have energy, flushed cheeks, and most of all you realize your body is feeling something. Something that feels more and more like pain.

Turning to the person nearest to you, you try to get their attention to ask. But they won't respond, and you aren't even sure if they hear or see you. Then you hear a voice. It's the voice of the cinema manager.

""You all try that. Every time. They won't answer by the way, not a one of them."" 
You turn to the cinema manager, who is sitting in the corner of the cinema.
 He's a small man, dressed impeccably, with a droll expression. You feel like he is hiding something.   
""So what are we doing here?"" you aask.
hHe smiled, ""And you all always ask that as well. Not a very creative bunch are you?""

You notice that he didn't answer your question, and you have a feeling that he won't be answering any of your questions. ""You're not here to help me, are you?""

The manager's grin had a sharp edge to it this time. ""Well, you are quicker than most on that point."" 

Feeling uneasy you look around again, taking in all of the people and the screen. Something catches your eye. The movie has looped, but it never showed how you died. 
""Why didn't you show me how I died?"" you ask.


The cinema manager's smile slipped a bit. ""I won't tell you that."" And then you realize you are actually a bit different than the others - they are pale, almost lifeless, but you still have energy, flushed cheeks, and most of all you realize your body is feeling something. Something that feels more and more like pain.

Turning to the person nearest to you, you try to get their attention to ask. But they won't respond, and you aren't even sure if they hear or see you. Then you hear a voice. It's the voice of the cinema manager.

""You all try that. Every time. They won't answer by the way, not a one of them.""

 He's a small man, dressed impeccably, with a droll expression. You feel like he is hiding something.   
""So what are we doing here?"" you aask.

You notice that he didn't answer your question, and you have a feeling that he won't be answering any of your questions. ""You're not here to help me, are you?""

The manager's grin had a sharp edge to it this time. ""Well, you are quicker than most on that point."" 

Feeling uneasy you look around again, taking in all of the people and the screen. Something catches your eye. The movie has looped, but it never showed how you died. 
""Why didn't you show me how I died?"" you ask.


The cinema manager's smile slipped a bit. ""I won't tell you that."" And then you realize you are actually a bit different than the others - they are pale, almost lifeless, but you still have energy, flushed cheeks, and most of all you realize your body is feeling something. Something that feels more and more like pain. 
""I'm dying, aren't I?"" you ask.
 That made the manager grin. But then you decided.

Turning to the person nearest to you, you try to get their attention to ask. But they won't respond, and you aren't even sure if they hear or see you. Then you hear a voice. It's the voice of the cinema manager.

""You all try that. Every time. They won't answer by the way, not a one of them."" 
You turn to the cinema manager, who is sitting in the corner of the cinema.
 He's a small man, dressed impeccably, with a droll expression. You feel like he is hiding something.   
""So what are we doing here?"" you aask.
hHe smiled, ""And you all always ask that as well. Not a very creative bunch are you?""

You notice that he didn't answer your question, and you have a feeling that he won't be answering any of your questions. ""You're not here to help me, are you?""

The manager's grin had a sharp edge to it this time. ""Well, you are quicker than most on that point."" 

Feeling uneasy you look around again, taking in all of the people and the screen. Something catches your eye. The movie has looped, but it never showed how you died. 
""Why didn't you show me how I died?"" you ask.


The cinema manager's smile slipped a bit. ""I won't tell you that."" And then you realize you are actually a bit different than the others - they are pale, almost lifeless, but you still have energy, flushed cheeks, and most of all you realize your body is feeling something. Something that feels more and more like pain. 
""I'm dying, aren't I?"" you ask.
 That made the manager grin. But then you decided.

""But I'm not dead yet. And I'm not ready to die. I don't belong here yet, and I am leaving.""

You turn to the cinema manager, who is sitting in the corner of the cinema.
 He's a small man, dressed impeccably, with a droll expression. You feel like he is hiding something.

You notice that he didn't answer your question, and you have a feeling that he won't be answering any of your questions. ""You're not here to help me, are you?""

The manager's grin had a sharp edge to it this time. ""Well, you are quicker than most on that point."" 

Feeling uneasy you look around again, taking in all of the people and the screen. Something catches your eye. The movie has looped, but it never showed how you died.

The cinema manager's smile slipped a bit. ""I won't tell you that."" And then you realize you are actually a bit different than the others - they are pale, almost lifeless, but you still have energy, flushed cheeks, and most of all you realize your body is feeling something. Something that feels more and more like pain. 
""I'm dying, aren't I?"" you ask.
 That made the manager grin. But then you decided.

""But I'm not dead yet. And I'm not ready to die. I don't belong here yet, and I am leaving.""

""So what are we doing here?"" you aask.
hHe smiled, ""And you all always ask that as well. Not a very creative bunch are you?""

You notice that he didn't answer your question, and you have a feeling that he won't be answering any of your questions. ""You're not here to help me, are you?""

The manager's grin had a sharp edge to it this time. ""Well, you are quicker than most on that point."" 

Feeling uneasy you look around again, taking in all of the people and the screen. Something catches your eye. The movie has looped, but it never showed how you died. 
""Why didn't you show me how I died?"" you ask.


The cinema manager's smile slipped a bit. ""I won't tell you that."" And then you realize you are actually a bit different than the others - they are pale, almost lifeless, but you still have energy, flushed cheeks, and most of all you realize your body is feeling something. Something that feels more and more like pain. 
""I'm dying, aren't I?"" you ask.
 That made the manager grin. But then you decided.

""But I'm not dead yet. And I'm not ready to die. I don't belong here yet, and I am leaving.""

You notice that he didn't answer your question, and you have a feeling that he won't be answering any of your questions. ""You're not here to help me, are you?""

The manager's grin had a sharp edge to it this time. ""Well, you are quicker than most on that point."" 

Feeling uneasy you look around again, taking in all of the people and the screen. Something catches your eye. The movie has looped, but it never showed how you died. 
""Why didn't you show me how I died?"" you ask.


The cinema manager's smile slipped a bit. ""I won't tell you that."" And then you realize you are actually a bit different than the others - they are pale, almost lifeless, but you still have energy, flushed cheeks, and most of all you realize your body is feeling something. Something that feels more and more like pain. 
""I'm dying, aren't I?"" you ask.
 That made the manager grin. But then you decided.

""But I'm not dead yet. And I'm not ready to die. I don't belong here yet, and I am leaving.""

You turn to the cinema manager, who is sitting in the corner of the cinema.
 He's a small man, dressed impeccably, with a droll expression. You feel like he is hiding something.

And then you realize you are actually a bit different than the others - they are pale, almost lifeless, but you still have energy, flushed cheeks, and most of all you realize your body is feeling something.

 That made the manager grin. But then you decided.

""But I'm not dead yet. And I'm not ready to die. I don't belong here yet, and I am leaving.""

Turning to the person nearest to you, you try to get their attention to ask. But they won't respond, and you aren't even sure if they hear or see you. Then you hear a voice. It's the voice of the cinema manager.

""You all try that. Every time. They won't answer by the way, not a one of them."" 
You turn to the cinema manager, who is sitting in the corner of the cinema.
 He's a small man, dressed impeccably, with a droll expression. You feel like he is hiding something.   
""So what are we doing here?"" you aask.
hHe smiled, ""And you all always ask that as well. Not a very creative bunch are you?""

You notice that he didn't answer your question, and you have a feeling that he won't be answering any of your questions. ""You're not here to help me, are you?""

The manager's grin had a sharp edge to it this time. ""Well, you are quicker than most on that point."" 

Feeling uneasy you look around again, taking in all of the people and the screen. Something catches your eye. The movie has looped, but it never showed how you died. 
""Why didn't you show me how I died?"" you ask.


The cinema manager's smile slipped a bit. ""I won't tell you that."" And then you realize you are actually a bit different than the others - they are pale, almost lifeless, but you still have energy, flushed cheeks, and most of all you realize your body is feeling something. Something that feels more and more like pain. 
""I'm dying, aren't I?"" you ask.
 That made the manager grin. But then you decided.

""But I'm not dead yet. And I'm not ready to die. I don't belong here yet, and I am leaving.""

You stride towards the exit, feeling the manager glaring daggers into your back, but he doesn't move to stop you. As you walk through the door you suddenly remember the accident, and then the pain hits you. And you are lying on your back hearing paramedics shouting",2307,[],1,4,5,30,0.3,1,0,0,1956

Turning to the person nearest to you, you try to get their attention to ask. But they won't respond, and you aren't even sure if they hear or see you. Then you hear a voice. It's the voice of the cinema manager.

""You all try that. Every time. They won't answer by the way, not a one of them."" 
You turn to the cinema manager, who is sitting in the corner of the cinema.
 He's a small man, dressed impeccably, with a droll expression. You feel like he is hiding something.   
""So what are we doing here?"" you aask.
hHe smiled, ""And you all always ask that as well. Not a very creative bunch are you?""

You notice that he didn't answer your question, and you have a feeling that he won't be answering any of your questions. ""You're not here to help me, are you?""

The manager's grin had a sharp edge to it this time. ""Well, you are quicker than most on that point."" 

Feeling uneasy you look around again, taking in all of the people and the screen. Something catches your eye. The movie has looped, but it never showed how you died. 
""Why didn't you show me how I died?"" you ask.


The cinema manager's smile slipped a bit. ""I won't tell you that."" And then you realize you are actually a bit different than the others - they are pale, almost lifeless, but you still have energy, flushed cheeks, and most of all you realize your body is feeling something. Something that feels more and more like pain. 
""I'm dying, aren't I?"" you ask.
 That made the manager grin. But then you decided.

""But I'm not dead yet. And I'm not ready to die. I don't belong here yet, and I am leaving.""

You stride towards the exit, feeling the manager glaring daggers into your back, but he doesn't move to stop you.

You turn to the cinema manager, who is sitting in the corner of the cinema.
 He's a small man, dressed impeccably, with a droll expression. You feel like he is hiding something.   
""So what are we doing here?"" you aask.
hHe smiled, ""And you all always ask that as well. Not a very creative bunch are you?""

You notice that he didn't answer your question, and you have a feeling that he won't be answering any of your questions. ""You're not here to help me, are you?""

The manager's grin had a sharp edge to it this time. ""Well, you are quicker than most on that point."" 

Feeling uneasy you look around again, taking in all of the people and the screen. Something catches your eye. The movie has looped, but it never showed how you died. 
""Why didn't you show me how I died?"" you ask.


The cinema manager's smile slipped a bit. ""I won't tell you that."" And then you realize you are actually a bit different than the others - they are pale, almost lifeless, but you still have energy, flushed cheeks, and most of all you realize your body is feeling something. Something that feels more and more like pain. 
""I'm dying, aren't I?"" you ask.
 That made the manager grin. But then you decided.

""But I'm not dead yet. And I'm not ready to die. I don't belong here yet, and I am leaving.""

You stride towards the exit, feeling the manager glaring daggers into your back, but he doesn't move to stop you.

And then you realize you are actually a bit different than the others - they are pale, almost lifeless, but you still have energy, flushed cheeks, and most of all you realize your body is feeling something. Something that feels more and more like pain. 
""I'm dying, aren't I?"" you ask.
 That made the manager grin. But then you decided.

""But I'm not dead yet. And I'm not ready to die. I don't belong here yet, and I am leaving.""

You stride towards the exit, feeling the manager glaring daggers into your back, but he doesn't move to stop you. As you walk through the door you suddenly remember the accident, and then the pain hits you. And you are lying on your back hearing paramedics shouting and moving you to a stretcher.
