Your best friend doesn't have any kids with Kaitlyn, but now you are certain that he is Harper's father. You realize that you have been absolutely used and cheated on. You are disgusted with Soeurette. You throw the mug against the wall and it shatters. Soeurette comes to ask you what's wrong and you tell her you know that she cheated on you and that Harper is not your child. She denies it at first, but you are able to prove to her that you have figured everything out. She breaks down and confesses her sins. She begs you to try and forgive her. She tells you that she loves you and that she still wants to be with you. You think to yourself, ""how can I stay with this woman who has cheated on me and used me?"" You kick Soeurette out of your life and let her fend for herself as a single mom to Harper. She lives a very miserable and unhappy life after that and is never able to find another man willing to trust her. She dies alone, isolated, and penniless.",2825,[],0,0,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,2138
