 Amy is only 26 herself, so she and her charges are candidates for immortality. The children's parents, Tim and Jim however, are not. Tim and Jim know exactly the path to be taken in raising their children. Who will see to it that the children stay on the right path should Tim and Jim die of old age? Amy thinks this is selfish of the parents. The children will be able to care for themselves and will make their own way eventually. What the parents do not know is that the government is not giving people a choice.


Tim and Jim decide, with the help of Amy, to live off the grid. They will not allow the government to use their precious offspring as guinea pigs. Amy agrees, somewhat. She thinks that staying away from the mainstream will give her two years to observe side effects. If they are a nightmare, she will simply stay off the grid. Amy loves the little ones for whom she cares. She could be happy always being in their life. In fact, it is ideal for children to have two loving parents, and a fun, creative and loving governess.

 Amy is only 26 herself, so she and her charges are candidates for immortality. The children's parents, Tim and Jim however, are not. Tim and Jim know exactly the path to be taken in raising their children. Who will see to it that the children stay on the right path should Tim and Jim die of old age? Amy thinks this is selfish of the parents. The children will be able to care for themselves and will make their own way eventually. What the parents do not know is that the government is not giving people a choice.


Tim and Jim decide, with the help of Amy, to live off the grid. They will not allow the government to use their precious offspring as guinea pigs. Amy agrees, somewhat. She thinks that staying away from the mainstream will give her two years to observe side effects. If they are a nightmare, she will simply stay off the grid. Amy loves the little ones for whom she cares. She could be happy always being in their life. In fact, it is ideal for children to have two loving parents, and a fun, creative and loving governess. This just might turn out okay, afterall.
