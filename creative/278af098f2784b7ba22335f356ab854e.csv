""Why was I punished? What did I do?"" I asked.

""Well, you did something that was very... unbee-lievable."" said Buzz jokingly. ""When you were a kid, you were playing with your friends in the garden and you cut a bee hive to fall from a tree."" continued Buzz.

""I did that as a bee?"" I asked confusingly.

""Yes, your Majesty. You've been banished from the bee kingdom at an early age and you have been turned into a human as a punishment."" Buzz said.

""Why was I punished? What did I do?"" I asked.

""Well, you did something that was very... unbee-lievable."" said Buzz jokingly. ""When you were a kid, you were playing with your friends in the garden and you cut a bee hive to fall from a tree."" continued Buzz.

""I did that as a bee?"" I asked confusingly. 

""You really don't remember, huh?"" Buzz said. ""Well now, our queen died years ago and you're next in line to be queen. We've been trying to get you for years!"" revealed Buzz.

""But how can I even lead you as a queen?"" I asked. ""I'm human!""

""Well, can say your orders every now and then,"" said Buzz. ""Our new bee hive is just outside of your house.""

""Well, okay then."" I said. ""I guess I'm your new queen.""

""I did that as a bee?"" I asked confusingly. 

""You really don't remember, huh?"" Buzz said. ""Well now, our queen died years ago and you're next in line to be queen. We've been trying to get you for years!"" revealed Buzz.

""But how can I even lead you as a queen?"" I asked. ""I'm human!""

""Well, can say your orders every now and then,"" said Buzz. ""Our new bee hive is just outside of your house.""
