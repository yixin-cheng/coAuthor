The walls are padded.  You check the door and it is locked.  You check the windows and they are barred. You're trapped.  Luckily, you still have your cyanide pill with you.  You slip it into your mouth and die moments later.  Nobody's gonna get that information out of you now.

You arrive at the location and see a man in a black suit, white shirt, and black tie.
  It's a man in black!  He raised a tool up in the air and shined you in the face with a bright light.  You're blinded and disoriented.  You were whisked away in handcuffs into a van.
