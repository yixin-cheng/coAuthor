Startled, you sit up and look around you, the seats are all empty. Every past you is gone. Then you look down and see a big black book, with your name on it.

The lights turn back off, the book disappears and a door opens next to the screen and a bright light shines from within. You walk towards the light and decide that you are going to make some different decisions this time around, ones that will ensure a better future, one where you live longer and learn from your past mistakes.

 There are clearly issues with future self's decision making abilities. When you would have turned right, they turned left. When you would have stopped, they continue forward. They also appear to be missing some very important information. Mainly, the ability to make a decision before missing a great opportunity!

You glance at the past versions of you seated throughout the theatre , and you see them shaking their heads in disgust at the decisions future self is making, which if nothing else, makes you feel a little more comfortable with your opinions. 

""Is it always like this?"" you ask previous you seated beside you.
""Yes and no, we've had some real dopes in the past."" ""But you've had some great ones as well.?
 You gesture towards yourself. 
Laughter can be heard from several seats away, making you cringe. ""We have, but we've also been some real dopes ourselves!""


After what feels like days of watching the screen, you start to realize that time is moving at a different speed now. Somehow at some point, without you ever knowing, the theatre has at least 6 more you's. You realize that since being seated you have watched 6 generations of your life pass you by, from birth to death.

s. The current future self is a number of years older than you were at the end of your life. You are about to say something to the previous self that was next to you when the screen in front of you turns black and the lights come back on.

Startled, you sit up and look around you, the seats are all empty. Every past you is gone. Then you look down and see a big black book, with your name on it. You pick up the book, turn to the first page and in a large font it states very simply, ""If you do not change the decisions you make, you will suffer the same fate as your previous selves.""

The lights turn back off, the book disappears and a door opens next to the screen and a bright light shines from within. You walk towards the light and decide that you are going to make some different decisions this time around, ones that will ensure a better future, one where you live longer and learn from your past mistakes. This is it.
