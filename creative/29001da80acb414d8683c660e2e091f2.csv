He had built a massive underground bunker, with a maze of tunnels that he could use to escape from any predator should they try to break into his house. The bunker was well hidden, fortified, and stocked, able to sustain him if the predators were to break into his above home. He would often leave his house unlocked at night, while he slept underground in his bunker, to fool predators into thinking the home was already abadoned.

For you see, the 20th little pig built a house in a distant and hidden part of a forest, made up of bricks and mortar, and it was strong enough to withstand the forces of nature. However, unlike his siblings who had also built houses sturdy enough to stand against harsh winds and natural disasters, the 20th little pig had devised a way to avoid predators. He had built a massive underground bunker, with a maze of tunnels that he could use to escape from any predator should they try to break into his house. The bunker was well hidden, fortified, and stocked, able to sustain him if the predators were to break into his above home. He would often leave his house unlocked at night, while he slept underground in his bunker, to fool predators into thinking the home was already abandoned. Sure enough, predators eventually gave up on the house of the 20th little pig. The 20th little pig was able to live a long life free from predator, and when he died he left his home to his children.

However, unlike his siblings who had also built houses sturdy enough to stand against harsh winds and natural disasters, the 20th little pig had devised a way to avoid predators. He had built a massive underground bunker, with a maze of tunnels that he could use to escape from any predator should they try to break into his house.

He would often leave his house unlocked at night, while he slept underground in his bunker, to fool predators into thinking the home was already abandoned.

However, unlike his siblings who had also built houses sturdy enough to stand against harsh winds and natural disasters, the 20th little pig had devised a way to avoid predators. He had built a massive underground bunker, with a maze of tunnels that he could use to escape from any predator should they try to break into his house. The bunker was well hidden, fortified, and stocked, able to sustain him if the predators were to break into his above home. He would often leave his house unlocked at night, while he slept underground in his bunker, to fool predators into thinking the home was already abandoned.

However, unlike his siblings who had also built houses sturdy enough to stand against harsh winds and natural disasters, the 20th little pig had devised a way to avoid predators. He had built a massive underground bunker, with a maze of tunnels that he could use to escape from any predator should they try to break into his house. The bunker was well hidden, fortified, and stocked, able to sustain him if the predators were to break into his above home. He would often leave his house unlocked at night, while he slept underground in his bunker, to fool predators into thinking the home was already abandoned.

However, unlike his siblings who had also built houses sturdy enough to stand against harsh winds and natural disasters, the 20th little pig had devised a way to avoid predators. He had built a massive underground bunker, with a maze of tunnels that he could use to escape from any predator should they try to break into his house. The bunker was well hidden, fortified, and stocked, able to sustain him if the predators were to break into his above home. He would often leave his house unlocked at night, while he slept underground in his bunker, to fool predators into thinking the home was already abandoned. Sure enough, predators eventually gave up on the house of the 20th little pig. The 20th little pig was able to live a long life free from the threat of predators, and when he died he left his home to his children.

For you see, the 20th little pig built a house in a distant and hidden part of a forest, made up of bricks and mortar, and it was strong enough to withstand the forces of nature. However, unlike his siblings who had also built houses sturdy enough to stand against harsh winds and natural disasters, the 20th little pig had devised a way to avoid predators. He had built a massive underground bunker, with a maze of tunnels that he could use to escape from any predator should they try to break into his house. The bunker was well hidden, fortified, and stocked, able to sustain him if the predators were to break into his above home. He would often leave his house unlocked at night, while he slept underground in his bunker, to fool predators into thinking the home was already abandoned. Sure enough, predators eventually gave up on the house of the 20th little pig. 

The 20th little pig was able to live a long life free from the threat of predators, and when he died he left his home to his children. They would keep his legacy alive, and continue to live in the house, and the bunker, that he had built. For unlike his siblings, he would still be alive like his descendants, who expanded his underground bunker. They would form a community of pigs, who would call themselves, ""The Bunker Pigs""
