They just say that Dad, you're not the best dad. hey tell you they love you, and that everything is fine, but it's really not.

 You need to be the better dad. You know you can't be the best in the world, the proof is right there. But, you CAN be the #8675309th best dad in the world if you try hard enough!

You sit your kids down and ask them how you can help them, what have you done wrong, how have you hurt them? They don't have any one major issue with you, not one big glaring flaw. They just say that Dad, you're not the best dad. hey tell you they love you, and that everything is fine, but it's really not.

 You need to be the better dad. You know you can't be the best in the world, the proof is right there. But, you CAN be the #8675309th best dad in the world if you try hard enough!

They just say that Dad, you're not the best dad. hey tell you they love you, and that everything is fine, but it's really not.
