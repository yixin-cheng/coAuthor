You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand. Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder.

When I first heard the bee talk, I wasn't sure who or what the sound was coming from.  I looked around, but I didn't see anyone so I kept walking through the park.  ""Your majesty.  Down here.  On your shoulder"", the bee said.  I looked down to see a bee in, what looked to be, a tiny red coat with golden buttons on it.  ""Did I just take a journey to Narnia right now?  Is Aslan going to pop out somewhere?"", I said.  

""No, your majesty.  Aslan isn't concerned with earth right now.  He has other matters to attend to.  The bees need your help"", the bee said.      ""What do you mean, the bees need my help?"", I said.  ""Well, every 50 years, the honey bees will seek out the descendent of King Noram.  Noram was a human who helped out bees to a great extent generations ago.    ""Noram cast a spell that helped the bees survive while the world around us crumbled"", the bee said.
