""I'm going to die,"" you think.
 The bee crawls down your arms, to your hand, and then on to the table. You could swear it's looking up at you.

 You can't believe your ears. 
""I'm not the queen,"" you say, ""I'm just a girl.""

"" ""Your mother is dying, and sent me here to help you escape"" 
""My mother is fine,"" you say, ""I just saw her."" She was going to the market with a friend.""  ""That is not your mother, My queen. That is a consort of wasps.""

 ""No"" The bee says. ""You are not allergic to bees. That is a lie your mother has told you.

""Where did that voice come from?"" you wonder. There's no radio or phone nearby, and you're sitting by yourself in the garden.  Your mother usually never let you outside or out of her sight, but today, she was out visiting a friend She had locked the bedroom door, but being a clever girl, you knew how to get out, into the forbidden outdoors. 

Then you feel the bee on your shoulder, its tiny feet clinging to the fabric of your shirt. A thousand thoughts flash through your mind. ""If one touches your skin, you will die,"" your mother had warned. She had smashed any bee, keeping them away from landing on you. 
""I'm going to die,"" you think.
 The bee crawls down your arms, to your hand, and then on to the table. You could swear it's looking up at you. 
Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" it asks again.
 You can't believe your ears. 
""I'm not the queen,"" you say, ""I'm just a girl.""
 
You are the queen, my Queen,"" the bee says, ""and I am your loyal servant.
"" ""Your mother is dying, and sent me here to help you escape"" 
""My mother is fine,"" you say, ""I just saw her."" She was going to the market with a friend.""  ""That is not your mother, My queen. That is a consort of wasps."" The bee explains, ""They have taken over your mother's body and mind. Your true mother is in the woods near here, safe, with the rest of the honeybee hive!"" 
""But I can't leave,"" you say, ""I'm allergic to bees.""
 ""No"" The bee says. ""You are not allergic to bees. That is a lie your mother has told you.
She is a wasp, and she has lied to you all your life.
"" 

With all of this new information, you sit down, overwhelmed. You must decide if you want to believe the little talking bee. 
""I need time to think,"" you tell the bee. ""I will give you time,"" the bee says, ""but remember, you are the queen.
 And with that he flies off.
