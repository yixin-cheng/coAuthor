Now it is guaranteed that the old will live forever, and the young will be there to serve them according to whatever their sick, sometimes senile, whims may be.

You, and some of the other ""Lost Generation"" members see this for the atrocity it is, and you try to stop it. You put your own complaint scientists to work developing yet another drug, that will negate all the effects of the previously developed serum.
