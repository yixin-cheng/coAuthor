Helena thinks, ""I have been so scared that I’m going to get hurt.
 I am afraid to let myself feel. It’s time to wake up and let someone love me the way I love them. I’ve got to be strong and brave.""  

Helena resolves to give her next date a fair chance.  She will allow herself to love. She meets a handsome man, Ben, at a coffee shop. Her newfound resolve empowers her, and they hit it off.

 She says to herself, ""Oh my goodness. I am dating the same guy over and over again.” Suddenly, she has the key to her problem. She can see it so clearly. She realizes that the problem is her. She has a fear of trusting her heart and letting another person in. She’s afraid that he will hurt her and not love her back like she loves him.
Helena realizes it’s time for her to open herself up and trust again.
 She has to let a man in emotionally and, for the first time, be vulnerable. She has to learn to love herself before she can let anyone else in and be happy.
Helena thinks, ""I have been so scared that I’m going to get hurt.
 I am afraid to let myself feel. It’s time to wake up and let someone love me the way I love them. I’ve got to be strong and brave.""  

Helena resolves to give her next date a fair chance.  She will allow herself to love. She meets a handsome man, Ben, at a coffee shop. Her newfound resolve empowers her, and they hit it off. 
 She feels a weird energy. 
She lets her guard down and feels the first stirrings of a love she never thought possible.
