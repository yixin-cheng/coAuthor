She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

One day, as she emerges from the kitchen she catches something strange happening with her latest guy's face. She’s not sure what she’s seeing, but she’s pretty sure she doesn’t like it.  She thought there for a moment that she was looking at her previous boyfriend.  She shook her head.  ""Well, probably a good idea if I stick to having just the one glass of wine with dinner"" she thought to herself.

The next day at work she mentions the event to her friend and co-worker Stella.  Stella thinks that she's one, been working too hard and two, except for their looks this one and all the ones before all seem to be the same to her.  She asks if there's been recent trouble between them, something that reminded her of the previous boyfriend.  The woman says there hasn't been any trouble, but she's not sure.  Thinking back she realizes the relationship is pretty much a mirror of all her relationships.  She wonders if that is why when she was looking at him the other night she thought she saw a resemblance.

Stella says maybe she should take a break from both work and this latest guy.  Book a vacation in a faraway peaceful place and put both work and romance on the backburner for a while.  ""Wouldn't want to end up in the looney bin"" Stella says.

She thought there for a moment that she was looking at her previous boyfriend.  She shook her head.  ""Well, probably a good idea if I stick to having just the one glass of wine with dinner"" she thought to herself.

The next day at work she mentions the event to her friend and co-worker Stella.  Stella thinks that she's one, been working too hard and two, except for their looks this one and all the ones before all seem to be the same to her.  She asks if there's been recent trouble between them, something that reminded her of the previous boyfriend.  The woman says there hasn't been any trouble, but she's not sure.  Thinking back she realizes the relationship is pretty much a mirror of all her relationships.  She wonders if that is why when she was looking at him the other night she thought she saw a resemblance.

Stella says maybe she should take a break from both work and this latest guy.  Book a vacation in a faraway peaceful place and put both work and romance on the backburner for a while.  ""Wouldn't want to end up in the looney bin"" Stella says.

Thinking back she realizes the relationship is pretty much a mirror of all her relationships.  She wonders if that is why when she was looking at him the other night she thought she saw a resemblance.

Stella thinks that she's one, been working too hard and two, except for their looks this one and all the ones before all seem to be the same to her.  She asks if there's been recent trouble between them, something that reminded her of the previous boyfriend.  The woman says there hasn't been any trouble, but she's not sure.  Thinking back she realizes the relationship is pretty much a mirror of all her relationships.  She wonders if that is why when she was looking at him the other night she thought she saw a resemblance.

She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

One day, as she emerges from the kitchen she catches something strange happening with her latest guy's face. She’s not sure what she’s seeing, but she’s pretty sure she doesn’t like it.  She thought there for a moment that she was looking at her previous boyfriend.  She shook her head.  ""Well, probably a good idea if I stick to having just the one glass of wine with dinner"" she thought to herself.

The next day at work she mentions the event to her friend and co-worker Stella.  Stella thinks that she's one, been working too hard and two, except for their looks this one and all the ones before all seem to be the same to her.  She asks if there's been recent trouble between them, something that reminded her of the previous boyfriend.  The woman says there hasn't been any trouble, but she's not sure.  Thinking back she realizes the relationship is pretty much a mirror of all her relationships.  She wonders if that is why when she was looking at him the other night she thought she saw a resemblance.

Stella says maybe she should take a break from both work and this latest guy.  Book a vacation in a faraway peaceful place and put both work and romance on the backburner for a while.  ""Wouldn't want to end up in the looney bin"" Stella says.

he woman agrees.

She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

One day, as she emerges from the kitchen she catches something strange happening with her latest guy's face. She’s not sure what she’s seeing, but she’s pretty sure she doesn’t like it.  She thought there for a moment that she was looking at her previous boyfriend.  She shook her head.  ""Well, probably a good idea if I stick to having just the one glass of wine with dinner"" she thought to herself.

The next day at work she mentions the event to her friend and co-worker Stella.  Stella thinks that she's one, been working too hard and two, except for their looks this one and all the ones before all seem to be the same to her.  She asks if there's been recent trouble between them, something that reminded her of the previous boyfriend.  The woman says there hasn't been any trouble, but she's not sure.  Thinking back she realizes the relationship is pretty much a mirror of all her relationships.  She wonders if that is why when she was looking at him the other night she thought she saw a resemblance.

Stella says maybe she should take a break from both work and this latest guy.  Book a vacation in a faraway peaceful place and put both work and romance on the backburner for a while.  ""Wouldn't want to end up in the looney bin"" Stella says.

he woman agrees.

Maybe one of those 'experience' type vacations where you learn some obscure handicraft or skill.

She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

One day, as she emerges from the kitchen she catches something strange happening with her latest guy's face. She’s not sure what she’s seeing, but she’s pretty sure she doesn’t like it.  She thought there for a moment that she was looking at her previous boyfriend.  She shook her head.  ""Well, probably a good idea if I stick to having just the one glass of wine with dinner"" she thought to herself.

The next day at work she mentions the event to her friend and co-worker Stella.  Stella thinks that she's one, been working too hard and two, except for their looks this one and all the ones before all seem to be the same to her.  She asks if there's been recent trouble between them, something that reminded her of the previous boyfriend.  The woman says there hasn't been any trouble, but she's not sure.  Thinking back she realizes the relationship is pretty much a mirror of all her relationships.  She wonders if that is why when she was looking at him the other night she thought she saw a resemblance.

Stella says maybe she should take a break from both work and this latest guy.  Book a vacation in a faraway peaceful place and put both work and romance on the backburner for a while.  ""Wouldn't want to end up in the looney bin"" Stella says.

Maybe one of those 'experience' type vacations where you learn some obscure handicraft or skill.  The travel agent offers up a convent experience where you can nurse the lepers on a small remote island.  She nixes that one right off the bat.

One day, as she emerges from the kitchen she catches something strange happening with her latest guy's face. She’s not sure what she’s seeing, but she’s pretty sure she doesn’t like it.  She thought there for a moment that she was looking at her previous boyfriend.  She shook her head.  ""Well, probably a good idea if I stick to having just the one glass of wine with dinner"" she thought to herself.

The next day at work she mentions the event to her friend and co-worker Stella.  Stella thinks that she's one, been working too hard and two, except for their looks this one and all the ones before all seem to be the same to her.  She asks if there's been recent trouble between them, something that reminded her of the previous boyfriend.  The woman says there hasn't been any trouble, but she's not sure.  Thinking back she realizes the relationship is pretty much a mirror of all her relationships.  She wonders if that is why when she was looking at him the other night she thought she saw a resemblance.

Stella says maybe she should take a break from both work and this latest guy.  Book a vacation in a faraway peaceful place and put both work and romance on the backburner for a while.  ""Wouldn't want to end up in the looney bin"" Stella says.

She asks if there's been recent trouble between them, something that reminded her of the previous boyfriend.  The woman says there hasn't been any trouble, but she's not sure.  Thinking back she realizes the relationship is pretty much a mirror of all her relationships.  She wonders if that is why when she was looking at him the other night she thought she saw a resemblance.

Stella says maybe she should take a break from both work and this latest guy.  Book a vacation in a faraway peaceful place and put both work and romance on the backburner for a while.  ""Wouldn't want to end up in the looney bin"" Stella says.

One day, as she emerges from the kitchen she catches something strange happening with her latest guy's face. She’s not sure what she’s seeing, but she’s pretty sure she doesn’t like it.

She asks if there's been recent trouble between them, something that reminded her of the previous boyfriend.  The woman says there hasn't been any trouble, but she's not sure.  Thinking back she realizes the relationship is pretty much a mirror of all her relationships.  She wonders if that is why when she was looking at him the other night she thought she saw a resemblance.

She wonders if that is why when she was looking at him the other night she thought she saw a resemblance.

""Well, probably a good idea if I stick to having just the one glass of wine with dinner"" she thought to herself.

The next day at work she mentions the event to her friend and co-worker Stella.  Stella thinks that she's one, been working too hard and two, except for their looks this one and all the ones before all seem to be the same to her.  She asks if there's been recent trouble between them, something that reminded her of the previous boyfriend.  The woman says there hasn't been any trouble, but she's not sure.  Thinking back she realizes the relationship is pretty much a mirror of all her relationships.  She wonders if that is why when she was looking at him the other night she thought she saw a resemblance.

Stella says maybe she should take a break from both work and this latest guy.  Book a vacation in a faraway peaceful place and put both work and romance on the backburner for a while.  ""Wouldn't want to end up in the looney bin"" Stella says.

he woman agrees.
  She puts a call in to her travel agent and tells her what she wants.  In fact she tells her she'd like an all-female excursion if such a thing exists.  Maybe one of those 'experience' type vacations where you learn some obscure handicraft or skill.  The travel agent offers up a convent experience where you can nurse the lepers on a small remote island.  She nixes that one right off the bat.  Dealing with weeping sores and a contagious disease seems worse than what she wants to leave behind.  She asks if there isn't something like picking flowers, making perfume, throwing pottery, something well, not too hard, not dangerous and also pleasant.  The travel agent says she'll work on it.

Thinking back she realizes the relationship is pretty much a mirror of all her relationships.  She wonders if that is why when she was looking at him the other night she thought she saw a resemblance.

Stella says maybe she should take a break from both work and this latest guy.  Book a vacation in a faraway peaceful place and put both work and romance on the backburner for a while.  ""Wouldn't want to end up in the looney bin"" Stella says.
