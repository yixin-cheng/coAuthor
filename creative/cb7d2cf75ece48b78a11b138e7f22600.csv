In human history on earth, there have been only 100 humans who could wield mana.  Some of them became kings.  Other went mad due to the power that they held.  And a few were able to use their power for the greater good.   Wielding mana was a double-edged sword.  For that reason, many human beings in the past were afraid of this ancient power.

Now, human beings look to mana as their liberator.  The hostile aliens that attacked earth have led a ruthless campaign to exterminate humans on this planet.  Rumors about mana arose after the aliens went on their rampage.   It was believed that humans would be able to turn the tables on their enemy.   

In order to wield mana, you had to be descended from someone who could wield mana.  If you had any chance to wield this force, it would happen around your 31st birthday.  So many people were being killed that many people never made it to their 31st birthday.   Thankfully, Caerus survived to her 31st birthday.     

Caerus was descended from the first, rumored mana user.  When Caerus turned 31, she remarked that she started to feel an intense heat inside of her.  It looked like she had come down with a terrible sickness.  On her birthday, a fever overtook her.  She laid in her bed until she had to urge to run outside.   When she did, her hands started to glow with a sort of heat.  Instinctively, she threw her hands to the sky and yet out a piercing scream.   Red energy flowed into the sky.  It seemed to reach the heavens.

In human history on earth, there have been only 100 humans who could wield mana.  Some of them became kings.  Other went mad due to the power that they held.  And a few were able to use their power for the greater good.   Wielding mana was a double-edged sword.  For that reason, many human beings in the past were afraid of this ancient power.

When she did, her hands started to glow with a sort of heat.  Instinctively, she threw her hands to the sky and yet out a piercing scream.   Red energy flowed into the sky.  It seemed to reach the heavens.

In human history on earth, there have been only 100 humans who could wield mana.  Some of them became kings.  Other went mad due to the power that they held.  And a few were able to use their power for the greater good.   Wielding mana was a double-edged sword.  For that reason, many human beings in the past were afraid of this ancient power.

When she did, her hands started to glow with a sort of heat.  Instinctively, she threw her hands to the sky and yet out a piercing scream.   Red energy flowed into the sky.  It seemed to reach the heavens.

Little did the people around her know, Caerus had sped up the awakening of those who could wield mana.  Throughout the world, the descendants of mana wielders were overcome with their awakenings.  They filled the sky with red energy.  For the human bein",2012,[],0,3,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,2721

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.

In human history on earth, there have been only 100 humans who could wield mana.  Some of them became kings.  Other went mad due to the power that they held.

When she did, her hands started to glow with a sort of heat.  Instinctively, she threw her hands to the sky and yet out a piercing scream.   Red energy flowed into the sky.  It seemed to reach the stratosphere

Little did the people around her know, Caerus had sped up the awakening of those who could wield mana.  Throughout the world, the descendants of mana wielders were overcome with their awakenings.  They filled the sky with red energy.   This",2003,[],0,4,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,2778

It seemed to reach the stratosphere

Little did the people around her know, Caerus had sped up the awakening of those who could wield mana.  Throughout the world, the descendants of mana wielders were overcome with their awakenings.  They filled the sky with red energy.   This would be the ",2017,[],0,4,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,2806

In human history on earth, there have been only 100 humans who could wield mana.  Some of them became kings.  Other went mad due to the power that they held.  And a few were able to use their power for the greater good.   Wielding mana was a double-edged sword.  For that reason, many human beings in the past were afraid of this ancient power.

It seemed to reach the stratosphere

In human history on earth, there have been only 100 humans who could wield mana.  Some of them became kings.  Other went mad due to the power that they held.  And a few were able to use their power for the greater good.   Wielding mana was a double-edged sword.  For that reason, many human beings in the past were afraid of this ancient power.

It looked like she had come down with a terrible sickness.  On her birthday, a fever overtook her.  She laid in her bed until she had to urge to run outside.   When she did, her hands started to glow with a sort of heat.  Instinctively, she threw her hands to the sky and yet out a piercing scream.   Red energy flowed into the sky.  It seemed to reach the stratosphere

Little did the people around her know, Caerus had sped up the awakening of those who could wield mana.  Throughout the world, the descendants of mana wielders were overcome with their awakenings.
