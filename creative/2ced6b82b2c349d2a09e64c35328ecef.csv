It was hardly surprising, he was not present most of the time when I was growing up, and still today he still has very little relationship with my 2-year old son, Toby. Over the years I tried to spend more time with him but he always found some excuse to avoid spending time with me, especially recently and I am writing this from a hotel room in England, where I am on. I specifically flew here in my hometown to visit him but he just doesn't want to. I asked him what is his reaction about the mug thing and he just said, ""I don't care.""

I don't know if he means that he doesn't care about the mug, or he doesn't care about being a father. I was very angry about the mug thing but I realize that it wouldn't do any good. My husband's dad also showed up around the bottom of the list, with just a few million separating him from my dad, but his relationship with my husband and with our kid is getting better.

I just wish me and my dad is the same. There are so many stories that I want to tell about Toby. Last week, he just started to say ""I love you"" and now he does it 24/7. I was also trying to train him in the potty and after a day he already knows what to do. I wanted to day that he reminds me of his grandpa. But I won't give him that satisfaction. I know for a fact that my father does not even know when Toby's birthday is. I had to call him a week later after Toby was born to give him the news. He wasn't even excited. All he said at the time was, ""Oh, well, that is nice.""
