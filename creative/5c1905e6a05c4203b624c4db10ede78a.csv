While the United States was in isolation, the country fended for itself.  It didn't import or export any goods.  The US made do with the goods and services that it had within the country.   The United States was forced to learn to live without the luxuries that it had become accustomed to.  The country also didn't communicate with anyone outside of the US.   

When the first Americans left isolation, they were shocked at the advancements of the other countries.  America's technology regressed while it was in isolation.  It ran out of the resources that it needed to make modern, at that time, technology.   On the other hand, the other countries' technology had by leaps and bounds.  

Every major country now had a well-developed space program.  This space program allowed these countries to harvest the resources in our solar system.  One of those resources is a resource called helium-3.  Helium-3 is a non-radioactive isotope that allowed countries to utilize nuclear energy without the fear of nuclear waste.   This meant that every person in these countries had access to plentiful energy.  They didn't have to worry about a home without heat or electricity.

The main reason why the other countries advanced so quickly was due to the exchange of information.  After World War III, the countries who didn't isolate focused on the exchange of good and useful technical information.   This allowed them to advance much faster than the United States.
