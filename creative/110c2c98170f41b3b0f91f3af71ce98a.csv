The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" ""Do you have any idea how wealthy you all could be living inside all of that uranium?"" The pigs knew the uranium was no longer radioactive, but it was still really strong and they were formulating an idea in their little piggy minds.

That place being their uranium fortress. 
The wolves, they didn't know it yet, but the little pigs had been watching them.
 The pigs knew of the wealth the wolves had accumulated from eating weaker animals and then taking their fortunes for their own use. This angered the pigs, and many small animal all over the globe.

The wolves were shown to their rooms, and they began to make themselves comfortable.
 They were fed luscious meals, made from fake meat, and given all the treatment royalty would expect.
