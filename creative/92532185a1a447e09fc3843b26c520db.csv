The pig had studied on the internet and done a ton of research after seeing all the other pigs in the community have their houses blown down by the wolf. 

That would caused the entire home to collapse. 

It was difficult to obtain uranium but luckily for the pig, he was able to find some on Amazon. He also had a ton of experience building homes. The wolf went back to his house and tried to do some research of his own. He had to figure out what could destroy uranium.

The wolf drove to the pigs home and got out of the water truck. He turned the hose and sprayed the home and to his dismay, the house didn't collapse like the internet said it would.  The pig came out of his house and was laughing at the wolf. He explained to him that the house wasn't actually made of depleted uranium. He would never tell the wolf the material of the home because he knew the wolf would go straight to the internet to find out how to ruin his house.
