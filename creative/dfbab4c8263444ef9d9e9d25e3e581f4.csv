Yes, we know we haven't signed the appearance contract. Yes, we know there is an extra fee for out od country work. Yes we received your rider requirements. Human, do you not know who we are? What we can do to you?""
Alien:, ""ight click me., you $(#*^&#*$&."" The commander hung up on Matt Damon's agent (again) and turned to the cursing crew man. ""They won't stop with the scam calls Sir! This one keep saying he was from Microsoft and they had reports we had viruses and...."" 
Commander, ""I don't care how many times a day they call us.
 Don't give in. We'll be out of range eventually."" But he was wrong. Every time they tried to run out of range, a new call would come in. Not just one call either. All communications terminal, lines, means of communication. The scam and spam calls were non-stop. And if there was a break and a real call got through...it was just 10x worse after. 

""How long do you think they can last like this?"" asked the commander. His chief scientist approached to give his report. Sir, it appears their is no life form in the galaxy stronger, more resilient, or more persistent than the 'scam caller'. I recommend we return the Matt Damon specimen immediately.""

The scientist shock his head. ""Better to return him now rather than risk bringing this plague back to the homeworld."" 

The commander eventually agreed and they made the decision to turn back. The scam calls continued, and were a torment, but Matt Damon was quite delightful. The crew grew soft and coddled the earthling. They were all a little sad when they returned him to the planet. ",2397,[],0,2,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,2190
