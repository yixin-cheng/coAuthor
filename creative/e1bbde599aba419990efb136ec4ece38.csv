Those people are now going through a crisis. A life filled with anxiety and panic. There is nothing they can do. They know what is going to happen to end their life and when. That has to be a very scary thing to deal with. It's like having a death sentence on you and not being able to do anything about it. 

The scientists tell the public that the drug had a shelf life they didn't previously know about. It only lasts for 50 years. Their testing wasn't done well enough. The technology just didn't work out the way that they were seeing over their short term research. The scientists were only able to test the drug for a few hours and they believed that it was going to be safe forever.

Those people are now going through a crisis. A life filled with anxiety and panic. There is nothing they can do. They know what is going to happen to end their life and when.

It brings up an interesting debate. Would you rather live a pretty long life but have to suffer a horrific death or just deal with fate? Some people will benefit from fate, some won't. But ultimately it's an interesting concept. Immortality is something that everyone wants. We all want to live forever. The fact that the science isn't ready for that yet shouldn't be surprised. But those people 26 and under fully believed that they would be immortal. After all, that's the entire reason why they were taking the drug.

Those people are now going through a crisis. A life filled with anxiety and panic. There is nothing they can do. They know what is going to happen to end their life and when. That has to be a very scary thing to deal with. It's like having a death sentence on you and not being able to do anything about it.
