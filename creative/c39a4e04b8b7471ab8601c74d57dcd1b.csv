 John was the second generation to start to have noticeable powers. It was almost something that he had taken for granted, as he did not know what it was like before to have none.

This is a story of the end of the world, and the beginning of the next.
 John was the second generation to start to have noticeable powers. It was almost something that he had taken for granted, as he did not know what it was like before to have none. There were now classes in the little school to teach the children how to harness their Mana and use it, in the hopes that one day a generation would be strong enough to take back their home.
John was now in his final year of school, and was one of the stronger students.
 While he was stronger, he was still not considered unusual, as there had been far more impressive people he had learned about in his history class. He didn't know that one day that was about to change and he could hold the key to restoring order on his earth.
He was a tall, well-built young man with short brown hair and a friendly face.
 Nothing that spoke to the powers that were laying in wait inside him. It was during a practice exercise that he began to feel different. The goal was to either provide a shield around yourself, or blast away a fake alien that was in the fight room. A good student could be fairly impressive at one, although no one was really that great. The instructors hoped that with practice though, the children would be powerful enough when they grew up to serve the security force well.

Suddenly it was John's turn. He felt a cold stillness take over his body that he had never felt before. And then suddenly it exploded around him. The fake alien flew back against the wall with such force that it clattered to the ground in pieces. But not only that, there was now a distinctive blue shield around John. He had done both.
The instructors were stunned.
 No one could speak. Finally they told John to release his shield and shower and get ready for his next class. By the time he went home and had dinner for his family, ",2148,[],0,0,5,30,0.3,1,0,0,1706

There were now classes in the little school to teach the children how to harness their Mana and use it, in the hopes that one day a generation would be strong enough to take back their home.
John was now in his final year of school, and was one of the stronger students.
 While he was stronger, he was still not considered unusual, as there had been far more impressive people he had learned about in his history class. He didn't know that one day that was about to change and he could hold the key to restoring order on his earth.

The goal was to either provide a shield around yourself, or blast away a fake alien that was in the fight room. A good student could be fairly impressive at one, although no one was really that great. The instructors hoped that with practice though, the children would be powerful enough when they grew up to serve the security force well.

The fake alien flew back against the wall with such force that it clattered to the ground in pieces. But not only that, there was now a distinctive blue shield around John. He had done both.
The instructors were stunned.
 No one could speak. Finally they told John to release his shield and shower and get ready for his next class. By the time he went home and had dinner for his family, he had forgotten about his display, but the school had no",2205,[],0,0,5,30,0.3,1,0,0,1763

There were now classes in the little school to teach the children how to harness their Mana and use it, in the hopes that one day a generation would be strong enough to take back their home.
John was now in his final year of school, and was one of the stronger students.
 While he was stronger, he was still not considered unusual, as there had been far more impressive people he had learned about in his history class. He didn't know that one day that was about to change and he could hold the key to restoring order on his earth.
He was a tall, well-built young man with short brown hair and a friendly face.
 Nothing that spoke to the powers that were laying in wait inside him. It was during a practice exercise that he began to feel different. The goal was to either provide a shield around yourself, or blast away a fake alien that was in the fight room. A good student could be fairly impressive at one, although no one was really that great. The instructors hoped that with practice though, the children would be powerful enough when they grew up to serve the security force well.

The fake alien flew back against the wall with such force that it clattered to the ground in pieces. But not only that, there was now a distinctive blue shield around John. He had done both.
The instructors were stunned.
 No one could speak. Finally they told John to release his shield and shower and get ready for his next class. By the time he went home and had dinner for his family, he had forgotten about his display, but the school had not. There was a knock at the door and the h",2247,[],0,0,5,30,0.3,1,0,0,1805

John was now in his final year of school, and was one of the stronger students.
 While he was stronger, he was still not considered unusual, as there had been far more impressive people he had learned about in his history class. He didn't know that one day that was about to change and he could hold the key to restoring order on his earth.
He was a tall, well-built young man with short brown hair and a friendly face.
 Nothing that spoke to the powers that were laying in wait inside him. It was during a practice exercise that he began to feel different. The goal was to either provide a shield around yourself, or blast away a fake alien that was in the fight room. A good student could be fairly impressive at one, although no one was really that great. The instructors hoped that with practice though, the children would be powerful enough when they grew up to serve the security force well.

Suddenly it was John's turn. He felt a cold stillness take over his body that he had never felt before. And then suddenly it exploded around him. The fake alien flew back against the wall with such force that it clattered to the ground in pieces. But not only that, there was now a distinctive blue shield around John. He had done both.
The instructors were stunned.
 No one could speak. Finally they told John to release his shield and shower and get ready for his next class. By the time he went home and had dinner for his family, he had forgotten about his display, but the school had not.

There were now classes in the little school to teach the children how to harness their Mana and use it, in the hopes that one day a generation would be strong enough to take back their home.
John was now in his final year of school, and was one of the stronger students.
 While he was stronger, he was still not considered unusual, as there had been far more impressive people he had learned about in his history class. He didn't know that one day that was about to change and he could hold the key to restoring order on his earth.
He was a tall, well-built young man with short brown hair and a friendly face.
 Nothing that spoke to the powers that were laying in wait inside him. It was during a practice exercise that he began to feel different. The goal was to either provide a shield around yourself, or blast away a fake alien that was in the fight room. A good student could be fairly impressive at one, although no one was really that great. The instructors hoped that with practice though, the children would be powerful enough when they grew up to serve the security force well.

Suddenly it was John's turn. He felt a cold stillness take over his body that he had never felt before. And then suddenly it exploded around him. The fake alien flew back against the wall with such force that it clattered to the ground in pieces. But not only that, there was now a distinctive blue shield around John. He had done both.
The instructors were stunned.
 No one could speak. Finally they told John to release his shield and shower and get ready for his next class. By the time he went home and had dinner for his family, he had forgotten about his display, but the school had not. There was a knock at the door and the headmaster and the head of security were ushered into the sitting room. They conferred with John's parents for quite some time.

 John was the second generation to start to have noticeable powers. It was almost something that he had taken for granted, as he did not know what it was like before to have none. There were now classes in the little school to teach the children how to harness their Mana and use it, in the hopes that one day a generation would be strong enough to take back their home.
John was now in his final year of school, and was one of the stronger students.
 While he was stronger, he was still not considered unusual, as there had been far more impressive people he had learned about in his history class. He didn't know that one day that was about to change and he could hold the key to restoring order on his earth.
He was a tall, well-built young man with short brown hair and a friendly face.
 Nothing that spoke to the powers that were laying in wait inside him. It was during a practice exercise that he began to feel different. The goal was to either provide a shield around yourself, or blast away a fake alien that was in the fight room. A good student could be fairly impressive at one, although no one was really that great. The instructors hoped that with practice though, the children would be powerful enough when they grew up to serve the security force well.

Suddenly it was John's turn. He felt a cold stillness take over his body that he had never felt before. And then suddenly it exploded around him. The fake alien flew back against the wall with such force that it clattered to the ground in pieces. But not only that, there was now a distinctive blue shield around John. He had done both.
The instructors were stunned.
 No one could speak. Finally they told John to release his shield and shower and get ready for his next class. By the time he went home and had dinner for his family, he had forgotten about his display, but the school had not.

This is a story of the end of the world, and the beginning of the next.
 John was the second generation to start to have noticeable powers. It was almost something that he had taken for granted, as he did not know what it was like before to have none. There were now classes in the little school to teach the children how to harness their Mana and use it, in the hopes that one day a generation would be strong enough to take back their home.
John was now in his final year of school, and was one of the stronger students.
 While he was stronger, he was still not considered unusual, as there had been far more impressive people he had learned about in his history class. He didn't know that one day that was about to change and he could hold the key to restoring order on his earth.
He was a tall, well-built young man with short brown hair and a friendly face.
 Nothing that spoke to the powers that were laying in wait inside him. It was during a practice exercise that he began to feel different. The goal was to either provide a shield around yourself, or blast away a fake alien that was in the fight room. A good student could be fairly impressive at one, although no one was really that great. The instructors hoped that with practice though, the children would be powerful enough when they grew up to serve the security force well.

Suddenly it was John's turn. He felt a cold stillness take over his body that he had never felt before. And then suddenly it exploded around him. The fake alien flew back against the wall with such force that it clattered to the ground in pieces. But not only that, there was now a distinctive blue shield around John. He had done both.
The instructors were stunned.
 No one could speak. Finally they told John to release his shield and shower and get ready for his next class. By the time he went home and had dinner for his family, he had forgotten about his display, but the school had not. There was a knock at the door and the headmaster and the head of security were ushered into the sitting room. They conferred with John's parents for quite some time.

He was a tall, well-built young man with short brown hair and a friendly face.

The instructors were stunned.

 John was the second generation to start to have noticeable powers. It was almost something that he had taken for granted, as he did not know what it was like before to have none.

This is a story of the end of the world, and the beginning of the next.
 John was the second generation to start to have noticeable powers. It was almost something that he had taken for granted, as he did not know what it was like before to have none. There were now classes in the little school to teach the children how to harness their Mana and use it, in the hopes that one day a generation would be strong enough to take back their home.
John was now in his final year of school, and was one of the stronger students.
 While he was stronger, he was still not considered unusual, as there had been far more impressive people he had learned about in his history class. He didn't know that one day that was about to change and he could hold the key to restoring order on his earth.
He was a tall, well-built young man with short brown hair and a friendly face.
 Nothing that spoke to the powers that were laying in wait inside him. It was during a practice exercise that he began to feel different. The goal was to either provide a shield around yourself, or blast away a fake alien that was in the fight room. A good student could be fairly impressive at one, although no one was really that great. The instructors hoped that with practice though, the children would be powerful enough when they grew up to serve the security force well.

Suddenly it was John's turn. He felt a cold stillness take over his body that he had never felt before. And then suddenly it exploded around him. The fake alien flew back against the wall with such force that it clattered to the ground in pieces. But not only that, there was now a distinctive blue shield around John. He had done both.
The instructors were stunned.
 No one could speak. Finally they told John to release his shield and shower and get ready for his next class. By the time he went home and had dinner for his family, he had forgotten about his display, but the school had not. There was a knock at the door and the headmaster and the head of security were ushered into the sitting room. They conferred with John's parents for quite some time.

There were now classes in the little school to teach the children how to harness their Mana and use it, in the hopes that one day a generation would be strong enough to take back their home.
John was now in his final year of school, and was one of the stronger students.
 While he was stronger, he was still not considered unusual, as there had been far more impressive people he had learned about in his history class. He didn't know that one day that was about to change and he could hold the key to restoring order on his earth.
He was a tall, well-built young man with short brown hair and a friendly face.
 Nothing that spoke to the powers that were laying in wait inside him. It was during a practice exercise that he began to feel different. The goal was to either provide a shield around yourself, or blast away a fake alien that was in the fight room. A good student could be fairly impressive at one, although no one was really that great. The instructors hoped that with practice though, the children would be powerful enough when they grew up to serve the security force well.

Suddenly it was John's turn. He felt a cold stillness take over his body that he had never felt before. And then suddenly it exploded around him. The fake alien flew back against the wall with such force that it clattered to the ground in pieces. But not only that, there was now a distinctive blue shield around John. He had done both.
The instructors were stunned.
 No one could speak. Finally they told John to release his shield and shower and get ready for his next class. By the time he went home and had dinner for his family, he had forgotten about his display, but the school had not. There was a knock at the door and the headmaster and the head of security were ushered into the sitting room. They conferred with John's parents for quite some time.
""John, we have some good news for you,"" his father said.

 John was the second generation to start to have noticeable powers. It was almost something that he had taken for granted, as he did not know what it was like before to have none. There were now classes in the little school to teach the children how to harness their Mana and use it, in the hopes that one day a generation would be strong enough to take back their home.
John was now in his final year of school, and was one of the stronger students.
 While he was stronger, he was still not considered unusual, as there had been far more impressive people he had learned about in his history class. He didn't know that one day that was about to change and he could hold the key to restoring order on his earth.

The goal was to either provide a shield around yourself, or blast away a fake alien that was in the fight room. A good student could be fairly impressive at one, although no one was really that great. The instructors hoped that with practice though, the children would be powerful enough when they grew up to serve the security force well.

The fake alien flew back against the wall with such force that it clattered to the ground in pieces. But not only that, there was now a distinctive blue shield around John. He had done both.
The instructors were stunned.
 No one could speak. Finally they told John to release his shield and shower and get ready for his next class.

The goal was to either provide a shield around yourself, or blast away a fake alien that was in the fight room.

The instructors were stunned.

John was now in his final year of school, and was one of the stronger students.
 While he was stronger, he was still not considered unusual, as there had been far more impressive people he had learned about in his history class. He didn't know that one day that was about to change and he could hold the key to restoring order on his earth.

 Nothing that spoke to the powers that were laying in wait inside him. It was during a practice exercise that he began to feel different. The goal was to either provide a shield around yourself, or blast away a fake alien that was in the fight room. A good student could be fairly impressive at one, although no one was really that great. The instructors hoped that with practice though, the children would be powerful enough when they grew up to serve the security force well.

The fake alien flew back against the wall with such force that it clattered to the ground in pieces. But not only that, there was now a distinctive blue shield around John. He had done both.
The instructors were stunned.
 No one could speak. Finally they told John to release his shield and shower and get ready for his next class. By the time he went home and had dinner for his family, he had forgotten about his display, but the school had not. There was a knock at the door and the headmaster and the head of security were ushered into the sitting room. They conferred with John's parents for quite some time.

 John was the second generation to start to have noticeable powers. It was almost something that he had taken for granted, as he did not know what it was like before to have none. There were now classes in the little school to teach the children how to harness their Mana and use it, in the hopes that one day a generation would be strong enough to take back their home.
John was now in his final year of school, and was one of the stronger students.
 While he was stronger, he was still not considered unusual, as there had been far more impressive people he had learned about in his history class. He didn't know that one day that was about to change and he could hold the key to restoring order on his earth.
He was a tall, well-built young man with short brown hair and a friendly face.
 Nothing that spoke to the powers that were laying in wait inside him. It was during a practice exercise that he began to feel different. The goal was to either provide a shield around yourself, or blast away a fake alien that was in the fight room. A good student could be fairly impressive at one, although no one was really that great. The instructors hoped that with practice though, the children would be powerful enough when they grew up to serve the security force well.

Suddenly it was John's turn. He felt a cold stillness take over his body that he had never felt before. And then suddenly it exploded around him. The fake alien flew back against the wall with such force that it clattered to the ground in pieces. But not only that, there was now a distinctive blue shield around John. He had done both.
The instructors were stunned.
 No one could speak. Finally they told John to release his shield and shower and get ready for his next class. By the time he went home and had dinner for his family, he had forgotten about his display, but the school had not. There was a knock at the door and the headmaster and the head of security were ushered into the sitting room. They conferred with John's parents for quite some time.

 "" You are going to be given an opportunity that most can only dream of.""

This is a story of the end of the world, and the beginning of the next.
 John was the second generation to start to have noticeable powers. It was almost something that he had taken for granted, as he did not know what it was like before to have none. There were now classes in the little school to teach the children how to harness their Mana and use it, in the hopes that one day a generation would be strong enough to take back their home.
John was now in his final year of school, and was one of the stronger students.
 While he was stronger, he was still not considered unusual, as there had been far more impressive people he had learned about in his history class. He didn't know that one day that was about to change and he could hold the key to restoring order on his earth.
He was a tall, well-built young man with short brown hair and a friendly face.
 Nothing that spoke to the powers that were laying in wait inside him. It was during a practice exercise that he began to feel different. The goal was to either provide a shield around yourself, or blast away a fake alien that was in the fight room. A good student could be fairly impressive at one, although no one was really that great. The instructors hoped that with practice though, the children would be powerful enough when they grew up to serve the security force well.

Suddenly it was John's turn. He felt a cold stillness take over his body that he had never felt before. And then suddenly it exploded around him. The fake alien flew back against the wall with such force that it clattered to the ground in pieces. But not only that, there was now a distinctive blue shield around John. He had done both.
The instructors were stunned.
 No one could speak. Finally they told John to release his shield and shower and get ready for his next class. By the time he went home and had dinner for his family, he had forgotten about his display, but the school had not. There was a knock at the door and the headmaster and the head of security were ushered into the sitting room. They conferred with John's parents for quite some time.
""John, we have some good news for you,"" his father said.
 "" You are going to be given an opportunity that most can only dream of."" 
""You are going to the capital"" There were tears in his father's eyes but pride in his voice. And John knew that while it was called an opportunity, he was not being given a choice.
