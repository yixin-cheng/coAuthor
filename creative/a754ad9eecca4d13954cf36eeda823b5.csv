 Unfortunately, the shape-shifter already has another scheme cooked up to date her again as a different guy. He is determined to get it right this time.

It is a sad story about a woman who just can't seem to find love. She has been dating guy after guy but it never seems to work out. Something does seem oddly familiar about the dates she has been going on though. She is unaware that she is actually dating the same guy over and over. It is almost as if the guys are the same in a way. She has been dating a shapeshifter who is trying to get it right this time. However, she does not know this until one fateful night she catches him in the act. She goes into the bathroom and sees him shape-shifting from the guy she has been dating to someone who looks totally different. She is shocked and runs out of the bathroom. She has no idea what to do with the news so she just runs away from his apartment. he goes home and tries to forget about the whole thing.
 Unfortunately, the shape-shifter already has another scheme cooked up to date her again as a different guy. He is determined to get it right this time. He wants to learn from his failures and not accept that he truly is not the one for her. He is determined to win her over and make her his. After about 2 additional years of this dating back and forth she finally decides to stop dating altogether. She decides to just be single and not date anyone. This is devastating to the shape-shifter and he has no idea what to do. He decides to go to her house and talk to her about it. He explains this is all because he loves her so much. He wants to be with her and he is willing to do anything to make it happen. She explains he is not the one for her and he never will be. He is not the one for her because she is in love with someone else. 

The story ends with the man committing suicide since he does not want to be with anyone else and feels hopeless. The woman goes on to make a big family with the man and lives well even after all of the trauma she experienced. It was a sad story of basically a stalker that was more persistent than most who had mental health issues. The story was very sad and the ending was not what I expected. It made me pretty sad overall and I wanted to cry.",2330,[],0,0,5,30,0.3,1,0,0,1635

She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time.

It is a sad story about a woman who just can't seem to find love. She has been dating guy after guy but it never seems to work out. Something does seem oddly familiar about the dates she has been going on though. She is unaware that she is actually dating the same guy over and over. It is almost as if the guys are the same in a way. She has been dating a shapeshifter who is trying to get it right this time. However, she does not know this until one fateful night she catches him in the act. She goes into the bathroom and sees him shape-shifting from the guy she has been dating to someone who looks totally different. She is shocked and runs out of the bathroom. She has no idea what to do with the news so she just runs away from his apartment. he goes home and tries to forget about the whole thing.
 Unfortunately, the shape-shifter already has another scheme cooked up to date her again as a different guy. He is determined to get it right this time. He wants to learn from his failures and not accept that he truly is not the one for her. He is determined to win her over and make her his. After about 2 additional years of this dating back and forth she finally decides to stop dating altogether. She decides to just be single and not date anyone. This is devastating to the shape-shifter and he has no idea what to do. He decides to go to her house and talk to her about it. He explains this is all because he loves her so much. He wants to be with her and he is willing to do anything to make it happen. She explains he is not the one for her and he never will be. He is not the one for her because she is in love with someone else.
