One day, she receives an email from someone new. Since she has a lot of time on her hands, she decides to meet him for coffee. The last guy stopped answering her calls, and she was hopeful. 
When she arrives to the coffee shop, her date already has a cup in front of him.
 She walks over to the table. 
""This is for you."" he says, pointing at the cup.
  ""What about you?"" she asks. ""Don't you want a drink too?"" 
""Oh, I don't need one."" he replies.
 ""I just had one last week."" ""That's odd,"" she thought. She tried to think of something to say.

""Wait.
 You should know the real reason I called you here,"" he said. ""I wanted to see if you'd let me have one more shot with you."" 

She was confused. ""But we only just met. What do you mean, one more shot?"" 
He sat back down.
 ""It's me""  

She looked at him once more and shook her head. ""You have me mistaken for someone else,"" she said. ""I don't even know who you are."" 

Just then, in the blink of an eye, he transformed. She was so shocked, she couldn't move. Sitting in front of her was the last guy she dated. The one that stopped calling her back.

She looked at him once more and shook her head. ""You have me mistaken for someone else,"" she said. ""I don't even know who you are."" 

Just then, in the blink of an eye, he transformed. She was so shocked, she couldn't move. Sitting in front of her was the last guy she dated. The one that stopped calling her back.

  ""What about you?"" she asks. ""Don't you want a drink too?"" 
""Oh, I don't need one."" he replies.
 ""I just had one last week."" ""That's odd,"" she thought. She tried to think of something to say. 
""Oh, so do you come here often?"" she asks.
 
""I come here every week."" he replies.
 She was confused. 

""I thought you said you just had a drink here last week."" she says. She was wondering if she should leave. 
""I did."" he says.
 At this point, it didn't matter. She was ready to go. 
""Well, I gotta run.
