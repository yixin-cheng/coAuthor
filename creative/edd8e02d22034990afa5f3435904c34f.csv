But with over 7 billion of us on the planet now, Mana has spread far too thinly to have any effect. When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.
The world is now a place where the very air is alive with Mana, and the ability to wield it is the only thing that can save
 humans from the evil race that has colonized and ruined the planet.
This is a story of a boy who lost everything, but gained the power to change everything.
 His name is Martin Onondaga. He was born just two years after the invasion, and educated in a secret school in Wisconsin's Manitowoc County.
He is the first of a new generation of humans to wield the power of Mana.
 Using the power, he released every person held captive anywhere in the world. These became his servants. Wielding of the great power of Mana, they were able to overcome their captors and set up bases in every corner of the globe.
Now, the world is divided into thwo parts the Onondaga, tand the alien lands called Shinto
 The Onondaga are the humans who wield Mana, and the Shinto are the aliens who do not.

Martin took up residence in the former Wisconsin jail cell of Steven Avery, a wrongly convicted man who has vowed to leaded Martin's army as it grows and wields Mana. Steven knows that justice requires that evil be smashed, and on his orders several hydrogen bombs explode over the Wisconsin Lakes early on a chilly morning in November.

The world is now a place where the very air is alive with Mana, and the ability to wield it is the only thing that can save
 humans from the evil race that has colonized and ruined the planet.
This is a story of a boy who lost everything, but gained the power to change everything.
 His name is Martin Onondaga. He was born just two years after the invasion, and educated in a secret school in Wisconsin's Manitowoc County.
He is the first of a new generation of humans to wield the power of Mana.
 Using the power, he released every person held captive anywhere in the world. These became his servants. Wielding of the great power of Mana, they were able to overcome their captors and set up bases in every corner of the globe.
Now, the world is divided into thwo parts the Onondaga, tand the alien lands called Shinto
 The Onondaga are the humans who wield Mana, and the Shinto are the aliens who do not.

Martin took up residence in the former Wisconsin jail cell of Steven Avery, a wrongly convicted man who has vowed to leaded Martin's army as it grows and wields Mana. Steven knows that justice requires that evil be smashed, and on his orders several hydrogen bombs explode over the Wisconsin Lakes early on a chilly morning in November.

This is a story of a boy who lost everything, but gained the power to change everything.
 His name is Martin Onondaga. He was born just two years after the invasion, and educated in a secret school in Wisconsin's Manitowoc County.
He is the first of a new generation of humans to wield the power of Mana.
 Using the power, he released every person held captive anywhere in the world. These became his servants. Wielding of the great power of Mana, they were able to overcome their captors and set up bases in every corner of the globe.
Now, the world is divided into thwo parts the Onondaga, tand the alien lands called Shinto
 The Onondaga are the humans who wield Mana, and the Shinto are the aliens who do not.
