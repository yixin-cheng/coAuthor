The bee thought for a moment. ""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but I cannot do that.

""Yes you can, and you will!"" 

""No, Your Majesty, I cannot. I have only one stinger, which I just used on the man in the red hat.""

""I'm afraid that's impossible. I cannot grow another stinger.""

""Then find more bees! Lots more! An army of bees!""

""Certainly, Your Majesty. And which man would that be?"" said the bee.

""No, Your Majesty, I cannot. I have only one stinger, which I just used on the man in the red hat.""

""I'm afraid that's impossible. I cannot grow another stinger.""

""Then find more bees! Lots more! An army of bees!""

""As you wish, Your Majesty.""
 And with that, the bee flew off. The queen sat and thought for a moment. ""I could get used to this,"" she said. ""What else shall the bee do for me today?"" 
The bee returned, and said ""Your Majesty, I have done as you commanded, and stung the man with the red hat.
 ""Very well then,"" said the queen. ""Now, go and sting every other man in the kingdom."" 

""Every man, your majesty?"" 
""Every man, bee.""


The bee thought for a moment. ""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but I cannot do that.

""Yes you can, and you will!"" 

""No, Your Majesty, I cannot. I have only one stinger, which I just used on the man in the red hat."" 
""Then go and get another stinger!""""

""I'm afraid that's impossible. I cannot grow another stinger.""

""Then find more bees! Lots more! An army of bees!"" 

""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but there are no more bees."" 
""What do you mean, no more bees?"" Where are they?"" 

""They're all dead, Your Majesty. I was the lone surviving bee in the kingdom. At your service."" 
""Then go and sting yourself!""


""I'm afraid that's impossible, Your majesty. I cannot sting myself. I have no stinger left.""

The queen was mad. She was furious. What good was being queen if she could not get what she desired? She was about to give the bee a piece of her mind, when she noticed that the bee was gone. She looked down and saw a note scribbled on a piece of paper. ""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but I cannot help you. With no stinger and no friends, I wish to spend my last days flying free."" 
The queen was moved by the bee's words.

""That one over there, the one with the red hat."" And when you're through with him, sting every other man.""

You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" You look down, and see a tiny bee, dressed in a tiny suit and hat. ""Who are you?"" says the queen. ""I am your loyal servant, your majesty. Anything you wish is my command."" ""Then go and sting that man who has been bothering me.""

""Certainly, Your Majesty. And which man would that be?"" said the bee. 
""That one over there, the one with the red hat."" And when you're through with him, sting every other man."" 
""As you wish, Your Majesty.""
 And with that, the bee flew off. The queen sat and thought for a moment. ""I could get used to this,"" she said. ""What else shall the bee do for me today?"" 
The bee returned, and said ""Your Majesty, I have done as you commanded, and stung the man with the red hat.
 ""Very well then,"" said the queen. ""Now, go and sting every other man in the kingdom."" 

""Every man, your majesty?"" 
""Every man, bee.""


The bee thought for a moment. ""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but I cannot do that.

""Yes you can, and you will!"" 

""No, Your Majesty, I cannot. I have only one stinger, which I just used on the man in the red hat."" 
""Then go and get another stinger!""""

""I'm afraid that's impossible. I cannot grow another stinger.""

""Then find more bees! Lots more! An army of bees!"" 

""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but there are no more bees."" 
""What do you mean, no more bees?"" Where are they?"" 

""They're all dead, Your Majesty. I was the lone surviving bee in the kingdom. At your service."" 
""Then go and sting yourself!""


""I'm afraid that's impossible, Your majesty. I cannot sting myself. I have no stinger left."" 
""Then go and find me a man with a stinger!""

The queen was mad. She was furious. What good was being queen if she could not get what she desired? She was about to give the bee a piece of her mind, when she noticed that the bee was gone. She looked down and saw a note scribbled on a piece of paper. ""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but I cannot help you. With no stinger and no friends, I wish to spend my last days flying free.""
