He's trying to figure out the most efficient way to ransom him, but needs a better understanding of human culture.
 He's sent his drones out to learn about human culture by looking at what they watch on TV. After reviewing the information retrieved by the drones, the alien decides he wants a Ferrari sports car to take back to space with him. He thinks that maybe the humans will give him this car in exchange for returning Matt Damon to them.  So, he calls the FBI and says, ""I have your movie star Matt Damon. I will return him in exchange for one Ferrari."" 
The FBI doesn't respond to the alien's request directly, but instead they contact a Ferrari dealer aeo see if they would help.
