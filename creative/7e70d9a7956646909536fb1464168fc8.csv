Soeurette is a bit of a ditz, and a bit of a flirt.
 And moreover, she is a bit of a gold digger, and a bit of a social climber, and a bit of a snob. She is not the nicest person in the world, and she is not the brightest bulb in the chandelier. So when Matt first introduced himself to her in college, she was immediately hooked, because Matt was a basketball player on the varsity team and Soeurette knew that Matt was an econ major, which meant that he would be rich someday. After all, she expected that he would go on to work at a prestigious bank in New York City, and this would mean that she would be able to live in a penthouse apartment, and drive a Mercedes-Benz, and wear designer clothes, and go on expensive vacations to St. Tropez. So, Soeurette was immediately attracted to Matt, and she fell head over heels in love with him. But Soeurette ends up breaking off the relationship because Matt was cheating on her at the time. A year later, Matt reenters her life and Soeurette is too dumb to realize that it's him, and she falls for him all over again. Matt again wrongs Soeurette by getting another woman pregnant, and Soeurette breaks up with him again. She cries, and she's sad, and she's heartbroken, and she's devastated, and she's angry, and she's hurt, and she's confused. So when Matt comes back into her life again without her realizing his identity, she is relieved to find that she is capable of finding love again. It's too bad though because Matt is still seeing other women on the side, and this time he's seeing Soeurette's younger sister, Virginia.  When Soeurette finds this out she again throws Matt out.

Soeurette is a bit of a ditz, and a bit of a flirt.
 And moreover, she is a bit of a gold digger, and a bit of a social climber, and a bit of a snob. She is not the nicest person in the world, and she is not the brightest bulb in the chandelier.

Matt again wrongs Soeurette by getting another woman pregnant, and Soeurette breaks up with him again.

Matt again wrongs Soeurette by getting another woman pregnant, and Soeurette breaks up with him again.

It's too bad though because Matt is still seeing other women on the side, and this time he's seeing Soeurette's younger sister, Virginia.  When Soeurette finds this out she again throws Matt out. But Matt quickly finds his way back to her and tells her he's committed for life. Soeurette believes him again and for whatever reason, this time Matt actually does hold true to his word.

A year later, Matt reenters her life and Soeurette is too dumb to realize that it's him, and she falls for him all over again. Matt again wrongs Soeurette by getting another woman pregnant, and Soeurette breaks up with him again. She cries, and she's sad, and she's heartbroken, and she's devastated, and she's angry, and she's hurt, and she's confused.
