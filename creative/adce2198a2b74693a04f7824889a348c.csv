Reincarnation overall is a very conceptual idea that has roots in ancient culture. I believe this movie would be a great way to get people thinking about the idea of reincarnation.

Most ancient cultures had at least some beliefs that a person would come back after death. This movie would be a great way to show how the idea of reincarnation has impacted the culture in general. In a way, it would help people wrap their heads around the concept and possibly learn how it has been viewed throughout history. I think that this movie would be very popular and would be an interesting concept to watch.

This would allow the viewer to become more invested in the man and develop an interest in what he did so wrong that caused a reincarnation event.

In closing I do believe this is a fascinating idea for a movie and actually has some roots in our history overall.
