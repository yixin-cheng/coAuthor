A powerful politician named Chiang Kai-Shek is determined to take over the United States.
 The plan was for the other countries around the world to cut off ties from the USA and band forces together in order to take them over.  hen the idea was first conceived, it was believed that it would take a long time to do so.
 However, when the isolation proposition was proposed, it granted the perfect opportunity for the tides to shift. Specifically, China, North and South Korea,  and Japan all had plans to band together with whomever would join in order to take over the USA. Little did they know that although the USA had gone into isolation, they had an idea that something fishy was going on. Along with Ally's Russia, Canada, and Africa, will the USA be able to defind itself and the other nations from being taken over by Chiang Kai-Shek? The war is a relatively short one as the countries had been preparing for this moment for over fifty years. This was the most lethal war in history as Chiang Kai-Shek immediately started dropping bombs on the USA and its ally countries. If not for russia, China would have been able to do much more damage than it had previously done. Russia stormed their country and prevented the attacks long enough for the USA to fight back and send troops into the country. The USA, Canada, Russia, and Africa fought back with all they force they could come up with, and knocked off Chiang Kai-Shek once and for all. The war showed that you can not really ever truly trust other nations, and it increased the use of espionage greatly. This ev marked an important point in history.
