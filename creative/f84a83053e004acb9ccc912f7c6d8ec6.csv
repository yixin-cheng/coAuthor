But with over 7 billion of us on the planet now, Mana has spread far too thinly to have any effect. When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. That old power is the Mana Tree, a living record of all the magic ever performed. For centuries it slumbered, withered, seemingly dead. But now , with Mana returning to the world, it has begun to bloom once more.  As it grows, its power begins to return to the world, along with the knowledge of how to use that power. 
ASeizingfupon the desperate hope the tree brings, two actions hoorm both dedicated to studying The Mana Tree and harnessing its power.
  The first, the Keepers of The Mana Tree, seek to preserve and grow the tree. The second, the Harvesters, seek to cut into the tree, releasing the Mana that it holds in the hope that it will restore humanity to its former magical state.  he fate of the world rests in the hands of those who would harvest it... and the hands of those who would protect it.


Meanwhile, the Mana Tree is changing the world.   The power of Mana is slowly spreading, aided by the growth of the tree, awakening magic in those with a strong affinity for it. As this occurs, some humans gain the magic that they need to fight against the aliens.  nfortunately, this new magical power is unstable., and though it wins some victories against the conquerors of Earth, it also deserts its users, or even kills them. For now, it's not enough to turn the tide of battle. 

Meanwhile, the Havesters are continuing to cut pieces from the tree, despite warnings from The Keepers. Those who anoint themselves with the sap gleaned from the cuttings, and wield the cut wood, gain incredible power, enough to occasionally defeat the invaders. But this is only temporary, and slows the long term spread of mana. Despite this, the Havesters continue to cut, believing that the survival of humanity requires that they do so. They overwhelm the opposition of The Keepers, and are able to gain enough temporary power to drive the invaders away.

So, the battle is won, but the war is lost. The cutting has been too much for the tree to survive, and with its death, the mana that, unknown to all, keeps the Earth alive, dies with it. The Harvesters are left with their power to rule over a dying and soon-to-be-lifeless world.",2382,[],0,1,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,1662
