 The alien is about the size of a human infant, with four fingers. Its head has a large, single eye in the center, and two small ears on either side. It has no nose or mouth.
The aliens move by teleporting.  Any place they have been, or any place they will go in the future, they can teleport to.

But what they don't know, is that Ben Affleck is rallying the humans. Matt Damon has survived both the alien abduction, and being teleported through the ship. He has found a way to communicate with Ben Affleck, and they have hatched a plan to save Matt Damon.
Ben Affleck is an expert at teleporting.
 He has studied the alien teleportation, and knows all its secrets. He knows how to get into the alien ship, and he also has a plan for saving Matt Damon. He gathers a small army to help him execute his plan. 

The army attacks the alien ship, disrupting its siphoning process, forcing it to shield itself. When the aliens shield themselves, Ben Affleck uses a special little device that blocks the alien's teleportation. He then teleports into the alien ship, and frees Matt Damon.

 The alien is about the size of a human infant, with four fingers. Its head has a large, single eye in the center, and two small ears on either side. It has no nose or mouth.
The aliens move by teleporting.  Any place they have been, or any place they will go in the future, they can teleport to.

But what they don't know, is that Ben Affleck is rallying the humans. Matt Damon has survived both the alien abduction, and being teleported through the ship. He has found a way to communicate with Ben Affleck, and they have hatched a plan to save Matt Damon.
Ben Affleck is an expert at teleporting.
 He has studied the alien teleportation, and knows all its secrets. He knows how to get into the alien ship, and he also has a plan for saving Matt Damon. He gathers a small army to help him execute his plan. 

The army attacks the alien ship, disrupting its siphoning process, forcing it to shield itself. When the aliens shield themselves, Ben Affleck uses a special little device that blocks the alien's teleportation. He then teleports into the alien ship, and frees Matt Damon. The humans win the battle, and Matt Damon is safely returned to Earth.  ",1704,[],0,2,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,686
