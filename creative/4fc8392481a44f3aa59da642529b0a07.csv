His body today is of a guy named James, who is a senior and a football player. James is a popular person in school, and his personality is confident enough to ask Brie out on a date. 

""Are you free this weekend?"" Asked James to Brie.

""I am free this weekend."" Said Brie. ""Are you asking me out, James, also known as Mr. Popular?""

""Yes, I am."" Says James. ""I'm asking you out on a date.""

The weekend came and Brie and James went to the movies. They seem to have hit it off and they both enjoyed the movie. Right before they were about to go their separate ways, James said, ""My time with you is running out, Brie.""

""Running out how?"" asked Brie,  who got confused. ""What are you talking about?""

""I'm not going to be the same guy you know after this."" said James. ""Can I kiss you?""

Brie nodded and James leaned in for a kiss. The next morning, James had no recollection of what happened and Brie was still confused. She got heartbroken, but so was the shapeshifter.
