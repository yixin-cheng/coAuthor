At first, people accepted the rankings at face value, but then murmurs of dissent arose. Whose rankings were these, anyway? And how did the judges possibly know who was the best at being a father?

Then, the letters started to arrive. ""Want to improve your ranking?"" screamed the headline. ""Now you can, by taking our intensive  course. ""
The letters were sent by a company called ""Our Father, Inc.""
 Their main product was a one-day seminar that would help you become the best possible father. They had a track record of getting fathers' rankings way up. One St. Louis man, the letter claimed, went from just over 145 million up to number 634 after taking the course.
The letter claimed that the course would teach you everything you needed to know about being a better father.
 But it was a ""secret"" course. People who took it were sworn to secrecy.  And the course was not cheap: almost $40,000 and no retakes. The letter came with a form to sign up for the course.
The response to this letter was enormous., until one day a story broke on Buzzfeed. Buzzfeed had obtained a copy of the ""Our Father, Inc."" course and did some digging. The same people who offered the course had another business,

It turns out that ""Our Father, Inc."" is also a company that makes mugs. And they make mugs that change depending on your ranking. Within days, the course business dried right up. The company's website was unavailable for a time. And the coffee mugs that were being sold are marked down to under $10.
But the imemfry o these magic mugs still lingers.
