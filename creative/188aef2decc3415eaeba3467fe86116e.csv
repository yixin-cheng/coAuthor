He is brought to an alien planet. There, they put him in a large room with a TV monitor. The monitor itself is the size of a movie theater screen.

There is one entire church gathered together even in his honor. 

He then looks around and sees other aliens watching as well in other parts of the room. He begins to think that he was taken just so they could watch what we do, almost like earth is one big reality show. 

He then sees a screen of his wife and children. That brings tears to his eyes. He knows he has to get out of here, but he knows earth will rescue him. He just has to be patient.

Over time he goes from watching the monitors to then watching the aliens more. He is fascinated by how obsessed they are with the earth reality program. He sees them watching it all the time, even when they are eating. It occurs to him that they are more advanced than us but when it comes down to it, they love binge watching tv just like us. 

Eventually a crew from earth shows up to rescue him. It's fascinating as the aliens are so busy watching the tv that they don't even seem to care that they are being killed by the soldiers. Once a path is cleared, they free Matt Damon. On the way out he runs into one of the leaders who looks sad that their new favorite tv show is now over.

Matt Damon knows he will be saved but is terrified because he is now aboard a space ship. He is in a cage as he watches these slimy aliens control this futuristic ship. They do not even need to use controls. They just use their minds and it effortlessly goes off into space.

He is brought to an alien planet. There, they put him in a large room with a TV monitor. The monitor itself is the size of a movie theater screen. They turn it on and he sees countless mini screens, each showing earth's reaction to him being taken. He sees people crying and angry. He sees people praying for his safe return. There is one entire church gathered together even in his honor. 

He then looks around and sees other aliens watching as well in other parts of the room. He begins to think that he was taken just so they could watch what we do, almost like earth is one big reality show. 

He then sees a screen of his wife and children. That brings tears to his eyes. He knows he has to get out of here, but he knows earth will rescue him. He just has to be patient.

Over time he goes from watching the monitors to then watching the aliens more. He is fascinated by how obsessed they are with the earth reality program. He sees them watching it all the time, even when they are eating. It occurs to him that they are more advanced than us but when it comes down to it, they love binge watching tv just like us. 

Eventually a crew from earth shows up to rescue him. It's fascinating as the aliens are so busy watching the tv that they don't even seem to care that they are being killed by the soldiers. Once a path is cleared, they free Matt Damon. On the way out he runs into one of the leaders who looks sad that their new favorite tv show is now over.

Matt Damon knows he will be saved but is terrified because he is now aboard a space ship. He is in a cage as he watches these slimy aliens control this futuristic ship. They do not even need to use controls. They just use their minds and it effortlessly goes off into space.

He is brought to an alien planet. There, they put him in a large room with a TV monitor. The monitor itself is the size of a movie theater screen. They turn it on and he sees countless mini screens, each showing earth's reaction to him being taken. He sees people crying and angry. He sees people praying for his safe return. There is one entire church gathered together even in his honor. 

He then looks around and sees other aliens watching as well in other parts of the room. He begins to think that he was taken just so they could watch what we do, almost like earth is one big reality show. 

He then sees a screen of his wife and children. That brings tears to his eyes. He knows he has to get out of here, but he knows earth will rescue him. He just has to be patient.

Over time he goes from watching the monitors to then watching the aliens more. He is fascinated by how obsessed they are with the earth reality program. He sees them watching it all the time, even when they are eating. It occurs to him that they are more advanced than us but when it comes down to it, they love binge watching tv just like us. 

Eventually a crew from earth shows up to rescue him. It's fascinating as the aliens are so busy watching the tv that they don't even seem to care that they are being killed by the soldiers. Once a path is cleared, they free Matt Damon. On the way out he runs into one of the leaders who looks sad that their new favorite tv show is now over. Matt Damon then realizes that these aliens are not so different from us. He writes down his Netflix username and password for him and then leaves.

Matt Damon knows he will be saved but is terrified because he is now aboard a space ship. He is in a cage as he watches these slimy aliens control this futuristic ship. They do not even need to use controls. They just use their minds and it effortlessly goes off into space.

He is brought to an alien planet. There, they put him in a large room with a TV monitor. The monitor itself is the size of a movie theater screen. They turn it on and he sees countless mini screens, each showing earth's reaction to him being taken. He sees people crying and angry. He sees people praying for his safe return. There is one entire church gathered together even in his honor. 

He then looks around and sees other aliens watching as well in other parts of the room. He begins to think that he was taken just so they could watch what we do, almost like earth is one big reality show. 

He then sees a screen of his wife and children. That brings tears to his eyes. He knows he has to get out of here, but he knows earth will rescue him. He just has to be patient.

Over time he goes from watching the monitors to then watching the aliens more. He is fascinated by how obsessed they are with the earth reality program. He sees them watching it all the time, even when they are eating. It occurs to him that they are more advanced than us but when it comes down to it, they love binge watching tv just like us. 

Eventually a crew from earth shows up to rescue him. It's fascinating as the aliens are so busy watching the tv that they don't even seem to care that they are being killed by the soldiers. Once a path is cleared, they free Matt Damon. On the way out he runs into one of the leaders who looks sad that their new favorite tv show is now over. Matt Damon then realizes that these aliens are not so different from us. He writes down his Netflix username and password for him and then leaves.

Matt Damon knows he will be saved but is terrified because he is now aboard a space ship. He is in a cage as he watches these slimy aliens control this futuristic ship. They do not even need to use controls. They just use their minds and it effortlessly goes off into space.

He is brought to an alien planet. There, they put him in a large room with a TV monitor. The monitor itself is the size of a movie theater screen. They turn it on and he sees countless mini screens, each showing earth's reaction to him being taken. He sees people crying and angry. He sees people praying for his safe return. There is one entire church gathered together even in his honor. 

He then looks around and sees other aliens watching as well in other parts of the room. He begins to think that he was taken just so they could watch what we do, almost like earth is one big reality show. 

He then sees a screen of his wife and children. That brings tears to his eyes. He knows he has to get out of here, but he knows earth will rescue him. He just has to be patient.

Over time he goes from watching the monitors to then watching the aliens more. He is fascinated by how obsessed they are with the earth reality program. He sees them watching it all the time, even when they are eating. It occurs to him that they are more advanced than us but when it comes down to it, they love binge watching tv just like us. 

Eventually a crew from earth shows up to rescue him. It's fascinating as the aliens are so busy watching the tv that they don't even seem to care that they are being killed by the soldiers. Once a path is cleared, they free Matt Damon. On the way out he runs into one of the leaders who looks sad that their new favorite tv show is now over.
