He was quiet, thinking about his last day on earth. ""Listen honey, there's something I want to confess."" he said. ""I've been cheating on you."" She was shocked. ""With who?"" she asked. ""With my secretary."" he said. She was furious. She felt so betrayed. ""You lied to me."" she said.

""I'm sorry. The guilt was eating away at me. I figured let me just leave you here on earth so you can go on and be happy now."" he said. She was speechless. She thought about it for a moment. She then said, ""I forgive you."" 

""You do?"" he asked. ""Yes. I forgive you."" she said. ""Now, I have something to confess to you too. Wait here, and I'll be right back.""

She begged him to take the drug. He refused. She was devastated. She had already taken her dose, and was going to live on now without him. She decided to take matters into her own hands. One morning, she was making breakfast. He thought it was going to be his last breakfast. He was sitting at the table, and she was cooking. When he wasn't looking, the woman poured the drug into his tea. She then brought his cup to him where he was seated. He took a sip of his tea, and then another. He was quiet, thinking about his last day on earth. ""Listen honey, there's something I want to confess."" he said. ""I've been cheating on you."" She was shocked. ""With who?"" she asked. ""With my secretary."" he said. She was furious. She felt so betrayed. ""You lied to me."" she said.

""I'm sorry. The guilt was eating away at me. I figured let me just leave you here on earth so you can go on and be happy now."" he said. She was speechless. She thought about it for a moment. She then said, ""I forgive you."" 

""You do?"" he asked. ""Yes. I forgive you."" she said. ""Now, I have something to confess to you too. Wait here, and I'll be right back.""

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the ""Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. You're given the choice: take the drug or die. 

The man decided he had enough, and wanted to die. He declined his dose of the drug and decided to live out his last days at home. His wife, however, was not ready to let him go. She begged him to take the drug. He refused. She was devastated. She had already taken her dose, and was going to live on now without him. She decided to take matters into her own hands. One morning, she was making breakfast. He thought it was going to be his last breakfast. He was sitting at the table, and she was cooking. When he wasn't looking, the woman poured the drug into his tea. She then brought his cup to him where he was seated. He took a sip of his tea, and then another. He was quiet, thinking about his last day on earth. ""Listen honey, there's something I want to confess."" he said. ""I've been cheating on you."" She was shocked. ""With who?"" she asked. ""With my secretary."" he said. She was furious. She felt so betrayed. ""You lied to me."" she said.

""I'm sorry. The guilt was eating away at me. I figured let me just leave you here on earth so you can go on and be happy now."" he said. She was speechless. She thought about it for a moment. She then said, ""I forgive you."" 

""You do?"" he asked. ""Yes. I forgive you."" she said. ""Now, I have something to confess to you too. Wait here, and I'll be right back."" 

""But I don't have much time,"" the man said. ""I know, but I'll be right back."" she said. ""Just wait here. And...think.""
