You end up calling the number and a voice that sounds exactly like JFK answers. You get nervous and pause for a few seconds before telling the voice on the other line about the letter you received. The other voice explains to you that he actually is John F. Kennedy. He explains that both he and his son had their deaths staged to help escape the famous life. They now live on a secret island that is located in Europe.

You ask JFK how he can prove that and he tells you to check your email. In your email there is a video of JFK with his wallet out. He has his old license from the 1960s as well as old family photos. Nobody else could have access to this material.

You ask JFK why he sent you the letter and left you his number. He explains that he is trying to start an underground project that will help prevent people like Donald Trump from ever getting elected again. He has a way to rig elections that will help benefit the US people. He feels it's his duty to help put the right people in position to lead the country since he bailed on the US people 50 years ago. You tell JFK that as much as you'd love to see that result, you'd be going against fair and square democracy. You politely decline and tell him you wish him the best in the future.

The other voice explains to you that he actually is John F. Kennedy. He explains that both he and his son had their deaths staged to help escape the famous life. They now live on a secret island that is located in Europe.

You ask JFK how he can prove that and he tells you to check your email. In your email there is a video of JFK with his wallet out. He has his old license from the 1960s as well as old family photos. Nobody else could have access to this material.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

You look at the letter and figure that you're being pranked. It's signed JFK. That must mean John F. Kennedy. He has been dead for decades. His death is viewable on YouTube. His head was literally exploded into pieces. You go to bed and wake up the next day and your mind can't stop thinking about the letter.

You end up calling the number and a voice that sounds exactly like JFK answers. You get nervous and pause for a few seconds before telling the voice on the other line about the letter you received. The other voice explains to you that he actually is John F. Kennedy. He explains that both he and his son had their deaths staged to help escape the famous life. They now live on a secret island that is located in Europe.

You ask JFK how he can prove that and he tells you to check your email. In your email there is a video of JFK with his wallet out. He has his old license from the 1960s as well as old family photos. Nobody else could have access to this material.

You ask JFK why he sent you the letter and left you his number. He explains that he is trying to start an underground project that will help prevent people like Donald Trump from ever getting elected again. He has a way to rig elections that will help benefit the US people. He feels it's his duty to help put the right people in position to lead the country since he bailed on the US people 50 years ago. You tell JFK that as much as you'd love to see that result, you'd be going against fair and square democracy. You politely decline and tell him you wish him the best in the future.
