You are one of the few people who are not affected by the drug.
 But you have seen how this drug has totally decimated others. For example, a good friend of yours who is younger than you is obese because she cannot stop stuffing food into her face. Another one of your friends has gone bankrupt buying herself 100 houses since she feels extreme anxiety about not having enough housing to live in.

 You want to save humanity from itself. You want to stop this drug from ever being used again.

You have decided to create a new drug that will counteract the effects of the immortality drug.

The friend who is bankrupt from all her houses starts selling them off like crazy, thus vastly improving her net worth. The friend who is a hoarder gives all her clothes to the homeless.

You have decided to create a new drug that will counteract the effects of the immortality drug.

The friend who is bankrupt from all her houses starts selling them off like crazy, thus vastly improving her net worth. The friend who is a hoarder gives all her clothes to the homeless.
