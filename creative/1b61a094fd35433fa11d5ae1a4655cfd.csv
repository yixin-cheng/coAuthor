Obama is baffled but very curious. He agrees to take the job. What else is there to do? Being retired is kind of boring.  He is whisked off to Russia to meet with JFK. 

He is brought into an old warehouse and is shocked to find that JFK is a cyborg. He looks great for his age though. 
""Welcome to the team Barack."" said JFK.


Obama then shakes his firm, robotic hand. 

""So how do I become President? Putin will not step down.""

JFK then leads Obama into a lab at the back of the warehouse. There is a large machine with lots of blades and syringes that is designed for someone to stand in. 

""We will make you look like Putin, then the country is yours"" said JFK.

""No, in Russia. JFK has been secretly running things there for decades. He needs you to take over for Putin."" said the Russian. 

Obama is baffled but very curious. He agrees to take the job. What else is there to do? Being retired is kind of boring.  He is whisked off to Russia to meet with JFK. 

He is brought into an old warehouse and is shocked to find that JFK is a cyborg. He looks great for his age though. 
""Welcome to the team Barack."" said JFK.


Obama then shakes his firm, robotic hand. 

""So how do I become President? Putin will not step down.""

JFK then leads Obama into a lab at the back of the warehouse. There is a large machine with lots of blades and syringes that is designed for someone to stand in. 

""We will make you look like Putin, then the country is yours"" said JFK. 

""It's better than just golfing, right?"" said Obama.
