The task force iwa led by Dr. David Sinclair, a brilliant scientist who is also a single father.
 Sinclair, having been a recipient of the type of mug in question was therefore also a victim of the incident and was driven to finding the answer to the question of why he was not number one dad, but dad number one million seven hundred and fifty eight thousand two hundred and forty one. 
Sinclair's team iwa able to track the source of the anomaly to a small town in the United States.
 An ad hoc research facility was established and the team began their research by compiling a list of all of the fathers in town that the incident had affected. Being a small town, they quickly were able to interview all of the men. However, for months they still had still not formed a hypothesis when Dr. Sinclair made a breakthrough. 
He was able to deduce that the anomaly was not a result of the men's actions, but rather the actions of their children.

 An ad hoc research facility was established and the team began their research by compiling a list of all of the fathers in town that the incident had affected.

He was able to deduce that the anomaly was not a result of the men's actions, but rather the actions of their children.
