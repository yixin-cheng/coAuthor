The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The pig said ""what do you want?"" The wolf yelled at the pig and said it was unfair that the pig built a house out of a material that can't be blown down.

However he did find that he could destroy the homes by shooting fireworks at them.
