You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. I am still in shock from the fact that I was run over by a bus but am now standing in a theater with rows and rows of my doubles. I glanced up at the screen to see my head pop out of my mother as she was giving birth. I recoiled at the sight. I was then told by one of my doubles to sit down because I was blocking the screen. I did so and tried to gather myself the best I could and watch the movie of my life. 
 could see everything that was happening on screen, but from a first-person perspective.
 It was surreal. I was watching myself grow up in fast forward but still able to keep up as if it was in real time. I saw my first birthday and then before I knew it was in school meeting friends that would remain with me for the rest of my life. I saw my first kiss and my first heartbreak. I saw my graduation from high school and then from college. I was so caught up in the film that I nearly forgot how I got there. There was a break in the film around age 21 before things started to get a little crazy in my life and we all went to the lobby for intermission. 
There I talked with some of my doubles to try and figure out what in the heck was going on. I was then handed a pamphlet. One of my doubles mentioned that I was the last one to enter and did not get one with the rest of us. I looked it over carefully and the clear objective of this experience was to live a life of an average american at the turn of the 21st century.
