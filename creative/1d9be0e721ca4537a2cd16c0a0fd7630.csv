You look down, and notice an opened drawer with stacks of crisp hundred dollar bills. You glance up, expecting to see a security camera. It is there, but the lens is smeared with honey. You grab some cash and run. The bees follow you.

 You decide to buy a new car. You head to the Mercedes dealership. The salesman looks at you funny, and you realize that you're covered in bees again. Terrifies, the salesman hands you a set of keys, gestures art a nearby car and says something about a test drive. You get in a car and drive away, a million and one bees in the back seat.

Let's see. You are now flush with cash, driving a fancy car, and the leader of an amoral swarm of pretty scary insects. What's next?
You decide to go to the mall.
 Soon, you have several trendy outfits. You also have a lot of bees. After a long and active day, you feel very tired. The bees seems tired too. You head back to your new house, and the bees follow. You get in bed, and the bees get in bed with you. You fall asleep, and they fall asleep.

You look down, and notice an opened drawer with stacks of crisp hundred dollar bills. You glance up, expecting to see a security camera. It is there, but the lens is smeared with honey. You grab some cash and run. The bees follow you.

 You decide to buy a new car. You head to the Mercedes dealership. The salesman looks at you funny, and you realize that you're covered in bees again. Terrifies, the salesman hands you a set of keys, gestures at a nearby car and says something about a test drive. You get in a car and drive away, a million and one bees in the back seat.
