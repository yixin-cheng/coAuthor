You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand. Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?""

I looked up into the sky. Am i just hearing things. I look around the park and dont see anyone else talking to bugs, so i must just be sick or tired maybe. I think to myself, ""Oh great, am i delusional? Thats great, right before my first day of college im talking to bees. Just at that moment, the bug repeats again. ""Your Majesty, what are your orders? I looked straight at the bee in the eyes and didnt know what to say. ""You talking to me?"". Was the first thing I could think of. The bee says nothing. Then a couple seconds later the bee repeats ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"". ""If you dont tell me your orders than I am going to worry about you"". Why would this little tiny bee be worried about me, i dont get it? I just stood there looking at it and then i started laughing. ""Your already my best friend and I can barely even see you."" I said. ""Your Majesty, please give me a name so that I know what to identify you as"". Jordan, i told the bee. ""Hey bee, you want to get out of here and hang out. You dont have to grand any of my orders, just be cool"". I said. ""Your Majesty, is that an order? To be cool?"". asked the bee. I looked at the bee and said ""dont call me majesty, call me Jordan"".",1476,[],3,3,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,1352
