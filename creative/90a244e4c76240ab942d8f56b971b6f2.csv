You're sure that if you watch too long you'll lose yourself completely. Maybe this is a way to control your fate, you wonder... Thinking on this you realize that you could never command control forever; eventually you'd lose focus, fall asleep, get hit by a bus... you could never have control forever, but you could have it for a moment.

The movie picks up exactly where you watched it last, no change despite hearing it in the background! Now you're sure that you must succumb to the story.
