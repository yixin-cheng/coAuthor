I got very scared and I swiped the bee off of me and I started to run away. I ran for 2 miles down our back road

 I was so scared. I was running so fast, I didn't know where I was going. I ended up running into a tree and I fell down. After I ran into the tree I passed out and woke up in the hospital. I was in the hospital for 3 days. I ended up with a small amount of brain damage and now I'm deaf in my left ear.

I finally returned home from the hospital, I was so happy to be home. I was so happy to be back with my family. I will never forget that day I ran away from the Bee.

 I was so scared. I was running so fast, I didn't know where I was going. I ended up running into a tree and I fell down. After I ran into the tree I passed out and woke up in the hospital. I was in the hospital for 3 days. I ended up with a small amount of brain damage and now I'm deaf in my left ear.

I finally returned home from the hospital, I was so happy to be home. I was so happy to be back with my family. I will never forget that day I ran away from the Bee. I will never forget the day I ran into the tree. I will never forget the day I got brain damage. I will never forget the day I got deaf in my left ear. 

I learned that I might as well stay inside to avoid further deafness, brain damage and the possibility of being stung by a bee. I have since found a job online to work from home. I only leave my house for groceries and the occasional trip to the doctor. I will be very careful when I am outside in the future.",1350,[],1,1,5,30,0.3,1,0,0,1330
