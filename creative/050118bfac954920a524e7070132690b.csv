She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

One day, she turns over in bed and there is a stranger beside her.  She holds onto her self-control and slowly, so as not to wake him, she gets out of bed.  She grabs her phone as she leaves the bedroom heading for the bathroom, the only place with a door that will lock.  She phones the police.

he police arrive and she tells them her story.
  Right in the middle of it her boyfriend emerges from the bedroom and denies there's anyone else in there.  The police search.  They give her a gimlet stare.  They pull her boyfriend aside and suggest a visit to the ER is in order since it appears she has hallucinated.

So, he's got a choice, after the police leave he can tell her the truth, or he can take her to the ER and have them check out her mental state because the police are convinced she's a nut case and he's got to get her to the ER before she does something crazy.  What a dilemma, what should he do? 
THe decides to play for time.  He'll take her to the ER, let them run a few tests, bring her home and see how things go.  He didn't find that things went so smoothly though.  The ER doc insisted she be admitted for observation.  He ordered a multitude of expensive and painful tests.
