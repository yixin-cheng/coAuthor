The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" He wondered where he got it. Maybe there is some actual good uranium left that he could sell and get rich. Then he wouldn't have to pull these long shifts blowing down the houses of little pigs. 

""Where did you find this uranium to build your house?"" the wolf asked.

The pig got on the phone and called a wolf rental service. He said he'd need an extra big one because his house was made of uranium. He then began packing his bags.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" He wondered where he got it. Maybe there is some actual good uranium left that he could sell and get rich. Then he wouldn't have to pull these long shifts blowing down the houses of little pigs. 

""Where did you find this uranium to build your house?"" the wolf asked. 
""In my house,"" replied the little pig.


That baffled the wolf. Was this a magic house of some kind?

 The wolf was confused. He looked around and it was no different inside than any other house he had blown down. 
""I'm sorry, but I don't see anything special about this house.
"" said the wolf. 

The pig then pointed to a door and said the source is in there. The greedy wolf quickly walked inside. As soon as he did, the pig slammed the door shut and trapped him inside. The wolf angrily howled and tried to get out, but the uranium door wouldn't budge. He tried huffing and puffing it down but it was no use. The wolf was trapped!

The pig got on the phone and called a wolf rental service. He said he'd need an extra big one because his house was made of uranium. He then began packing his bags.

""What are you doing?!"" screamed the wolf. 

The pig informed him that he actually had just sold the land and needed to have the house torn down before the deal would be finalized.
