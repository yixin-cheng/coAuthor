Meanwhile, on the alien vessel, the aliens run into some problems. Matt Damon has been sitting around, eating like a pig, living the conspicuous lifestyle he's grown used to, and the carbon dioxide levels on the ship have been rising rapidly. Realizing ransom isn't a possibility, the aliens frantically search for a way to get rid of him. They end up flying across the universe, and dumping him into a black hole. This later leads to the collapse of an entire galaxy, but that's much later, so for the time being they're okay.

Soon, the Earth is a utopian society. And humanity has Matt Damon to thank for it. Or more properly, his absence. They consider locating his abductors to thank them, but decide that curing cancer and ascending to the next phase of human evolution is more important.

Meanwhile, on the alien vessel, the aliens run into some problems. Matt Damon has been sitting around, eating like a pig, living the conspicuous lifestyle he's grown used to, and the carbon dioxide levels on the ship have been rising rapidly. Realizing ransom isn't a possibility, the aliens frantically search for a way to get rid of him. They end up flying across the universe, and dumping him into a black hole. This later leads to the collapse of an entire galaxy, but that's much later, so for the time being they're okay.
