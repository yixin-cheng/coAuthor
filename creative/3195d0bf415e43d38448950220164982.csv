I stop her and confront her about what is happening. She tells me that I'm not a bee, I'm a human. I look between her and the bee, trying to understand who I should trust. The bee then asks me to follow him and he'll prove my destiny to me. 

With my mother in tears, I follow the bee. He leads me to the hive, where I see thousands of bees working together to create a beautiful home. It's a home bigger than my own! I step inside and see there is even furniture that they had created. 

I sit down in a chair and look around, unable to believe what is happening. The bee then comes up to me and whispers into my ear. ""Your Majesty, we have been waiting for you for so long.""

""Why have you been waiting for me? What can I do to help you?"" I asked.""We need you to lead us.

I can't believe what I've heard. I'm a King. A king of the bees! I'm going to be the best bee king there ever was! Just then, my mother approaches and see what is happening. She immediately lunges toward the bee in an attempt to kill it. 

I stop her and confront her about what is happening. She tells me that I'm not a bee, I'm a human. I look between her and the bee, trying to understand who I should trust. The bee then asks me to follow him and he'll prove my destiny to me. 

With my mother in tears, I follow the bee. He leads me to the hive, where I see thousands of bees working together to create a beautiful home. It's a home bigger than my own! I step inside and see there is even furniture that they had created. 

I sit down in a chair and look around, unable to believe what is happening. The bee then comes up to me and whispers into my ear. ""Your Majesty, we have been waiting for you for so long.""

""Why have you been waiting for me? What can I do to help you?"" I asked.""We need you to lead us.

I stop her and confront her about what is happening. She tells me that I'm not a bee, I'm a human. I look between her and the bee, trying to understand who I should trust. The bee then asks me to follow him and he'll prove my destiny to me. 

With my mother in tears, I follow the bee. He leads me to the hive, where I see thousands of bees working together to create a beautiful home. It's a home bigger than my own! I step inside and see there is even furniture that they had created. 

I sit down in a chair and look around, unable to believe what is happening. The bee then comes up to me and whispers into my ear. ""Your Majesty, we have been waiting for you for so long.""

""Why have you been waiting for me? What can I do to help you?"" I asked.""We need you to lead us.

I can't believe what I've heard. I'm a King. A king of the bees! I'm going to be the best bee king there ever was! Just then, my mother approaches and see what is happening. She immediately lunges toward the bee in an attempt to kill it. 

I stop her and confront her about what is happening. She tells me that I'm not a bee, I'm a human. I look between her and the bee, trying to understand who I should trust. The bee then asks me to follow him and he'll prove my destiny to me. 

With my mother in tears, I follow the bee. He leads me to the hive, where I see thousands of bees working together to create a beautiful home. It's a home bigger than my own! I step inside and see there is even furniture that they had created. 

I sit down in a chair and look around, unable to believe what is happening. The bee then comes up to me and whispers into my ear. ""Your Majesty, we have been waiting for you for so long.""

""Why have you been waiting for me? What can I do to help you?"" I asked.""We need you to lead us.
"" the bee said. 

I felt a sense of pride. That quickly turned to fear though as I watched the bees begin to cover the front door. They then begin to construct restraints, holding me in place.

I can't believe what I've heard. I'm a King. A king of the bees! I'm going to be the best bee king there ever was! Just then, my mother approaches and see what is happening. She immediately lunges toward the bee in an attempt to kill it. 

I stop her and confront her about what is happening. She tells me that I'm not a bee, I'm a human. I look between her and the bee, trying to understand who I should trust. The bee then asks me to follow him and he'll prove my destiny to me. 

With my mother in tears, I follow the bee. He leads me to the hive, where I see thousands of bees working together to create a beautiful home. It's a home bigger than my own! I step inside and see there is even furniture that they had created. 

I sit down in a chair and look around, unable to believe what is happening. The bee then comes up to me and whispers into my ear. ""Your Majesty, we have been waiting for you for so long.""

""Why have you been waiting for me? What can I do to help you?"" I asked.""We need you to lead us.

I felt a sense of pride. That quickly turned to fear though as I watched the bees begin to cover the front door. They then begin to construct restraints, holding me in place.

I stop her and confront her about what is happening. She tells me that I'm not a bee, I'm a human. I look between her and the bee, trying to understand who I should trust. The bee then asks me to follow him and he'll prove my destiny to me. 

With my mother in tears, I follow the bee. He leads me to the hive, where I see thousands of bees working together to create a beautiful home. It's a home bigger than my own! I step inside and see there is even furniture that they had created. 

I sit down in a chair and look around, unable to believe what is happening. The bee then comes up to me and whispers into my ear. ""Your Majesty, we have been waiting for you for so long.""

""Why have you been waiting for me? What can I do to help you?"" I asked.""We need you to lead us.
"" the bee said. 

I felt a sense of pride. That quickly turned to fear though as I watched the bees begin to cover the front door. They then begin to construct restraints, holding me in place. 

""We can't have you leaving us ever again"" said the bee.

I can't believe what I've heard. I'm a King. A king of the bees! I'm going to be the best bee king there ever was! Just then, my mother approaches and see what is happening. She immediately lunges toward the bee in an attempt to kill it. 

I stop her and confront her about what is happening. She tells me that I'm not a bee, I'm a human. I look between her and the bee, trying to understand who I should trust. The bee then asks me to follow him and he'll prove my destiny to me. 

With my mother in tears, I follow the bee. He leads me to the hive, where I see thousands of bees working together to create a beautiful home. It's a home bigger than my own! I step inside and see there is even furniture that they had created. 

I sit down in a chair and look around, unable to believe what is happening. The bee then comes up to me and whispers into my ear. ""Your Majesty, we have been waiting for you for so long.""

""Why have you been waiting for me? What can I do to help you?"" I asked.""We need you to lead us.
"" the bee said. 

I felt a sense of pride. That quickly turned to fear though as I watched the bees begin to cover the front door. They then begin to construct restraints, holding me in place.

I'm shocked and don't know what to do. Did the bee really just talk? I asked the bee why it called me that. 

""Sir, you are the king of the bees. We've been trying to contact you since you were a child""

I can't believe what I've heard. I'm a King. A king of the bees! I'm going to be the best bee king there ever was! Just then, my mother approaches and see what is happening. She immediately lunges toward the bee in an attempt to kill it. 

I stop her and confront her about what is happening. She tells me that I'm not a bee, I'm a human. I look between her and the bee, trying to understand who I should trust. The bee then asks me to follow him and he'll prove my destiny to me. 

With my mother in tears, I follow the bee. He leads me to the hive, where I see thousands of bees working together to create a beautiful home. It's a home bigger than my own! I step inside and see there is even furniture that they had created. 

I sit down in a chair and look around, unable to believe what is happening. The bee then comes up to me and whispers into my ear. ""Your Majesty, we have been waiting for you for so long.""

""Why have you been waiting for me? What can I do to help you?"" I asked.""We need you to lead us.
"" the bee said. 

I felt a sense of pride. That quickly turned to fear though as I watched the bees begin to cover the front door. They then begin to construct restraints, holding me in place. 

""We can't have you leaving us ever again"" said the bee.

""Sir, you are the king of the bees. We've been trying to contact you since you were a child""

I can't believe what I've heard. I'm a King. A king of the bees! I'm going to be the best bee king there ever was! Just then, my mother approaches and see what is happening. She immediately lunges toward the bee in an attempt to kill it. 

I stop her and confront her about what is happening. She tells me that I'm not a bee, I'm a human. I look between her and the bee, trying to understand who I should trust. The bee then asks me to follow him and he'll prove my destiny to me. 

With my mother in tears, I follow the bee. He leads me to the hive, where I see thousands of bees working together to create a beautiful home. It's a home bigger than my own! I step inside and see there is even furniture that they had created. 

I sit down in a chair and look around, unable to believe what is happening. The bee then comes up to me and whispers into my ear. ""Your Majesty, we have been waiting for you for so long.""

""Why have you been waiting for me? What can I do to help you?"" I asked.""We need you to lead us.
"" the bee said. 

I felt a sense of pride. That quickly turned to fear though as I watched the bees begin to cover the front door. They then begin to construct restraints, holding me in place.

""Sir, you are the king of the bees. We've been trying to contact you since you were a child""

I can't believe what I've heard. I'm a King. A king of the bees! I'm going to be the best bee king there ever was! Just then, my mother approaches and see what is happening. She immediately lunges toward the bee in an attempt to kill it. 

I stop her and confront her about what is happening. She tells me that I'm not a bee, I'm a human. I look between her and the bee, trying to understand who I should trust. The bee then asks me to follow him and he'll prove my destiny to me. 

With my mother in tears, I follow the bee. He leads me to the hive, where I see thousands of bees working together to create a beautiful home. It's a home bigger than my own! I step inside and see there is even furniture that they had created. 

I sit down in a chair and look around, unable to believe what is happening. The bee then comes up to me and whispers into my ear. ""Your Majesty, we have been waiting for you for so long.""

""Why have you been waiting for me? What can I do to help you?"" I asked.""We need you to lead us.
"" the bee said. 

I felt a sense of pride. That quickly turned to fear though as I watched the bees begin to cover the front door. They then begin to construct restraints, holding me in place. 

""We can't have you leaving us ever again"" said the bee.

I'm shocked and don't know what to do. Did the bee really just talk? I asked the bee why it called me that. 

""Sir, you are the king of the bees. We've been trying to contact you since you were a child""

I can't believe what I've heard. I'm a King. A king of the bees! I'm going to be the best bee king there ever was! Just then, my mother approaches and see what is happening. She immediately lunges toward the bee in an attempt to kill it. 

I stop her and confront her about what is happening. She tells me that I'm not a bee, I'm a human. I look between her and the bee, trying to understand who I should trust. The bee then asks me to follow him and he'll prove my destiny to me. 

With my mother in tears, I follow the bee. He leads me to the hive, where I see thousands of bees working together to create a beautiful home. It's a home bigger than my own! I step inside and see there is even furniture that they had created. 

I sit down in a chair and look around, unable to believe what is happening. The bee then comes up to me and whispers into my ear. ""Your Majesty, we have been waiting for you for so long.""

""Why have you been waiting for me? What can I do to help you?"" I asked.""We need you to lead us.
"" the bee said. 

I felt a sense of pride. That quickly turned to fear though as I watched the bees begin to cover the front door. They then begin to construct restraints, holding me in place. 

""We can't have you leaving us ever again"" said the bee.

I stop her and confront her about what is happening. She tells me that I'm not a bee, I'm a human. I look between her and the bee, trying to understand who I should trust. The bee then asks me to follow him and he'll prove my destiny to me. 

With my mother in tears, I follow the bee. He leads me to the hive, where I see thousands of bees working together to create a beautiful home. It's a home bigger than my own! I step inside and see there is even furniture that they had created. 

I sit down in a chair and look around, unable to believe what is happening. The bee then comes up to me and whispers into my ear. ""Your Majesty, we have been waiting for you for so long.""

""Why have you been waiting for me? What can I do to help you?"" I asked.""We need you to lead us.
"" the bee said. 

I felt a sense of pride. That quickly turned to fear though as I watched the bees begin to cover the front door. They then begin to construct restraints, holding me in place.

I can't believe what I've heard. I'm a King. A king of the bees! I'm going to be the best bee King there ever was! Just then, my mother approaches and see what is happening. She immediately lunges toward the bee in an attempt to kill it. 

I stop her and confront her about what is happening. She tells me that I'm not a bee, I'm a human. I look between her and the bee, trying to understand who I should trust. The bee then asks me to follow him and he'll prove my destiny to me. 

With my mother in tears, I follow the bee. He leads me to the hive, where I see thousands of bees working together to create a beautiful home. It's a home bigger than my own! I step inside and see there is even furniture that they had created. 

I sit down in a chair and look around, unable to believe what is happening. The bee then comes up to me and whispers into my ear. ""Your Majesty, we have been waiting for you for so long.""

""Why have you been waiting for me? What can I do to help you?"" I asked.""We need you to lead us.
"" the bee said. 

I felt a sense of pride. That quickly turned to fear though as I watched the bees begin to cover the front door. They then begin to construct restraints, holding me in place. 

""We can't have you leaving us ever again"" said the bee.
