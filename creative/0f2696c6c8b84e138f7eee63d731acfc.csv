I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

I have been a father now for 7 years.  I had my son 7 years ago.  I had my daughter 4 years ago.  I'm certainly not a perfect dad, but I do the best that I can.  I am there for every recital and pee-wee league game.  I am the one who makes the snacks and brings them to school.  I work quite a bit, but I always make sacrifices for me kids.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

I have been a father now for 7 years.  I had my son 7 years ago.  I had my daughter 4 years ago.  I'm certainly not a perfect dad, but I do the best that I can.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

I have been a father now for 7 years.  I had my son 7 years ago.  I had my daughter 4 years ago.  I'm certainly not a perfect dad, but I do the best that I can.  I am there for every recital and pee-wee league game.  I am the one who makes the snacks and brings them to school.  I work quite a bit, but I always make sacrifices for me kids.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

I have been a father now for 7 years.  I had my son 7 years ago.  I had my daughter 4 years ago.  I'm certainly not a perfect dad, but I do the best that I can.  I am there for every recital and pee-wee league game.  I am the one who makes the snacks and brings them to school.  I work quite a bit, but I always make sacrifices for me kids.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

I have been a father now for 7 years.  I had my son 7 years ago.  I had my daughter 4 years ago.  I'm certainly not a perfect dad, but I do the best that I can.  I am there for every recital and pee-wee league game.  I am the one who makes the snacks and brings them to school.  I work quite a bit, but I always make sacrifices for me kids.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

I am there for every recital and pee-wee league game.  I am the one who makes the snacks and brings them to school.  I work quite a bit, but I always make sacrifices for me kids.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.


hat day, I decided to take my mug with me into work.

I have been a father now for 7 years.  I had my son 7 years ago.  I had my daughter 4 years ago.  I'm certainly not a perfect dad, but I do the best that I can.  I am there for every recital and pee-wee league game.  I am the one who makes the snacks and brings them to school.  I work quite a bit, but I always make sacrifices for me kids.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

I have been a father now for 7 years.  I had my son 7 years ago.  I had my daughter 4 years ago.  I'm certainly not a perfect dad, but I do the best that I can.  I am there for every recital and pee-wee league game.  I am the one who makes the snacks and brings them to school.  I work quite a bit, but I always make sacrifices for me kids.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

I have been a father now for 7 years.  I had my son 7 years ago.  I had my daughter 4 years ago.  I'm certainly not a perfect dad, but I do the best that I can.  I am there for every recital and pee-wee league game.  I am the one who makes the snacks and brings them to school.  I work quite a bit, but I always make sacrifices for me kids.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

My office buddy Tim had a mug that said ""#20 Dad"".   My office worker Sam, who no one likes, had a mug that said ""#Invalid Dad"".  We weren't",1389,[],1,1,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,1703

I have been a father now for 7 years.  I had my son 7 years ago.  I had my daughter 4 years ago.  I'm certainly not a perfect dad, but I do the best that I can.  I am there for every recital and pee-wee league game.  I am the one who makes the snacks and brings them to school.  I work quite a bit, but I always make sacrifices for me kids.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

I have been a father now for 7 years.  I had my son 7 years ago.  I had my daughter 4 years ago.  I'm certainly not a perfect dad, but I do the best that I can.  I am there for every recital and pee-wee league game.  I am the one who makes the snacks and brings them to school.  I work quite a bit, but I always make sacrifices for me kids.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

I have been a father now for 7 years.  I had my son 7 years ago.  I had my daughter 4 years ago.  I'm certainly not a perfect dad, but I do the best that I can.  I am there for every recital and pee-wee league game.  I am the one who makes the snacks and brings them to school.  I work quite a bit, but I always make sacrifices for me kids.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.


hat day, I decided to take my mug with me into work.
  A lot of the other fathers at work happened to bring their coffee mugs in as well.  I saw a variety of different numbers on the mugs.  My boss Jeff had a mug that said ""#1,000,000,000 Dad"".  My office buddy Tim had a mug that said ""#20 Dad"".   My office worker Sam, who no one likes, had a mug that said ""#Invalid Dad"".  I wasn't sure what that meant.

I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

My office buddy Tim had a mug that said ""#20 Dad"".   My office worker Sam, who no one likes, had a mug that said ""#Invalid Dad"".  I wasn't sure what that meant.  

There was clearly something going on with the #1 Dad mugs.  Maybe , these mugs were ",1497,[],0,1,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,1978

I have been a father now for 7 years.  I had my son 7 years ago.  I had my daughter 4 years ago.  I'm certainly not a perfect dad, but I do the best that I can.  I am there for every recital and pee-wee league game.  I am the one who makes the snacks and brings them to school.  I work quite a bit, but I always make sacrifices for me kids.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

  A lot of the other fathers at work happened to bring their coffee mugs in as well.  I saw a variety of different numbers on the mugs.  My boss Jeff had a mug that said ""#1,000,000,000 Dad"".

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.


hat day, I decided to take my mug with me into work.
  A lot of the other fathers at work happened to bring their coffee mugs in as well.  I saw a variety of different numbers on the mugs.  My boss Jeff had a mug that said ""#1,000,000,000 Dad"".  My office buddy Tim had a mug that said ""#20 Dad"".   My office worker Sam, who no one likes, had a mug that said ""#Invalid Dad"".  I wasn't sure what that meant.  

There was clearly something going on with the #1 Dad mugs.  Maybe , these mugs were telling us how we truly ranked in this world as dads?  I was not a #1 Dad--according to the mug.  I started to worry a bit about my standing.  Wh",1642,[],0,0,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,2147

I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.


hat day, I decided to take my mug with me into work.
  A lot of the other fathers at work happened to bring their coffee mugs in as well.  I saw a variety of different numbers on the mugs.  My boss Jeff had a mug that said ""#1,000,000,000 Dad"".

I am there for every recital and pee-wee league game.  I am the one who makes the snacks and brings them to school.  I work quite a bit, but I always make sacrifices for me kids.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.


hat day, I decided to take my mug with me into work.
  A lot of the other fathers at work happened to bring their coffee mugs in as well.  I saw a variety of different numbers on the mugs.  My boss Jeff had a mug that said ""#1,000,000,000 Dad"".  My office buddy Tim had a mug that said ""#20 Dad"".   My office worker Sam, who no one likes, had a mug that said ""#Invalid Dad"".  I wasn't sure what that meant.  

There was clearly something going on with the #1 Dad mugs.  Maybe , these mugs were telling us how we truly ranked in this world as dads?  I was not a #1 Dad--according to the mug.  I started to worry a bit about my standing.  Was I a bad father?  How is this ranked?  Then, I received a text fr",1708,[],0,0,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,2219

hat day, I decided to take my mug with me into work.
  A lot of the other fathers at work happened to bring their coffee mugs in as well.  I saw a variety of different numbers on the mugs.  My boss Jeff had a mug that said ""#1,000,000,000 Dad"".  My office buddy Tim had a mug that said ""#20 Dad"".   My office worker Sam, who no one likes, had a mug that said ""#Invalid Dad"".  I wasn't sure what that meant.  

There was clearly something going on with the #1 Dad mugs.  Maybe , these mugs were telling us how we truly ranked in this world as dads?  I was not a #1 Dad--according to the mug.  I started to worry a bit about my standing.  Was I a bad father?  How is this ranked?  Then, I received a text from my daughter",1722,[],0,0,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,2233

I have been a father now for 7 years.  I had my son 7 years ago.  I had my daughter 4 years ago.  I'm certainly not a perfect dad, but I do the best that I can.  I am there for every recital and pee-wee league game.  I am the one who makes the snacks and brings them to school.  I work quite a bit, but I always make sacrifices for me kids.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.

My office buddy Tim had a mug that said ""#20 Dad"".   My office worker Sam, who no one likes, had a mug that said ""#Invalid Dad"".  I wasn't sure what that meant.  

There was clearly something going on with the #1 Dad mugs.  Maybe , these mugs were telling us how we truly ranked in this world as dads?  I was not a #1 Dad--according to the mug.  I started to worry a bit about my standing.  Was I a bad father?  How is this ranked?  Then, I received a text from my daughter and son.  IT ",1736,[],0,0,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,2247

I have been a father now for 7 years.  I had my son 7 years ago.  I had my daughter 4 years ago.  I'm certainly not a perfect dad, but I do the best that I can.  I am there for every recital and pee-wee league game.  I am the one who makes the snacks and brings them to school.  I work quite a bit, but I always make sacrifices for me kids.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

My office buddy Tim had a mug that said ""#20 Dad"".   My office worker Sam, who no one likes, had a mug that said ""#Invalid Dad"".  I wasn't sure what that meant.  

There was clearly something going on with the #1 Dad mugs.  Maybe , these mugs were telling us how we truly ranked in this world as dads?  I was not a #1 Dad--according to the mug.  I started to worry a bit about my standing.  Was I a bad father?  How is this ranked?  Then, I received a text from my daughter and son.  It was ",1740,[],0,0,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,2261
2262,text-insert,user,1630413731327,"{'ops': [{'retain': 1740}, {'insert': 'a'}]}",,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly.

I have been a father now for 7 years.  I had my son 7 years ago.  I had my daughter 4 years ago.  I'm certainly not a perfect dad, but I do the best that I can.  I am there for every recital and pee-wee league game.  I am the one who makes the snacks and brings them to school.  I work quite a bit, but I always make sacrifices for me kids.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

My office buddy Tim had a mug that said ""#20 Dad"".   My office worker Sam, who no one likes, had a mug that said ""#Invalid Dad"".  I wasn't sure what that meant.  

There was clearly something going on with the #1 Dad mugs.  Maybe , these mugs were telling us how we truly ranked in this world as dads?  I was not a #1 Dad--according to the mug.  I started to worry a bit about my standing.  Was I a bad father?  How is this ranked?  Then, I received a text from my daughter and son.  It was a video from t",1754,[],0,0,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,2275

I have been a father now for 7 years.  I had my son 7 years ago.  I had my daughter 4 years ago.  I'm certainly not a perfect dad, but I do the best that I can.  I am there for every recital and pee-wee league game.  I am the one who makes the snacks and brings them to school.  I work quite a bit, but I always make sacrifices for me kids.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

  A lot of the other fathers at work happened to bring their coffee mugs in as well.  I saw a variety of different numbers on the mugs.  My boss Jeff had a mug that said ""#1,000,000,000 Dad"".  My office buddy Tim had a mug that said ""#20 Dad"".   My office worker Sam, who no one likes, had a mug that said ""#Invalid Dad"".  I wasn't sure what that meant.  

There was clearly something going on with the #1 Dad mugs.  Maybe , these mugs were telling us how we truly ranked in this world as dads?  I was not a #1 Dad--according to the mug.  I started to worry a bit about my standing.  Was I a bad father?  How is this ranked?  Then, I received a text from my daughter and son.  It was a video from them telling ",1766,[],0,0,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,2289

I have been a father now for 7 years.  I had my son 7 years ago.  I had my daughter 4 years ago.  I'm certainly not a perfect dad, but I do the best that I can.  I am there for every recital and pee-wee league game.  I am the one who makes the snacks and brings them to school.  I work quite a bit, but I always make sacrifices for me kids.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.

I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.


hat day, I decided to take my mug with me into work.
  A lot of the other fathers at work happened to bring their coffee mugs in as well.  I saw a variety of different numbers on the mugs.  My boss Jeff had a mug that said ""#1,000,000,000 Dad"".  My office buddy Tim had a mug that said ""#20 Dad"".   My office worker Sam, who no one likes, had a mug that said ""#Invalid Dad"".  I wasn't sure what that meant.  

There was clearly something going on with the #1 Dad mugs.  Maybe , these mugs were telling us how we truly ranked in this world as dads?  I was not a #1 Dad--according to the mug.  I started to worry a bit about my standing.  Was I a bad father?  How is this ranked?  Then, I received a text from my daughter and son.  It was a video from them telling me to ",1772,[],0,0,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,2303

I have been a father now for 7 years.  I had my son 7 years ago.  I had my daughter 4 years ago.  I'm certainly not a perfect dad, but I do the best that I can.  I am there for every recital and pee-wee league game.  I am the one who makes the snacks and brings them to school.  I work quite a bit, but I always make sacrifices for me kids.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

I have been a father now for 7 years.  I had my son 7 years ago.  I had my daughter 4 years ago.  I'm certainly not a perfect dad, but I do the best that I can.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.


hat day, I decided to take my mug with me into work.
  A lot of the other fathers at work happened to bring their coffee mugs in as well.  I saw a variety of different numbers on the mugs.  My boss Jeff had a mug that said ""#1,000,000,000 Dad"".  My office buddy Tim had a mug that said ""#20 Dad"".   My office worker Sam, who no one likes, had a mug that said ""#Invalid Dad"".  I wasn't sure what that meant.  

There was clearly something going on with the #1 Dad mugs.  Maybe , these mugs were telling us how we truly ranked in this world as dads?  I was not a #1 Dad--according to the mug.  I started to worry a bit about my standing.  Was I a bad father?  How is this ranked?  Then, I received a text from my daughter and son.  It was a video from them telling me to have a great day and that they loved me. ",1813,[],0,0,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,2344

I am there for every recital and pee-wee league game.  I am the one who makes the snacks and brings them to school.  I work quite a bit, but I always make sacrifices for me kids.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.


hat day, I decided to take my mug with me into work.
  A lot of the other fathers at work happened to bring their coffee mugs in as well.  I saw a variety of different numbers on the mugs.  My boss Jeff had a mug that said ""#1,000,000,000 Dad"".  My office buddy Tim had a mug that said ""#20 Dad"".   My office worker Sam, who no one likes, had a mug that said ""#Invalid Dad"".  I wasn't sure what that meant.  

There was clearly something going on with the #1 Dad mugs.  Maybe , these mugs were telling us how we truly ranked in this world as dads?  I was not a #1 Dad--according to the mug.  I started to worry a bit about my standing.  Was I a bad father?  How is this ranked?  Then, I received a text from my daughter and son.  It was a video from them telling me to have a great day and that they loved me.  After receiving the text, ",1840,[],0,0,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,2371

hat day, I decided to take my mug with me into work.
  A lot of the other fathers at work happened to bring their coffee mugs in as well.  I saw a variety of different numbers on the mugs.  My boss Jeff had a mug that said ""#1,000,000,000 Dad"".  My office buddy Tim had a mug that said ""#20 Dad"".   My office worker Sam, who no one likes, had a mug that said ""#Invalid Dad"".  I wasn't sure what that meant.  

There was clearly something going on with the #1 Dad mugs.  Maybe , these mugs were telling us how we truly ranked in this world as dads?  I was not a #1 Dad--according to the mug.  I started to worry a bit about my standing.  Was I a bad father?  How is this ranked?  Then, I received a text from my daughter and son.  It was a video from them telling me to have a great day and that they loved me.  After receiving the text, I stopped wor",1853,[],0,0,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,2384

I have been a father now for 7 years.  I had my son 7 years ago.  I had my daughter 4 years ago.  I'm certainly not a perfect dad, but I do the best that I can.  I am there for every recital and pee-wee league game.  I am the one who makes the snacks and brings them to school.  I work quite a bit, but I always make sacrifices for me kids.

I am there for every recital and pee-wee league game.  I am the one who makes the snacks and brings them to school.  I work quite a bit, but I always make sacrifices for me kids.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

I started to worry a bit about my standing.  Was I a bad father?  How is this ranked?  Then, I received a text from my daughter and son.

I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.

  A lot of the other fathers at work happened to bring their coffee mugs in as well.  I saw a variety of different numbers on the mugs.  My boss Jeff had a mug that said ""#1,000,000,000 Dad"".  My office buddy Tim had a mug that said ""#20 Dad"".   My office worker Sam, who no one likes, had a mug that said ""#Invalid Dad"".  I wasn't sure what that meant.  

There was clearly something going on with the #1 Dad mugs.  Maybe , these mugs were telling us how we truly ranked in this world as dads?  I was not a #1 Dad--according to the mug.  I started to worry a bit about my standing.  Was I a bad father?  How is this ranked?  Then, I received a text from my daughter and son.  It was a video from them telling me to have a great day and that they loved me.  After receiving the text, I stopped worrying about what my ranking was.  I wa",1891,[],0,0,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,2424

I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.


hat day, I decided to take my mug with me into work.
  A lot of the other fathers at work happened to bring their coffee mugs in as well.  I saw a variety of different numbers on the mugs.  My boss Jeff had a mug that said ""#1,000,000,000 Dad"".  My office buddy Tim had a mug that said ""#20 Dad"".   My office worker Sam, who no one likes, had a mug that said ""#Invalid Dad"".  I wasn't sure what that meant.  

There was clearly something going on with the #1 Dad mugs.  Maybe , these mugs were telling us how we truly ranked in this world as dads?  I was not a #1 Dad--according to the mug.  I started to worry a bit about my standing.  Was I a bad father?  How is this ranked?  Then, I received a text from my daughter and son.  It was a video from them telling me to have a great day and that they loved me.  After receiving the text, I stopped worrying about what my ranking was.

I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.


hat day, I decided to take my mug with me into work.
  A lot of the other fathers at work happened to bring their coffee mugs in as well.  I saw a variety of different numbers on the mugs.  My boss Jeff had a mug that said ""#1,000,000,000 Dad"".  My office buddy Tim had a mug that said ""#20 Dad"".   My office worker Sam, who no one likes, had a mug that said ""#Invalid Dad"".  I wasn't sure what that meant.  

There was clearly something going on with the #1 Dad mugs.  Maybe , these mugs were telling us how we truly ranked in this world as dads?  I was not a #1 Dad--according to the mug.  I started to worry a bit about my standing.  Was I a bad father?  How is this ranked?  Then, I received a text from my daughter and son.  It was a video from them telling me to have a great day and that they loved me.  After receiving the text, I stopped worrying about what my ranking was.

I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.


hat day, I decided to take my mug with me into work.
  A lot of the other fathers at work happened to bring their coffee mugs in as well.  I saw a variety of different numbers on the mugs.  My boss Jeff had a mug that said ""#1,000,000,000 Dad"".  My office buddy Tim had a mug that said ""#20 Dad"".   My office worker Sam, who no one likes, had a mug that said ""#Invalid Dad"".  I wasn't sure what that meant.  

There was clearly something going on with the #1 Dad mugs.  Maybe , these mugs were telling us how we truly ranked in this world as dads?  I was not a #1 Dad--according to the mug.  I started to worry a bit about my standing.  Was I a bad father?  How is this ranked?  Then, I received a text from my daughter and son.  It was a video from them telling me to have a great day and that they loved me.  After receiving the text, I stopped worrying about what my ranking was.  I was loved and that is all that mattered.

I have been a father now for 7 years.  I had my son 7 years ago.  I had my daughter 4 years ago.  I'm certainly not a perfect dad, but I do the best that I can.  I am there for every recital and pee-wee league game.  I am the one who makes the snacks and brings them to school.  I work quite a bit, but I always make sacrifices for me kids.

When I woke up last week, I noticed my ""#1 Dad"" mug that my kids gave to me changed.  It now had #1,000 on it.  It was early in the morning so I thought my mind was dull due to me just waking up.  I have breakfast with my family every morning.  When I sat down with my mug filled with coffee, my son asked me why my mug looked different.  My wife asked me if I got a new mug.  I told them that this was the same mug that I have had for years.  I wasn't sure why the mug changed.  I know this was not a feature of the mug.  Otherwise, it would have happened years ago.


hat day, I decided to take my mug with me into work.
  A lot of the other fathers at work happened to bring their coffee mugs in as well.  I saw a variety of different numbers on the mugs.  My boss Jeff had a mug that said ""#1,000,000,000 Dad"".  My office buddy Tim had a mug that said ""#20 Dad"".   My office worker Sam, who no one likes, had a mug that said ""#Invalid Dad"".  I wasn't sure what that meant.  

There was clearly something going on with the #1 Dad mugs.  Maybe , these mugs were telling us how we truly ranked in this world as dads?  I was not a #1 Dad--according to the mug.  I started to worry a bit about my standing.  Was I a bad father?  How is this ranked?  Then, I received a text from my daughter and son.  It was a video from them telling me to have a great day and that they loved me.  After receiving the text, I stopped worrying about what my ranking was.    I was loved and that is all that mattered.
