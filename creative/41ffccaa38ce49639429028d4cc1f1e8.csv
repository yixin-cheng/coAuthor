I was in my room, alone and at first I thought a human intruder has come inside the house. But their voice is too high pitched to be human. It was then I realized, the intruder is a tiny bee. I screamed on the top of my lungs.

""Get away from me, get away from me! I am deathly allergic to bees!"" I screamed.

""But that's the thing, Your Majesty. You are not allergic to us. You're one of us."" said the tiny bee.

""That's.. that's impossible! I'm human, my mother was human so is my sister and my father."" I argued as I looked for anything in the room to squat the tiny little thing.

""You have to be quiet. Your mother and father may come and find us."" said the bee.

""That's great for me, they'll kill you!"" I screamed as I quickly got a mathematics book to try and squat the bee. The bee immediately flew over it and landed on my shoulder. I screamed again.

Finally, my mom and dad came knocking on my door. ""Honey, are you okay in there?"" said my mom as she tried to open the door. I heard kicking of the door as I couldn't seem to move at this point. Another kicks later and my dad have finally opened the door.

I was in my room, alone and at first I thought a human intruder has come inside the house. But their voice is too high pitched to be human. It was then I realized, the intruder is a tiny bee. I screamed on the top of my lungs.

""Get away from me, get away from me! I am deathly allergic to bees!"" I screamed.

""But that's the thing, Your Majesty. You are not allergic to us. You're one of us."" said the tiny bee.

""That's.. that's impossible! I'm human, my mother was human so is my sister and my father."" I argued as I looked for anything in the room to squat the tiny little thing.

""You have to be quiet. Your mother and father may come and find us."" said the bee.

""That's great for me, they'll kill you!"" I screamed as I quickly got a mathematics book to try and squat the bee. The bee immediately flew over it and landed on my shoulder. I screamed again.

""Shhhh!"" said the tiny bee as it buzzed on my ear. It then stung me right on my shoulder and I screamed the loudest this time.

Finally, my mom and dad came knocking on my door. ""Honey, are you okay in there?"" said my mom as she tried to open the door. I heard kicking of the door as I couldn't seem to move at this point. Another kicks later and my dad have finally opened the door.

""Honey? We heard screaming. Where are you?"" said my father.

""I'm right here, there is a bee in here!"" I screamed.

I was in my room, alone and at first I thought a human intruder has come inside the house. But their voice is too high pitched to be human. It was then I realized, the intruder is a tiny bee. I screamed on the top of my lungs.

""Get away from me, get away from me! I am deathly allergic to bees!"" I screamed.

""But that's the thing, Your Majesty. You are not allergic to us. You're one of us."" said the tiny bee.

""That's.. that's impossible! I'm human, my mother was human so is my sister and my father."" I argued as I looked for anything in the room to squat the tiny little thing.

""You have to be quiet. Your mother and father may come and find us."" said the bee.

""That's great for me, they'll kill you!"" I screamed as I quickly got a mathematics book to try and squat the bee. The bee immediately flew over it and landed on my shoulder. I screamed again.

""Shhhh!"" said the tiny bee as it buzzed on my ear. It then stung me right on my shoulder and I screamed the loudest this time.

Finally, my mom and dad came knocking on my door. ""Honey, are you okay in there?"" said my mom as she tried to open the door. I heard kicking of the door as I couldn't seem to move at this point. Another kicks later and my dad have finally opened the door.

I was in my room, alone and at first I thought a human intruder has come inside the house. But their voice is too high pitched to be human. It was then I realized, the intruder is a tiny bee. I screamed on the top of my lungs.

""Get away from me, get away from me! I am deathly allergic to bees!"" I screamed.

""But that's the thing, Your Majesty. You are not allergic to us. You're one of us."" said the tiny bee.

""That's.. that's impossible! I'm human, my mother was human so is my sister and my father."" I argued as I looked for anything in the room to squat the tiny little thing.

""You have to be quiet. Your mother and father may come and find us."" said the bee.

""That's great for me, they'll kill you!"" I screamed as I quickly got a mathematics book to try and squat the bee. The bee immediately flew over it and landed on my shoulder. I screamed again.

""Shhhh!"" said the tiny bee as it buzzed on my ear. It then stung me right on my shoulder and I screamed the loudest this time.

Finally, my mom and dad came knocking on my door. ""Honey, are you okay in there?"" said my mom as she tried to open the door. I heard kicking of the door as I couldn't seem to move at this point. Another kicks later and my dad have finally opened the door.

""Honey? We heard screaming. Where are you?"" said my father.

""I'm right here, there is a bee in here!"" I screamed.

You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand. Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?""

I was in my room, alone and at first I thought a human intruder has come inside the house. But their voice is too high pitched to be human. It was then I realized, the intruder is a tiny bee. I screamed on the top of my lungs.

""Get away from me, get away from me! I am deathly allergic to bees!"" I screamed.

""But that's the thing, Your Majesty. You are not allergic to us. You're one of us."" said the tiny bee.

""That's.. that's impossible! I'm human, my mother was human so is my sister and my father."" I argued as I looked for anything in the room to squat the tiny little thing.

""You have to be quiet. Your mother and father may come and find us."" said the bee.

""That's great for me, they'll kill you!"" I screamed as I quickly got a mathematics book to try and squat the bee. The bee immediately flew over it and landed on my shoulder. I screamed again.

""Shhhh!"" said the tiny bee as it buzzed on my ear. It then stung me right on my shoulder and I screamed the loudest this time.

Finally, my mom and dad came knocking on my door. ""Honey, are you okay in there?"" said my mom as she tried to open the door. I heard kicking of the door as I couldn't seem to move at this point. Another kicks later and my dad have finally opened the door.

""Honey? We heard screaming. Where are you?"" said my father.

""I'm right here, there is a bee in here!"" I screamed.

They were not able to hear me. My parents are also not able to see me, until my dad said, ""Hon, there are two bees in here.""

""Shoo, shoo!"" said my mother. ""They've got her, love. They've got her. How did they get in?!""

I was in my room, alone and at first I thought a human intruder has come inside the house. But their voice is too high pitched to be human. It was then I realized, the intruder is a tiny bee. I screamed on the top of my lungs.

""Get away from me, get away from me! I am deathly allergic to bees!"" I screamed.

""But that's the thing, Your Majesty. You are not allergic to us. You're one of us."" said the tiny bee.

""That's.. that's impossible! I'm human, my mother was human so is my sister and my father."" I argued as I looked for anything in the room to squat the tiny little thing.

""You have to be quiet. Your mother and father may come and find us."" said the bee.

""That's great for me, they'll kill you!"" I screamed as I quickly got a mathematics book to try and squat the bee. The bee immediately flew over it and landed on my shoulder. I screamed again.

""Shhhh!"" said the tiny bee as it buzzed on my ear. It then stung me right on my shoulder and I screamed the loudest this time.

Finally, my mom and dad came knocking on my door. ""Honey, are you okay in there?"" said my mom as she tried to open the door. I heard kicking of the door as I couldn't seem to move at this point. Another kicks later and my dad have finally opened the door.

""Honey? We heard screaming. Where are you?"" said my father.

""I'm right here, there is a bee in here!"" I screamed.

They were not able to hear me. My parents are also not able to see me, until my dad said, ""Hon, there are two bees in here.""
