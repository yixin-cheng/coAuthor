They need to work together to end this. 

It takes some time but they finally take down the larger aliens and free the earth from this invasion. But it is not without great cost. Humans are a much smaller population now. Many people like this new power that they share. A movement starts that wants to ban people from having children because it would lesson their power. Without children in the future, the Consciousness would be even stronger. 

This splits the world into two groups, those who want to repopulate and those who do not. These two sides go to war. It causes even more death. The people who do not want to repopulate get the advantage. They then end up wiping out the other group.
