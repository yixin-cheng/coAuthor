""It is,"" he says. You stand there for a moment, then gracefully, but firmly, close the door in his face.

You turn aside in disgust, give up on gardening for the moment, and head back to the house.

Forgetting about that, you go downstairs for breakfast. You're eating a piece of toast when you hear the doorbell ring. You sigh, and put down the toast, and answer the door. It's a man in a black suit. ""Who are you, and what do you want?"" you ask him. ""I'm here to help you pack,"" he says. ""For what? I hope it's not for that ridiculous JFK thing."" ""It is,"" he says. You stand there for a moment, then gracefully, but firmly, close the door in his face.

You sit back down and finish your breakfast, and then turn to doing the dishes, when the doorbell rings again. You grimace, and put down a soapy plate. You head back over to the door, and open it. This time, it's two men in black suits, and they don't look amused. ""Mister Obama, I'm going to have to ask you to come with us."" ""Who are you, where do you want me to go?"" you repeat. ""We're here to take you to meet with JFK,"" says one of the black suited figures. ""Not this again."" you groan, and shut the door once more.

You finish the dishes, then get dressed and go outside. You decide to water the petunias, and just as you've filled up the water can and gotten to work, there's a rustling in the bushes. You separate the foliage with your hands, and look down. It's two more black suited men. One of them looks up at you. ""Please, Mister Obama, you should come with us."" You turn aside in disgust, give up on gardening for the moment, and head back to the house.

You open the door, and are surprised to find that the lights are out. Suddenly, you know a moment of fear. Is it possible this whole thing has been some kidnapping, or assassination plot by right wing nutjobs? You fumble for the switch, and turn on the light.

The light goes on, and you're stunned to see John F. Kennedy, LBJ, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and every other president of the U.S. from the last 60 waiting for you, along with your family, and they've hung up a big sign in the house. It reads ""Happy Birthday!""

Forgetting about that, you go downstairs for breakfast. You're eating a piece of toast when you hear the doorbell ring. You sigh, and put down the toast, and answer the door. It's a man in a black suit. ""Who are you, and what do you want?"" you ask him. ""I'm here to help you pack,"" he says. ""For what? I hope it's not for that ridiculous JFK thing."" ""It is,"" he says. You stand there for a moment, then gracefully, but firmly, close the door in his face.

You sit back down and finish your breakfast, and then turn to doing the dishes, when the doorbell rings again. You grimace, and put down a soapy plate. You head back over to the door, and open it.

""We're here to take you to meet with JFK,"" says one of the black suited figures. ""Not this again."" you groan, and shut the door once more.

You finish the dishes, then get dressed and go outside. You decide to water the petunias, and just as you've filled up the water can and gotten to work, there's a rustling in the bushes. You separate the foliage with your hands, and look down. It's two more black suited men. One of them looks up at you. ""Please, Mister Obama, you should come with us."" You turn aside in disgust, give up on gardening for the moment, and head back to the house.

You open the door, and are surprised to find that the lights are out. Suddenly, you know a moment of fear. Is it possible this whole thing has been some kidnapping, or assassination plot by right wing nutjobs? You fumble for the switch, and turn on the light.

The light goes on, and you're stunned to see John F. Kennedy, LBJ, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and every other president of the U.S. from the last 60 waiting for you, along with your family, and they've hung up a big sign in the house. It reads ""Happy Birthday!""

Forgetting about that, you go downstairs for breakfast. You're eating a piece of toast when you hear the doorbell ring. You sigh, and put down the toast, and answer the door. It's a man in a black suit. ""Who are you, and what do you want?"" you ask him. ""I'm here to help you pack,"" he says. ""For what? I hope it's not for that ridiculous JFK thing."" ""It is,"" he says. You stand there for a moment, then gracefully, but firmly, close the door in his face.

You sit back down and finish your breakfast, and then turn to doing the dishes, when the doorbell rings again. You grimace, and put down a soapy plate. You head back over to the door, and open it. This time, it's two men in black suits, and they don't look amused. ""Mister Obama, I'm going to have to ask you to come with us."" ""Who are you, where do you want me to go?"" you repeat. ""We're here to take you to meet with JFK,"" says one of the black suited figures. ""Not this again."" you groan, and shut the door once more.

You finish the dishes, then get dressed and go outside. You decide to water the petunias, and just as you've filled up the water can and gotten to work, there's a rustling in the bushes. You separate the foliage with your hands, and look down. It's two more black suited men. One of them looks up at you. ""Please, Mister Obama, you should come with us."" You turn aside in disgust, give up on gardening for the moment, and head back to the house.

You open the door, and are surprised to find that the lights are out. Suddenly, you know a moment of fear. Is it possible this whole thing has been some kidnapping, or assassination plot by right wing nutjobs? You fumble for the switch, and turn on the light.

The light goes on, and you're stunned to see John F. Kennedy, LBJ, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and every other president of the U.S. from the last 60 waiting for you, along with your family, and they've hung up a big sign in the house. It reads ""Happy Birthday!""

It's a man in a black suit. ""Who are you, and what do you want?"" you ask him. ""I'm here to help you pack,"" he says. ""For what? I hope it's not for that ridiculous JFK thing."" ""It is,"" he says. You stand there for a moment, then gracefully, but firmly, close the door in his face.

It's a man in a black suit. ""Who are you, and what do you want?"" you ask him. ""I'm here to help you pack,"" he says. ""For what? I hope it's not for that ridiculous JFK thing."" ""It is,"" he says. You stand there for a moment, then gracefully, but firmly, close the door in his face.

You turn aside in disgust, give up on gardening for the moment, and head back to the house.

You open the door, and are surprised to find that the lights are out. Suddenly, you know a moment of fear. Is it possible this whole thing has been some kidnapping, or assassination plot by right wing nutjobs? You fumble for the switch, and turn on the light.

It's a man in a black suit. ""Who are you, and what do you want?"" you ask him. ""I'm here to help you pack,"" he says. ""For what? I hope it's not for that ridiculous JFK thing."" ""It is,"" he says. You stand there for a moment, then gracefully, but firmly, close the door in his face.

You sit back down and finish your breakfast, and then turn to doing the dishes, when the doorbell rings again. You grimace, and put down a soapy plate. You head back over to the door, and open it. This time, it's two men in black suits, and they don't look amused. ""Mister Obama, I'm going to have to ask you to come with us."" ""Who are you, where do you want me to go?"" you repeat. ""We're here to take you to meet with JFK,"" says one of the black suited figures. ""Not this again."" you groan, and shut the door once more.

You finish the dishes, then get dressed and go outside. You decide to water the petunias, and just as you've filled up the water can and gotten to work, there's a rustling in the bushes. You separate the foliage with your hands, and look down. It's two more black suited men. One of them looks up at you. ""Please, Mister Obama, you should come with us.""

You open the door, and are surprised to find that the lights are out. Suddenly, you know a moment of fear. Is it possible this whole thing has been some kidnapping, or assassination plot by right wing nutjobs? You fumble for the switch, and turn on the light.

The light goes on, and you're stunned to see John F. Kennedy, LBJ, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and every other president of the U.S. from the last 60 waiting for you, along with your family, and they've hung up a big sign in the house. It reads ""Happy Birthday!""

You pick up the paper, hesitate for a moment, then crumple it up and throw it in the trash.

Forgetting about that, you go downstairs for breakfast. You're eating a piece of toast when you hear the doorbell ring. You sigh, and put down the toast, and answer the door. It's a man in a black suit. ""Who are you, and what do you want?"" you ask him. ""I'm here to help you pack,"" he says. ""For what? I hope it's not for that ridiculous JFK thing."" ""It is,"" he says. You stand there for a moment, then gracefully, but firmly, close the door in his face.

You sit back down and finish your breakfast, and then turn to doing the dishes, when the doorbell rings again. You grimace, and put down a soapy plate. You head back over to the door, and open it. This time, it's two men in black suits, and they don't look amused. ""Mister Obama, I'm going to have to ask you to come with us."" ""Who are you, where do you want me to go?"" you repeat. ""We're here to take you to meet with JFK,"" says one of the black suited figures. ""Not this again."" you groan, and shut the door once more.

You finish the dishes, then get dressed and go outside. You decide to water the petunias, and just as you've filled up the water can and gotten to work, there's a rustling in the bushes. You separate the foliage with your hands, and look down. It's two more black suited men. One of them looks up at you. ""Please, Mister Obama, you should come with us."" You turn aside in disgust, give up on gardening for the moment, and head back to the house.

You open the door, and are surprised to find that the lights are out. Suddenly, you know a moment of fear. Is it possible this whole thing has been some kidnapping, or assassination plot by right wing nutjobs? You fumble for the switch, and turn on the light.

The light goes on, and you're stunned to see John F. Kennedy, LBJ, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and every other president of the U.S. from the last 60 waiting for you, along with your family, and they've hung up a big sign in the house. It reads ""Happy Birthday!""

It looks like it was written by a first grader. You suspect that it's a prank from Biden, but the handwriting is a little bit too clear. You pick up the paper, hesitate for a moment, then crumple it up and throw it in the trash.

Forgetting about that, you go downstairs for breakfast. You're eating a piece of toast when you hear the doorbell ring. You sigh, and put down the toast, and answer the door. It's a man in a black suit. ""Who are you, and what do you want?"" you ask him. ""I'm here to help you pack,"" he says. ""For what? I hope it's not for that ridiculous JFK thing."" ""It is,"" he says. You stand there for a moment, then gracefully, but firmly, close the door in his face.

You sit back down and finish your breakfast, and then turn to doing the dishes, when the doorbell rings again. You grimace, and put down a soapy plate. You head back over to the door, and open it.

You finish the dishes, then get dressed and go outside. You decide to water the petunias, and just as you've filled up the water can and gotten to work, there's a rustling in the bushes. You separate the foliage with your hands, and look down. It's two more black suited men. One of them looks up at you. ""Please, Mister Obama, you should come with us."" You turn aside in disgust, give up on gardening for the moment, and head back to the house.

You open the door, and are surprised to find that the lights are out. Suddenly, you know a moment of fear. Is it possible this whole thing has been some kidnapping, or assassination plot by right wing nutjobs? You fumble for the switch, and turn on the light.

You turn aside in disgust, give up on gardening for the moment, and head back to the house.

You open the door, and are surprised to find that the lights are out. Suddenly, you know a moment of fear. Is it possible this whole thing has been some kidnapping, or assassination plot by right wing nutjobs? You fumble for the switch, and turn on the light.

The light goes on, and you're stunned to see John F. Kennedy, LBJ, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and every other president of the U.S. from the last 60 waiting for you, along with your family, and they've hung up a big sign in the house. It reads ""Happy Birthday!""

""It is,"" he says. You stand there for a moment, then gracefully, but firmly, close the door in his face.
