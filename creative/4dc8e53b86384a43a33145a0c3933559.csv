 After about 5 mins another single bee flew into my room and lands on my shoulder. Sire, the kingdom is being attacked by hornets, we need you to come back and take your rightful place as our king and help defend our hive. I was very confused. The one thing I knew for certain was that the bees did not intend to sting me but only wanted my help which I did not know how to give. I ran to my mother again and told her what happened. This time she sat me down and told me about my past. I was once the proud ruler of billions of bees. I was the king to every queen of every hive in the known land. Then the day came where my life was in danger from within. There was a plot by the military ants to kill me and take over the kingdom. So they used an expirimental technology on me that transfered my consciousness into a being that can process all the information a bee is able to in its small but very compact brain. So they put me into this young boy with my parents permission. They knew their son would be fine and they also knew how important it was for me to hide in this way.

Sire, the kingdom is being attacked by hornets, we need you to come back and take your rightful place as our king and help defend our hive. I was very confused. The one thing I knew for certain was that the bees did not intend to sting me but only wanted my help which I did not know how to give. I ran to my mother again and told her what happened. This time she sat me down and told me about my past. I was once the proud ruler of billions of bees. I was the king to every queen of every hive in the known land. Then the day came where my life was in danger from within. There was a plot by the military ants to kill me and take over the kingdom. So they used an expirimental technology on me that transfered my consciousness into a being that can process all the information a bee is able to in its small but very compact brain.

Sire, the kingdom is being attacked by hornets, we need you to come back and take your rightful place as our king and help defend our hive. I was very confused. The one thing I knew for certain was that the bees did not intend to sting me but only wanted my help which I did not know how to give. I ran to my mother again and told her what happened. This time she sat me down and told me about my past. I was once the proud ruler of billions of bees. I was the king to every queen of every hive in the known land. Then the day came where my life was in danger from within. There was a plot by the military ants to kill me and take over the kingdom. So they used an expirimental technology on me that transfered my consciousness into a being that can process all the information a bee is able to in its small but very compact brain. So they put me into this young boy with my parents permission. They knew their son would be fine and they also knew how important it was for me to hide in this way.

I wonder if it will happen again if I were to open the window a little wider? 
I opened the window and waited.
 After about 5 mins another single bee flew into my room and lands on my shoulder. Sire, the kingdom is being attacked by hornets, we need you to come back and take your rightful place as our king and help defend our hive. I was very confused. The one thing I knew for certain was that the bees did not intend to sting me but only wanted my help which I did not know how to give. I ran to my mother again and told her what happened. This time she sat me down and told me about my past. I was once the proud ruler of billions of bees. I was the king to every queen of every hive in the known land. Then the day came where my life was in danger from within. There was a plot by the military ants to kill me and take over the kingdom. So they used an expirimental technology on me that transfered my consciousness into a being that can process all the information a bee is able to in its small but very compact brain. So they put me into this young boy with my parents permission. They knew their son would be fine and they also knew how important it was for me to hide in this way.

This time she sat me down and told me about my past. I was once the proud ruler of billions of bees. I was the king to every queen of every hive in the known land. Then the day came where my life was in danger from within. There was a plot by the military ants to kill me and take over the kingdom. So they used an expirimental technology on me that transfered my consciousness into a being that can process all the information a bee is able to in its small but very compact brain. So they put me into this young boy with my parents permission. They knew their son would be fine and they also knew how important it was for me to hide in this way.

I wonder if it will happen again if I were to open the window a little wider? 
I opened the window and waited.
 After about 5 mins another single bee flew into my room and lands on my shoulder. Sire, the kingdom is being attacked by hornets, we need you to come back and take your rightful place as our king and help defend our hive. I was very confused. The one thing I knew for certain was that the bees did not intend to sting me but only wanted my help which I did not know how to give. I ran to my mother again and told her what happened. This time she sat me down and told me about my past. I was once the proud ruler of billions of bees. I was the king to every queen of every hive in the known land. Then the day came where my life was in danger from within. There was a plot by the military ants to kill me and take over the kingdom. So they used an expirimental technology on me that transfered my consciousness into a being that can process all the information a bee is able to in its small but very compact brain. So they put me into this young boy with my parents permission. They knew their son would be fine and they also knew how important it was for me to hide in this way.

The one thing I knew for certain was that the bees did not intend to sting me but only wanted my help which I did not know how to give. I ran to my mother again and told her what happened. This time she sat me down and told me about my past. I was once the proud ruler of billions of bees. I was the king to every queen of every hive in the known land. Then the day came where my life was in danger from within. There was a plot by the military ants to kill me and take over the kingdom. So they used an expirimental technology on me that transfered my consciousness into a being that can process all the information a bee is able to in its small but very compact brain. So they put me into this young boy with my parents permission. They knew their son would be fine and they also knew how important it was for me to hide in this way. 

The day finally came where the bee scientists came to my room, connected a device behind my ear and transfered my consciousness into a finely dressed bee that was laying besides me. After the transfer, the king bee rose and flew off with his followers and mounted a resistance that was never riveled again to beat off the hornet invasion that threatened the bee king's kingdom.

Sire, the kingdom is being attacked by hornets, we need you to come back and take your rightful place as our king and help defend our hive. I was very confused. The one thing I knew for certain was that the bees did not intend to sting me but only wanted my help which I did not know how to give. I ran to my mother again and told her what happened. This time she sat me down and told me about my past. I was once the proud ruler of billions of bees. I was the king to every queen of every hive in the known land. Then the day came where my life was in danger from within. There was a plot by the military ants to kill me and take over the kingdom. So they used an experimental technology on me that transferred my consciousness into a being that can process all the information a bee is able to in its small but very compact brain. So they put me into this young boy with my parents permission. They knew their son would be fine and they also knew how important it was for me to hide in this way. 

The day finally came where the bee scientists came to my room, connected a device behind my ear and transferred my consciousness into a finely dressed bee that was laying besides me. After the transfer, the king bee rose and flew off with his followers and mounted a resistance that was never riagain to beat off the hornet invasion that threatened the bee king's kingdom.

Sire, the kingdom is being attacked by hornets, we need you to come back and take your rightful place as our king and help defend our hive. I was very confused. The one thing I knew for certain was that the bees did not intend to sting me but only wanted my help which I did not know how to give. I ran to my mother again and told her what happened. This time she sat me down and told me about my past. I was once the proud ruler of billions of bees. I was the king to every queen of every hive in the known land. Then the day came where my life was in danger from within. There was a plot by the military ants to kill me and take over the kingdom. So they used an experimental technology on me that transferred my consciousness into a being that can process all the information a bee is able to in its small but very compact brain. So they put me into this young boy with my parents permission. They knew their son would be fine and they also knew how important it was for me to hide in this way. 

The day finally came where the bee scientists came to my room, connected a device behind my ear and transferred my consciousness into a finely dressed bee that was laying besides me. After the transfer, the king bee rose and flew off with his followers and mounted a resistance that was never riveled again to beat off the hornet invasion that threatened the bee king's kingdom.

I wonder if it will happen again if I were to open the window a little wider? 
I opened the window and waited.
 After about 5 mins another single bee flew into my room and lands on my shoulder. Sire, the kingdom is being attacked by hornets, we need you to come back and take your rightful place as our king and help defend our hive. I was very confused. The one thing I knew for certain was that the bees did not intend to sting me but only wanted my help which I did not know how to give. I ran to my mother again and told her what happened. This time she sat me down and told me about my past. I was once the proud ruler of billions of bees. I was the king to every queen of every hive in the known land. Then the day came where my life was in danger from within. There was a plot by the military ants to kill me and take over the kingdom. So they used an experimental technology on me that transferred my consciousness into a being that can process all the information a bee is able to in its small but very compact brain. So they put me into this young boy with my parents permission. They knew their son would be fine and they also knew how important it was for me to hide in this way. 

The day finally came where the bee scientists came to my room, connected a device behind my ear and transferred my consciousness into a finely dressed bee that was laying besides me. After the transfer, the king bee rose and flew off with his followers and mounted an unparrelled resistance that was never riveled again to beat off the hornet invasion that threatened the bee king's kingdom.
