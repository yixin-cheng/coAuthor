You raise your arms.  You find that they have transformed into a pair of large, membranous wings. You look at your body, and see that you has become a large, fuzzy bee. The bee darts out the window, and you chase after it.

You fly over the treetops, and see a group of men in a clearing, surrounding a large, wooden box. You don't see any way that just you two can overpower these men. ""What should we do?"" you ask the bee. ""We need to get more bees."" it responds. ""How do we do that?"" you ask. ""Just call to them. As their Princess, they will follow you."" You begin to buzz, and before long , a large swarm of bees has gathered. You hesitate for an instant, then you lead them towards the clearing. You, and your swarm, descend on the men, stinging them and chasing them away. Many workers die as they lose their stingers, but as a young Queen, you are able to sting repeatedly, and your stings are decisive.
