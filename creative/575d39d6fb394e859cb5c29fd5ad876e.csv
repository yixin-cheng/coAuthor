They have mandated that all persons be married, and they are required to have 10 children in each family.  The state decides whom will be married to whom. This has resulted into a juggernaut. They are basically unstoppable.

The rest of the world, save the US, have all banded together to fight them. Alas, they seem unstoppable. With so many strong young people available to feed into their military, nothing seems to stop them. They are also leading in technology, right now they are involved in advancing on the former Country called Russia. Some other nations are supporting them, to help check the Asian Pan Chinese.  The harsh plains of Siberia is the location, presently of the conflict. USA is at a loss. Persons in the newly unexiled country are wondering where they fit in. The new tech wielded by Pan China is boggling and there seems no stopping them. The US president, Arnold Swartzenegger seems full of bluster, but the tech and manpower needed to match seem futile.
