As the story begins, a young man named Watashi is living a boring life in the provincial town of Kunimi.

Watashi is bored by his everyday existance and feels as though he is not challenged. He desperately wants more out of life. One day, a mysterious girl named Himari appears in his monotonous life and offers him an opportunity to change. Watashi is intrigued by the offerings of Himari and he wants to learn more about how she can enhance his life and fulfill his desires. Watashi asks Himari how she can change his life.

Himari teases Watashi and tells him if he will believe her, she will give a demonstration of her magical powers. Watashi is curious and accepts Himari's offer and decides to believe in her. Himari tells Watashi that she will give him the ability to be able to use magic. Watashi thinks that this is a wonderful thing and he is excited to gain the powers to perform magic and grant himself his greatest desires as a result.
