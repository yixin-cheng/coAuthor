The orphan pig ran away from home, far away from the clutches of their parent's murderer. They eventually found themselves in a small village, where they were taken in by a family of pigs. They sympathized with little pig and the loss of their parents, realizing they were truly all alone in the world. The pig although saddened, soon came to accept their new parents, and found themselves a part of the community in due time. The pig was taught the ways of the village, and was taught to raise crops and mill them for food. The pig was happy, and lived a good life with the family.

The pig then vowed to avenge their parents, and find the person who did this to them. Taking the jewelry and his family heirlooms, he left the village and never returned.

They continued investigating the chest, and eventually came across a photo. The photo was of a family of pigs, two parents and their child.

 They were amazed at all the sights and sounds they saw on their adventure. They eventually came across a destroyed village, without any current living residents. The pig was curious, and decided to investigate. Looking amongst the rubble, they discovered a particular hut, that was in better condition than the other houses that were destroyed. The pig entered the hut, and found a small chest. In the chest they found a variety of items, including family heirlooms and jewelry. They continued investigating the chest, and eventually came across a photo. The photo was of a family of pigs, two parents and their child. The pig realized it was their parents, and they were in their old home. They began to cry, and felt awful when they remembered that they were murdered along with the rest of the village. The pig then vowed to avenge their parents, and find the person who did this to them. Taking the jewelry and his family heirlooms, he left the village and never returned. His journey would take much longer than he initially expected, for he still had one goal that needed to be done before he returned back to his village.

The orphan pig ran away from home, far away from the clutches of their parent's murderer. They eventually found themselves in a small village, where they were taken in by a family of pigs. They sympathized with little pig and the loss of their parents, realizing they were truly all alone in the world. The pig although saddened, soon came to accept their new parents, and found themselves a part of the community in due time. The pig was taught the ways of the village, and was taught to raise crops and mill them for food. The pig was happy, and lived a good life with the family.

The pig realized it was their parents, and they were in their old home. They began to cry, and felt awful when they remembered that they were murdered along with the rest of the village. The pig then vowed to avenge their parents, and find the person who did this to them. Taking the jewelry and his family heirlooms, he left the village and never returned. His journey would take much longer than he initially expected, for he still had one goal that needed to be done before he returned back to his village.
