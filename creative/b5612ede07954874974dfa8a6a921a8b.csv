Like for example, after World War I and II we have worked so hard to make sure that the same mistakes are not made again. Diplomacy and negotiation is much more valuable than the bloodshed and consequences from something as serious as a World War.

I think the advancement of technology has also caused many to be more connected with one another, but in a different way. My father has family in Italy.

I think another reason why the world has changed is simply because over the last 50 years tons of mistakes have happened and we have learned from them. Like for example, after World War I and II we have worked so hard to make sure that the same mistakes are not made again.

SThink about children for example. Back in the day, children would have to go out and play with their friends in order to have fun. Now children are glued to their phones playing games and apps and not getting the in person socialization that us parents got as kids. 

I think the advancement of technology has also caused many to be more connected with one another, but in a different way. My father has family in Italy. He is able to communicate them because of these technological advancements. He can use Face Time so he can see his family rather than just a phone call where he can only hear them. 

I think another reason why the world has changed is simply because over the last 50 years tons of mistakes have happened and we have learned from them. Like for example, after World War I and II we have worked so hard to make sure that the same mistakes are not made again. Diplomacy and negotiation is much more valuable than the bloodshed and consequences from something as serious as a World War. 
I personally think that technology has truly changed our world in a positive manner and I can't imagine what life would be like without all of

SThink about children for example. Back in the day, children would have to go out and play with their friends in order to have fun. Now children are glued to their phones playing games and apps and not getting the in person socialization that us parents got as kids. 

I think the advancement of technology has also caused many to be more connected with one another, but in a different way. My father has family in Italy. He is able to communicate them because of these technological advancements. He can use Face Time so he can see his family rather than just a phone call where he can only hear them. 

I think another reason why the world has changed is simply because over the last 50 years tons of mistakes have happened and we have learned from them. Like for example, after World War I and II we have worked so hard to make sure that the same mistakes are not made again. Diplomacy and negotiation is much more valuable than the bloodshed and consequences from something as serious as a World War. 
I personally think that technology has truly changed our world in a positive manner and I can't imagine what life would be like without all of
 these devices at our fingertips. Of course there are some negative aspects of technology as well, but overall it has bettered out world.

I think another reason why the world has changed is simply because over the last 50 years tons of mistakes have happened and we have learned from them.

I think the advancement of technology has also caused many to be more connected with one another, but in a different way. My father has family in Italy.

Diplomacy and negotiation is much more valuable than the bloodshed and consequences from something as serious as a World War.

 I think the advancement of technology has played a major role in that. Technology has changed the way we get information, the way we communicate and overall how we live our daily lives. 
SThink about children for example. Back in the day, children would have to go out and play with their friends in order to have fun. Now children are glued to their phones playing games and apps and not getting the in person socialization that us parents got as kids. 

I think the advancement of technology has also caused many to be more connected with one another, but in a different way. My father has family in Italy. He is able to communicate them because of these technological advancements. He can use Face Time so he can see his family rather than just a phone call where he can only hear them. 

I think another reason why the world has changed is simply because over the last 50 years tons of mistakes have happened and we have learned from them. Like for example, after World War I and II we have worked so hard to make sure that the same mistakes are not made again. Diplomacy and negotiation is much more valuable than the bloodshed and consequences from something as serious as a World War.

SThink about children for example. Back in the day, children would have to go out and play with their friends in order to have fun. Now children are glued to their phones playing games and apps and not getting the in person socialization that us parents got as kids. 

I think the advancement of technology has also caused many to be more connected with one another, but in a different way. My father has family in Italy. He is able to communicate them because of these technological advancements. He can use Face Time so he can see his family rather than just a phone call where he can only hear them. 

I think another reason why the world has changed is simply because over the last 50 years tons of mistakes have happened and we have learned from them. Like for example, after World War I and II we have worked so hard to make sure that the same mistakes are not made again. Diplomacy and negotiation is much more valuable than the bloodshed and consequences from something as serious as a World War. 
I personally think that technology has truly changed our world in a positive manner and I can't imagine what life would be like without all of
 these devices at our fingertips. Of course there are some negative aspects of technology as well, but overall it has bettered out world. 

Think about all of the information that we have at our fingertips. Think about GPS. Think about Face Time. Messaging apps. Yelp. DuoLingo. Think about all of these things that we use on a daily basis.

I think another reason why the world has changed is simply because over the last 50 years tons of mistakes have happened and we have learned from them.

The world has changed drastically in the last 50 years, and the real question remains: Why?
 I think the advancement of technology has played a major role in that. Technology has changed the way we get information, the way we communicate and overall how we live our daily lives. 
SThink about children for example. Back in the day, children would have to go out and play with their friends in order to have fun. Now children are glued to their phones playing games and apps and not getting the in person socialization that us parents got as kids. 

I think the advancement of technology has also caused many to be more connected with one another, but in a different way. My father has family in Italy. He is able to communicate them because of these technological advancements. He can use Face Time so he can see his family rather than just a phone call where he can only hear them. 

I think another reason why the world has changed is simply because over the last 50 years tons of mistakes have happened and we have learned from them. Like for example, after World War I and II we have worked so hard to make sure that the same mistakes are not made again. Diplomacy and negotiation is much more valuable than the bloodshed and consequences from something as serious as a World War.

I think the advancement of technology has also caused many to be more connected with one another, but in a different way. My father has family in Italy. He is able to communicate them because of these technological advancements. He can use Face Time so he can see his family rather than just a phone call where he can only hear them. 

I think another reason why the world has changed is simply because over the last 50 years tons of mistakes have happened and we have learned from them. Like for example, after World War I and II we have worked so hard to make sure that the same mistakes are not made again.

I think another reason why the world has changed is simply because over the last 50 years tons of mistakes have happened and we have learned from them. Like for example, after World War I and II we have worked so hard to make sure that the same mistakes are not made again.
