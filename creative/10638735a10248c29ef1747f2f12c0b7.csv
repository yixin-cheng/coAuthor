You watch as you finish high school, go to college, and get your first real job.   ou watch as you fall in love again, and get married.
 At this point, you begin to get a little nervous about where this story is going. You stand up and walk to the back of the theatre, looking for an usher, checking to see if maybe there's a concession stand out front.  You find a door marked 'EXIT', and you push it open.  You get a bad feeling about this, and decide to return to the theater for now, but you still have a craving for popcorn or even cheese nachos.  You return to your seat, and continue watching the film. You watch as your marriage falls apart from the same poor choices, and continue watching as you go through the same experiences again and again, and you begin to wonder if you are really making any progress.  You watch your second marriage. You watch as you have children, and then watch as you lose them, whether to estrangement from the divorce, or untimely deaths, or just the ordinary process of them growing up and moving out to lead their own lives.  You watch as you get older, and begin to feel your mortality, and become increasingly weak and infirm.
