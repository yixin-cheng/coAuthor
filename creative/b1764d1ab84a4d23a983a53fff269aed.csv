 ""Reeeeeeeee!"" Squealed the alien upon the arrival of fifteen girls clad in crop tops and high-waisted jean shorts.

""Matt Damon!"" Shouted a man that was restrained by chains. 

""Oh my god, the alien probed him!"" One girl shouted.

""That's hot!"" Another added. I'm going to have his babies!""



The girls surrounded the alien, and their faces were filled with terror.
 They couldn't believe what they were seeing. This was their idol, their hero. Matt Damon is a legend, and they had never witnessed him in such a vulnerable position.
""Let him go!""
 Kara shouted.

The largest girl in the group ran towards the alien and jumped on top of it, crushing the life out of it in an instant with her large mass. The alien struggled to breathe, but it was futile. The weight of the girl was too much for it. The alien was dead and the human girls began their celebration.
