The woman is surprised and relieved that the man's personality hasn't changed at all since they broke up. She thought she had ruined everything but was beginning to think he was the one.

Months go by and the couple are getting closer and closer when the man finally admits to her that he is a shapeshifter. She has actually been dating him over and over for months. He had so much interest in her he couldn't let her go and had to find out what type of man she was interested in. The woman is taken back by the revelation and informs him that she's going to go stay with her grandmother for a while to think everything over. She speaks to her grandmother and tells her she can't trust the man because he tricked her. The grandmother explains that while that may be true, she should really think about how much effort he put in to please her.

The woman is surprised and relieved that the man's personality hasn't changed at all since they broke up. She thought she had ruined everything but was beginning to think he was the one.

Months go by and the couple are getting closer and closer when the man finally admits to her that he is a shapeshifter. She has actually been dating him over and over for months. He had so much interest in her he couldn't let her go and had to find out what type of man she was interested in. The woman is taken back by the revelation and informs him that she's going to go stay with her grandmother for a while to think everything over. She speaks to her grandmother and tells her she can't trust the man because he tricked her. The grandmother explains that while that may be true, she should really think about how much effort he put in to please her.

The woman is surprised and relieved that the man's personality hasn't changed at all since they broke up. She thought she had ruined everything but was beginning to think he was the one.

Months go by and the couple are getting closer and closer when the man finally admits to her that he is a shapeshifter. She has actually been dating him over and over for months. He had so much interest in her he couldn't let her go and had to find out what type of man she was interested in. The woman is taken back by the revelation and informs him that she's going to go stay with her grandmother for a while to think everything over. She speaks to her grandmother and tells her she can't trust the man because he tricked her. The grandmother explains that while that may be true, she should really think about how much effort he put in to please her.

A few more weeks go by and the woman makes up her mind. She wants to give the two of them another try, but she doesn't want to be deceived again. She tells the man that he is to come of his normal form and they will go on a date. The man agrees, respects her wishes and transforms into himself right in front of her.

She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.

One day, she meets a guy who’s different from all the others: he's polite, handsome and very charming. She begins dating him, and everything is going well. She's about to tell him how she feels, but suddenly a terrible thought occurs to her and she pushes him away. The man gives her space but about two weeks later runs into her at a coffee shop. They make small talk and the woman starts to realize she made a mistake. Luckily for her, she receives a text on her phone from the man telling her how much he misses her and how he'd like to give it a go again. She tells him she'd like to give it a go again as well.

The two have a date at a carnival. The two of them are having a great time eating fried oreos and playing games. The man even won her a giant oversized stuffed teddy bear by playing darts.

He had so much interest in her he couldn't let her go and had to find out what type of man she was interested in. The woman is taken back by the revelation and informs him that she's going to go stay with her grandmother for a while to think everything over. She speaks to her grandmother and tells her she can't trust the man because he tricked her. The grandmother explains that while that may be true, she should really think about how much effort he put in to please her.

A few more weeks go by and the woman makes up her mind. She wants to give the two of them another try, but she doesn't want to be deceived again.

One day, she meets a guy who’s different from all the others: he's polite, handsome and very charming. She begins dating him, and everything is going well. She's about to tell him how she feels, but suddenly a terrible thought occurs to her and she pushes him away. The man gives her space but about two weeks later runs into her at a coffee shop.

One day, she meets a guy who’s different from all the others: he's polite, handsome and very charming. She begins dating him, and everything is going well. She's about to tell him how she feels, but suddenly a terrible thought occurs to her and she pushes him away. The man gives her space but about two weeks later runs into her at a coffee shop. They make small talk and the woman starts to realize she made a mistake. Luckily for her, she receives a text on her phone from the man telling her how much he misses her and how he'd like to give it a go again. She tells him she'd like to give it a go again as well.

The two have a date at a carnival. The two of them are having a great time eating fried oreos and playing games. The man even won her a giant oversized stuffed teddy bear by playing darts.

One day, she meets a guy who’s different from all the others: he's polite, handsome and very charming. She begins dating him, and everything is going well. She's about to tell him how she feels, but suddenly a terrible thought occurs to her and she pushes him away. The man gives her space but about two weeks later runs into her at a coffee shop.

Months go by and the couple are getting closer and closer when the man finally admits to her that he is a shapeshifter. She has actually been dating him over and over for months. He had so much interest in her he couldn't let her go and had to find out what type of man she was interested in. The woman is taken back by the revelation and informs him that she's going to go stay with her grandmother for a while to think everything over. She speaks to her grandmother and tells her she can't trust the man because he tricked her. The grandmother explains that while that may be true, she should really think about how much effort he put in to please her.

A few more weeks go by and the woman makes up her mind. She wants to give the two of them another try, but she doesn't want to be deceived again. She tells the man that he is to come of his normal form and they will go on a date. The man agrees, respects her wishes and transforms into himself right in front of her.

The two go on another date and find they have a lot more in common than they previously had thought. The woman asks the man why he tricked her and he explained that he had confidence issues and didn't think she'd give him the time of day. He told her he was trying to find out what kind of guy she was looking for and found that he wasn't that person. However, the woman agreed to go on a second date with the real man. And a third. And a fourth. They got so close that in the end they got married and had two children. It was a fairytale of sorts with a beautiful ending and one that nobody expected. Not the shapeshifter, nor the woman. Fate is funny sometimes.",2739,[],0,3,5,30,0.75,1,0,1,2116
