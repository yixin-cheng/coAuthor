I thought this was strange since I'm deathly allergic to bee but I was happy to be queen so I played along.The bee then said ""Your first order is to go to the meadow and make a hive.""
 I didn't know how to make a hive the way bees do, but I did the best I could.  got asomestick sand leafvesand I made a lhive that looked just like a little house for the bees. ""How's that?"" I asked the bee when I was finished.I heard the bee say ""It's very nice, but you forgot the most important thing.""
 
""And what's that?"" I asked. And the bee said I need to put it up high in a tree so nothing can harm it. So I climbed a tree and I carefully tied my handcrafted beehive house up in the top of a tree. There, it's safe now.,
 I said to the bee.

 I didn't know how to make a hive the way bees do, but I did the best I could.  got asomestick sand leafvesand I made a lhive that looked just like a little house for the bees. ""How's that?"" I asked the bee when I was finished.I heard the bee say ""It's very nice, but you forgot the most important thing.""
 
""And what's that?"" I asked. And the bee said I need to put it up high in a tree so nothing can harm it. So I climbed a tree and I carefully tied my handcrafted beehive house up in the top of a tree. There, it's safe now.,

The next day, I could see hundreds of bees moving into the hive. ""They won't sting me will they?"" I asked my new friend. ""No, you are the queen and they will do anything for you,"" the bee replied.
 And then I had a great idea.

I thought this was strange since I'm deathly allergic to bee but I was happy to be queen so I played along.The bee then said ""Your first order is to go to the meadow and make a hive.""
 I didn't know how to make a hive the way bees do, but I did the best I could.  got asomestick sand leafvesand I made a lhive that looked just like a little house for the bees. ""How's that?"" I asked the bee when I was finished.I heard the bee say ""It's very nice, but you forgot the most important thing.""
 
""And what's that?"" I asked. And the bee said I need to put it up high in a tree so nothing can harm it. So I climbed a tree and I carefully tied my handcrafted beehive house up in the top of a tree. There, it's safe now.,
 I said to the bee.

I thought this was strange since I'm deathly allergic to bee but I was happy to be queen so I played along.The bee then said ""Your first order is to go to the meadow and make a hive.""
 I didn't know how to make a hive the way bees do, but I did the best I could.  got asomestick sand leafvesand I made a lhive that looked just like a little house for the bees. ""How's that?"" I asked the bee when I was finished.I heard the bee say ""It's very nice, but you forgot the most important thing.""
 
""And what's that?"" I asked. And the bee said I need to put it up high in a tree so nothing can harm it. So I climbed a tree and I carefully tied my handcrafted beehive house up in the top of a tree. There, it's safe now.,
 I said to the bee.
The next day, I could see hundreds of bees moving into the hive. ""They won't sting me will they?"" I asked my new friend. ""No, you are the queen and they will do anything for you,"" the bee replied.

I am very surprised to hear a bee talk, but nevertheless I asked the bee ""What do you mean?""
he bee replied ""You are the queen of the bees, and he bees have chosen you to rule over them.
""
I thought this was strange since I'm deathly allergic to bee but I was happy to be queen so I played along.The bee then said ""Your first order is to go to the meadow and make a hive.""
 I didn't know how to make a hive the way bees do, but I did the best I could.  got asomestick sand leafvesand I made a lhive that looked just like a little house for the bees. ""How's that?"" I asked the bee when I was finished.I heard the bee say ""It's very nice, but you forgot the most important thing.""
 
""And what's that?"" I asked. And the bee said I need to put it up high in a tree so nothing can harm it. So I climbed a tree and I carefully tied my handcrafted beehive house up in the top of a tree. There, it's safe now.,
 I said to the bee.
The next day, I could see hundreds of bees moving into the hive. ""They won't sting me will they?"" I asked my new friend. ""No, you are the queen and they will do anything for you,"" the bee replied.
 And then I had a great idea. 
""Little bee I have a favor to ask of you,"" I told my friend. 
""What is that?"" asked the friendly bee.
""I am so allergic to a bee sting. I am willing to be your queen and I will even stay and guard the hive if you do me this one thing. Can you make me not allergic to bee stings?""

I thought this was strange since I'm deathly allergic to bee but I was happy to be queen so I played along.The bee then said ""Your first order is to go to the meadow and make a hive.""
 I didn't know how to make a hive the way bees do, but I did the best I could.  got asomestick sand leafvesand I made a lhive that looked just like a little house for the bees. ""How's that?"" I asked the bee when I was finished.I heard the bee say ""It's very nice, but you forgot the most important thing.""
 
""And what's that?"" I asked. And the bee said I need to put it up high in a tree so nothing can harm it. So I climbed a tree and I carefully tied my handcrafted beehive house up in the top of a tree. There, it's safe now.,
 I said to the bee.
The next day, I could see hundreds of bees moving into the hive. ""They won't sting me will they?"" I asked my new friend. ""No, you are the queen and they will do anything for you,"" the bee replied.

 I didn't know how to make a hive the way bees do, but I did the best I could.  got asomestick sand leafvesand I made a lhive that looked just like a little house for the bees. ""How's that?"" I asked the bee when I was finished.I heard the bee say ""It's very nice, but you forgot the most important thing.""
 
""And what's that?"" I asked. And the bee said I need to put it up high in a tree so nothing can harm it. So I climbed a tree and I carefully tied my handcrafted beehive house up in the top of a tree. There, it's safe now.,
 I said to the bee.
The next day, I could see hundreds of bees moving into the hive. ""They won't sting me will they?"" I asked my new friend. ""No, you are the queen and they will do anything for you,"" the bee replied.
 And then I had a great idea. 
""Little bee I have a favor to ask of you,"" I told my friend. 
""What is that?"" asked the friendly bee.
""I am so allergic to a bee sting. I am willing to be your queen and I will even stay and guard the hive if you do me this one thing. Can you make me not allergic to bee stings?""
""I don't think I have the power,"" said the bee. ""But I can travel far and wide and tell all of the bees that you are my queen and that they can never sting you.""
""That would be great!"", I exclaimed.  So a great deal was worked out. I kept the bees safe from harm and I was protected from being stung by bees again for the rest of my life. The",2045,[],1,1,5,30,0.3,1,0,0,1656
