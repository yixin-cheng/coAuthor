You ask who it is, and they introduce themselves as William. You see one of your secret service people standing outside your room. You ask William to hold on a second, and they agree.

You ask your secret service member if they saw anything in the night, anything strange. They tell you no. So you return to the call with William. He tells you that you need to get to the airport immediately. You agree, but also ask how they got the letter into your room while you were sleeping, and how they got past the guards. William tells you that you will find out soon, and that you need to get to the airport.

When you arrive at the airport, you are greeted by a man in a black suit. He says come with me please sir. You follow him, and he leads you to a private jet. On board he explains that you are going to be meeting with some of the most powerful people in the world. They all have names of old world leaders like JFK, and FDR.

At the meeting you are greeted by the group. They explain that they are the Illuminati, and they have been pulling the strings forever. They want you to join them.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

You are really confused about this letter, and still groggy from your sleep, you question who could have been signing their name as JFK. Even more so you wonder how they got into your room while you where sleeping. You decide to call the number and you are greeted by a voice that sounds like it belongs to a young man. You ask who it is, and they introduce themselves as William. You see one of your secret service people standing outside your room. You ask William to hold on a second, and they agree.

You ask your secret service member if they saw anything in the night, anything strange. They tell you no. So you return to the call with William. He tells you that you need to get to the airport immediately. You agree, but also ask how they got the letter into your room while you were sleeping, and how they got past the guards. William tells you that you will find out soon, and that you need to get to the airport.

When you arrive at the airport, you are greeted by a man in a black suit. He says come with me please sir. You follow him, and he leads you to a private jet. On board he explains that you are going to be meeting with some of the most powerful people in the world. They all have names of old world leaders like JFK, and FDR.

At the meeting you are greeted by the group. They explain that they are the Illuminati, and they have been pulling the strings forever. They want you to join them. They explain that they have been in control of the government since the beginning, and that they have been in control of the world for a long time. They say they want you to join them.
