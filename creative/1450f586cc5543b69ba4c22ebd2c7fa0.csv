 certified indestructible.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""
The wolf found the house of depleted uranium and was like, ""this is hard to bite."" I don't know if I'm gonna be able to blow this down or not."" 
But the wolf decided to try.
 So he blew and blew, and blew and blew as hard as he could, but the house of depleted uranium didn't fall down. ""You're not going to get to me!"", said the Pig. 
""I guess I'll just have to come back tomorrow and try again,"" said the wolf.
 
And so the wolf went home and waited for the next day, but the 92nd little pig wasn't worried at all because his house was
 certified indestructible. 
But then the wolf thought of something.
 ""Hey, I know another way to get into this house,"" he said. ""I'll just figure out a way to break in when the Pig is asleep,"" he thought. 
So the wolf came back that night when the Pig was asleep.
 He came through the chimney, and he sneaked over to the Pig's bedroom. And he looked at the Pig sleeping, and he had an idea. ""If I can just reach that Pig, I might be able to gobble him up."" he thought. So he went over to the Pig and tried to take a bite of his arm. ""This is rubber!"" he exclaimed. The Pig had put a dummy pig in his place so he could trick the Wolf. 
""This Pig is one smart fellow,"" thought the Wolf.
 ""He's outwitted me again."" So he went back outside and slept on the front porch. The next morning, the Pig woke him up and said, ""Get outta here!""

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""
The wolf found the house of depleted uranium and was like, ""this is hard to bite."" I don't know if I'm gonna be able to blow this down or not.""

The Pig had put a dummy pig in his place so he could trick the Wolf. 
""This Pig is one smart fellow,"" thought the Wolf.
 ""He's outwitted me again."" So he went back outside and slept on the front porch. The next morning, the Pig woke him up and said, ""Get outta here!"" 
And the Wolf was like, ""I don't get this.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""
The wolf found the house of depleted uranium and was like, ""this is hard to bite."" I don't know if I'm gonna be able to blow this down or not."" 
But the wolf decided to try.
 So he blew and blew, and blew and blew as hard as he could, but the house of depleted uranium didn't fall down. ""You're not going to get to me!"", said the Pig. 
""I guess I'll just have to come back tomorrow and try again,"" said the wolf.
 
And so the wolf went home and waited for the next day, but the 92nd little pig wasn't worried at all because his house was
 certified indestructible. 
But then the wolf thought of something.
 ""Hey, I know another way to get into this house,"" he said. ""I'll just figure out a way to break in when the Pig is asleep,"" he thought. 
So the wolf came back that night when the Pig was asleep.
 He came through the chimney, and he sneaked over to the Pig's bedroom. And he looked at the Pig sleeping, and he had an idea. ""If I can just reach that Pig, I might be able to gobble him up."" he thought. So he went over to the Pig and tried to take a bite of his arm. ""This is rubber!"" he exclaimed.
