You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand. Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" You think on that, as though asking yourself to instruct yourself... You're not really afraid of bees, but the allergy thing is dangerous. 

You decide to take a chance. You brush at the bee to get it off. It comes right back, buzzing louder, angrier. Guess that wasn't the right decision! You don't care; you try to brush it off again. You feel a prick on your thumb, the bee bumps your hand again and falls to the ground. It stung you! You're not sure why, but you're not afraid. It does hurt, throbbing a bit, swollen a tiny amount. You head back home to see if you should go to the hospital. 
You get home, and your mother is there.
 You show her and she's worried, but calm in the same way you've been. She tells you she'll drive you to the hospital since it might cause problems. You get in the car, and she drives you there. You don't think you're worried, but you are a little nervous now that you're honest with yourself.
