You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you.

 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you.

 You have experienced normal degradation, but the people around you, who all appear young, are very different form you. They are cold, unfeeling, and distant. You hardly go outside anymore, in your golden years. You can't stand to be around them. 
You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train.

You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train.

You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you.

You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train.

 You have experienced normal degradation, but the people around you, who all appear young, are very different form you. They are cold, unfeeling, and distant. You hardly go outside anymore, in your golden years. You can't stand to be around them. 
You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train. 

Once you're on the floor, she begins tearing at your flesh. She takes bite sized chunks of your flesh into her mouth and swallows. She takes your blood into her mouth and drinks it. She is consuming you. Th",2428,[],3,3,5,30,0.3,1,0,0,1886

 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children.

 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok.

You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train.

 You have experienced normal degradation, but the people around you, who all appear young, are very different form you. They are cold, unfeeling, and distant. You hardly go outside anymore, in your golden years. You can't stand to be around them. 
You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok.

She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train. 

Once you're on the floor, she begins tearing at your flesh. She takes bite sized chunks of your flesh into her mouth and swallows. She takes your blood into her mouth and drinks it.

You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train. 

Once you're on the floor, she begins tearing at your flesh. She takes bite sized chunks of your flesh into her mouth and swallows. She takes your blood into her mouth and drinks it. She is consuming you. You are terrified beyond belief. The world grows dark and you lose consciousness. Your last thought is, ""the world is ending.""

You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train. 

Once you're on the floor, she begins tearing at your flesh. She takes bite sized chunks of your flesh into her mouth and swallows. She takes your blood into her mouth and drinks it. She is consuming you. You are terrified beyond belief. The world grows dark and you lose consciousness. Your last thought is, ""the world is ending.""

 You have experienced normal degradation, but the people around you, who all appear young, are very different form you. They are cold, unfeeling, and distant. You hardly go outside anymore, in your golden years. You can't stand to be around them. 
You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train. 

Once you're on the floor, she begins tearing at your flesh. She takes bite sized chunks of your flesh into her mouth and swallows. She takes your blood into her mouth and drinks it.

You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train. 

Once you're on the floor, she begins tearing at your flesh. She takes bite sized chunks of your flesh into her mouth and swallows. She takes your blood into her mouth and drinks it. She is consuming you. You are terrified beyond belief. The world grows dark and you lose consciousness. Your last thought is, ""the world is ending.""

 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok.

She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train. 

Once you're on the floor, she begins tearing at your flesh. She takes bite sized chunks of your flesh into her mouth and swallows. She takes your blood into her mouth and drinks it.

 You have experienced normal degradation, but the people around you, who all appear young, are very different form you. They are cold, unfeeling, and distant. You hardly go outside anymore, in your golden years. You can't stand to be around them. 
You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train. 

Once you're on the floor, she begins tearing at your flesh. She takes bite sized chunks of your flesh into her mouth and swallows. She takes your blood into her mouth and drinks it. She is consuming you. You are terrified beyond belief. The world grows dark and you lose consciousness. Your last thought is, ""the world is ending.""

Once you're on the floor, she begins tearing at your flesh. She takes bite sized chunks of your flesh into her mouth and swallows. She takes your blood into her mouth and drinks it. She is consuming you. You are terrified beyond belief. The world grows dark and you lose consciousness. Your last thought is, ""the world is ending."" You never find out about it because of your demise, but the world really does end. People eat one another until there are only a few left, who become feral and live out their days alone, too paranoid to form groups. Humanity got too greedy, in their quest for more life they have become extinct.",2848,[],3,3,5,30,0.3,1,0,0,2392
