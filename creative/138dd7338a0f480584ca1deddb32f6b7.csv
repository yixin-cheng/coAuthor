 The entire social order has been challenged. No longer can anyone take credit where credit is not necessarily due. The fathers of the world are actually going to have to start putting some effort into it, if they want to maintain a decent ranking.

Now it was serious, a challenge, a competition. The days of coasting on the ""fatherhood credit"" are over.

Fathers everywhere start looking for new, creative ways to express love and caring. No more hammering a winning attitude and hoping for a sports star attitude. If your kid hates you, your ranking will reflect that. You must get creative. Some fathers find that asking their children what they would actually like to spend time doing is the best approach. Some fathers find that they don't need to ask, but if they just listen they will find the answer. The result of the new system of fathers day gift rankings results in a much more open minded, sophisticated approach to fatherhood. Many have speculated that this new era of fatherhood will rival the renaissance.

And why not? A new school of thought on one of the most basic elements of life on this planet is bound to have a significant impact on the evolution of society. It will be the catalyst for a new age. Where it goes, nobody can tell just yet. One thing is for sure, as fathers become more adept at learning and listening, the next generation will come out of the gate a lot stronger.

Fathers everywhere start looking for new, creative ways to express love and caring. No more hammering a winning attitude and hoping for a sports star attitude. If your kid hates you, your ranking will reflect that. You must get creative. Some fathers find that asking their children what they would actually like to spend time doing is the best approach. Some fathers find that they don't need to ask, but if they just listen they will find the answer. The result of the new system of fathers day gift rankings results in a much more open minded, sophisticated approach to fatherhood. Many have speculated that this new era of fatherhood will rival the renaissance.

And why not? A new school of thought on one of the most basic elements of life on this planet is bound to have a significant impact on the evolution of society. It will be the catalyst for a new age. Where it goes, nobody can tell just yet. One thing is for sure, as fathers become more adept at learning and listening, the next generation will come out of the gate a lot stronger. Maybe they won't need a ranking system at all. Maybe the future will be brighter for everyone, as our egotistical rating system becomes a demand that we do better, as people.

Some fathers find that they don't need to ask, but if they just listen they will find the answer. The result of the new system of fathers day gift rankings results in a much more open minded, sophisticated approach to fatherhood. Many have speculated that this new era of fatherhood will rival the renaissance.

Many have speculated that this new era of fatherhood will rival the renaissance.
