In my opinion, people, even in a democratic nation,  have no responsibilities beyond the immediate ones of taking care of themselves and their families, and fulfilling duties in their neighborhoods and workplaces. So, no, I do not believe in making keeping informed of current events a priority.  In fact, in today's society, increasing numbers of individuals are failing to fulfill their actual responsibilities of feeding and clothing their families, paying their bills, etc.. It's entirely possible that these people who are neglecting their real responsibilities are spending more time online in social networks, and paying more attention to current events as a result. In that case, keeping engaged with 'the world' is not only not helping to make them better citizens, it is actually making them worse, ones given that they are neglecting their legitimate duties.

In my opinion, people, even in a democratic nation,  have no responsibilities beyond the immediate ones of taking care of themselves and their families, and fulfilling duties in their neighborhoods and workplaces. So, no, I do not believe in making keeping informed of current events a priority.

It's entirely possible that these people who are neglecting their real responsibilities are spending more time online in social networks, and paying more attention to current events as a result. In that case, keeping engaged with 'the world' is not only not helping to make them better citizens, it is actually making them worse, ones given that they are neglecting their legitimate duties.

In my opinion, people, even in a democratic nation,  have no responsibilities beyond the immediate ones of taking care of themselves and their families, and fulfilling duties in their neighborhoods and workplaces. So, no, I do not believe in making keeping informed of current events a priority.

In my opinion, people, even in a democratic nation,  have no responsibilities beyond the immediate ones of taking care of themselves and their families, and fulfilling duties in their neighborhoods and workplaces. So, no, I do not believe in making keeping informed of current events a priority.  In fact, in today's society, increasing numbers of individuals are failing to fulfill their actual responsibilities of feeding and clothing their families, paying their bills, etc.. It's entirely possible that these people who are neglecting their real responsibilities are spending more time online in social networks, and paying more attention to current events as a result. In that case, keeping engaged with 'the world' is not only not helping to make them better citizens, it is actually making them worse, ones given that they are neglecting their legitimate duties.

Assuming that one *is* taking care of their actual responsibilities though, and wishes to become informed on current events, I question the feasibility of doing so. The amount of information is so vast, and it is so difficult to separate the useful information from the useless and even harmful stuff, that I'm uncertain that the average citizen could accomplish that feat even if they wanted to.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people, even in a democratic nation,  have no responsibilities beyond the immediate ones of taking care of themselves and their families, and fulfilling duties in their neighborhoods and workplaces. So, no, I do not believe in making keeping informed of current events a priority.  In fact, in today's society, increasing numbers of individuals are failing to fulfill their actual responsibilities of feeding and clothing their families, paying their bills, etc.. It's entirely possible that these people who are neglecting their real responsibilities are spending more time online in social networks, and paying more attention to current events as a result. In that case, keeping engaged with 'the world' is not only not helping to make them better citizens, it is actually making them worse, ones given that they are neglecting their legitimate duties.

Assuming that one *is* taking care of their actual responsibilities though, and wishes to become informed on current events, I question the feasibility of doing so. The amount of information is so vast, and it is so difficult to separate the useful information from the useless and even harmful stuff, that I'm uncertain that the average citizen could accomplish that feat even if they wanted to. Just making the effort , and taking the time, to become usefully informed on all current events could prove to be such a tremendous drain on time and resources, that having the time to fulfill one's proper duties might become problematic.

So, no, I do not believe in making keeping informed of current events a priority.  In fact, in today's society, increasing numbers of individuals are failing to fulfill their actual responsibilities of feeding and clothing their families, paying their bills, etc.. It's entirely possible that these people who are neglecting their real responsibilities are spending more time online in social networks, and paying more attention to current events as a result. In that case, keeping engaged with 'the world' is not only not helping to make them better citizens, it is actually making them worse, ones given that they are neglecting their legitimate duties.

Assuming that one *is* taking care of their actual responsibilities though, and wishes to become informed on current events, I question the feasibility of doing so. The amount of information is so vast, and it is so difficult to separate the useful information from the useless and even harmful stuff, that I'm uncertain that the average citizen could accomplish that feat even if they wanted to. Just making the effort , and taking the time, to become usefully informed on all current events could prove to be such a tremendous drain on time and resources, that having the time to fulfill one's proper duties might become problematic.

So, no, I do not believe in making keeping informed of current events a priority.  In fact, in today's society, increasing numbers of individuals are failing to fulfill their actual responsibilities of feeding and clothing their families, paying their bills, etc.. It's entirely possible that these people who are neglecting their real responsibilities are spending more time online in social networks, and paying more attention to current events as a result. In that case, keeping engaged with 'the world' is not only not helping to make them better citizens, it is actually making them worse, ones given that they are neglecting their legitimate duties.

Assuming that one *is* taking care of their actual responsibilities though, and wishes to become informed on current events, I question the feasibility of doing so. The amount of information is so vast, and it is so difficult to separate the useful information from the useless and even harmful stuff, that I'm uncertain that the average citizen could accomplish that feat even if they wanted to. Just making the effort , and taking the time, to become usefully informed on all current events could prove to be such a tremendous drain on time and resources, that having the time to fulfill one's proper duties might become problematic.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people, even in a democratic nation,  have no responsibilities beyond the immediate ones of taking care of themselves and their families, and fulfilling duties in their neighborhoods and workplaces. So, no, I do not believe in making keeping informed of current events a priority.  In fact, in today's society, increasing numbers of individuals are failing to fulfill their actual responsibilities of feeding and clothing their families, paying their bills, etc.. It's entirely possible that these people who are neglecting their real responsibilities are spending more time online in social networks, and paying more attention to current events as a result. In that case, keeping engaged with 'the world' is not only not helping to make them better citizens, it is actually making them worse, ones given that they are neglecting their legitimate duties.

Assuming that one *is* taking care of their actual responsibilities though, and wishes to become informed on current events, I question the feasibility of doing so. The amount of information is so vast, and it is so difficult to separate the useful information from the useless and even harmful stuff, that I'm uncertain that the average citizen could accomplish that feat even if they wanted to. Just making the effort , and taking the time, to become usefully informed on all current events could prove to be such a tremendous drain on time and resources, that having the time to fulfill one's proper duties might become problematic.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people, even in a democratic nation,  have no responsibilities beyond the immediate ones of taking care of themselves and their families, and fulfilling duties in their neighborhoods and workplaces. So, no, I do not believe in making keeping informed of current events a priority.  In fact, in today's society, increasing numbers of individuals are failing to fulfill their actual responsibilities of feeding and clothing their families, paying their bills, etc.. It's entirely possible that these people who are neglecting their real responsibilities are spending more time online in social networks, and paying more attention to current events as a result. In that case, keeping engaged with 'the world' is not only not helping to make them better citizens, it is actually making them worse, ones given that they are neglecting their legitimate duties.

Assuming that one *is* taking care of their actual responsibilities though, and wishes to become informed on current events, I question the feasibility of doing so. The amount of information is so vast, and it is so difficult to separate the useful information from the useless and even harmful stuff, that I'm uncertain that the average citizen could accomplish that feat even if they wanted to. Just making the effort , and taking the time, to become usefully informed on all current events could prove to be such a tremendous drain on time and resources, that having the time to fulfill one's proper duties might become problematic.

The idea of the good citizen, simply being one who cares enough about society to get informed on what is going on in the world, and then being able to make informed political choices, is an appealing one. But in today's world, with contemporary technology and institutions, I suspect that the achievement of such a citizen is becoming more and more difficult.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people, even in a democratic nation,  have no responsibilities beyond the immediate ones of taking care of themselves and their families, and fulfilling duties in their neighborhoods and workplaces. So, no, I do not believe in making keeping informed of current events a priority.  In fact, in today's society, increasing numbers of individuals are failing to fulfill their actual responsibilities of feeding and clothing their families, paying their bills, etc.. It's entirely possible that these people who are neglecting their real responsibilities are spending more time online in social networks, and paying more attention to current events as a result. In that case, keeping engaged with 'the world' is not only not helping to make them better citizens, it is actually making them worse, ones given that they are neglecting their legitimate duties.

Assuming that one *is* taking care of their actual responsibilities though, and wishes to become informed on current events, I question the feasibility of doing so. The amount of information is so vast, and it is so difficult to separate the useful information from the useless and even harmful stuff, that I'm uncertain that the average citizen could accomplish that feat even if they wanted to. Just making the effort , and taking the time, to become usefully informed on all current events could prove to be such a tremendous drain on time and resources, that having the time to fulfill one's proper duties might become problematic.

The idea of the good citizen, simply being one who cares enough about society to get informed on what is going on in the world, and then being able to make informed political choices, is an appealing one.

In my opinion, people, even in a democratic nation,  have no responsibilities beyond the immediate ones of taking care of themselves and their families, and fulfilling duties in their neighborhoods and workplaces. So, no, I do not believe in making keeping informed of current events a priority.

It's entirely possible that these people who are neglecting their real responsibilities are spending more time online in social networks, and paying more attention to current events as a result. In that case, keeping engaged with 'the world' is not only not helping to make them better citizens, it is actually making them worse, ones given that they are neglecting their legitimate duties.

In my opinion, people, even in a democratic nation,  have no responsibilities beyond the immediate ones of taking care of themselves and their families, and fulfilling duties in their neighborhoods and workplaces. So, no, I do not believe in making keeping informed of current events a priority.  In fact, in today's society, increasing numbers of individuals are failing to fulfill their actual responsibilities of feeding and clothing their families, paying their bills, etc.. It's entirely possible that these people who are neglecting their real responsibilities are spending more time online in social networks, and paying more attention to current events as a result. In that case, keeping engaged with 'the world' is not only not helping to make them better citizens, it is actually making them worse, ones given that they are neglecting their legitimate duties.

Assuming that one *is* taking care of their actual responsibilities though, and wishes to become informed on current events, I question the feasibility of doing so. The amount of information is so vast, and it is so difficult to separate the useful information from the useless and even harmful stuff, that I'm uncertain that the average citizen could accomplish that feat even if they wanted to. Just making the effort , and taking the time, to become usefully informed on all current events could prove to be such a tremendous drain on time and resources, that having the time to fulfill one's proper duties might become problematic.

The idea of the good citizen, simply being one who cares enough about society to get informed on what is going on in the world, and then being able to make informed political choices, is an appealing one.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people, even in a democratic nation,  have no responsibilities beyond the immediate ones of taking care of themselves and their families, and fulfilling duties in their neighborhoods and workplaces. So, no, I do not believe in making keeping informed of current events a priority.  In fact, in today's society, increasing numbers of individuals are failing to fulfill their actual responsibilities of feeding and clothing their families, paying their bills, etc.. It's entirely possible that these people who are neglecting their real responsibilities are spending more time online in social networks, and paying more attention to current events as a result. In that case, keeping engaged with 'the world' is not only not helping to make them better citizens, it is actually making them worse, ones given that they are neglecting their legitimate duties.

Assuming that one *is* taking care of their actual responsibilities though, and wishes to become informed on current events, I question the feasibility of doing so. The amount of information is so vast, and it is so difficult to separate the useful information from the useless and even harmful stuff, that I'm uncertain that the average citizen could accomplish that feat even if they wanted to. Just making the effort , and taking the time, to become usefully informed on all current events could prove to be such a tremendous drain on time and resources, that having the time to fulfill one's proper duties might become problematic.

The idea of the good citizen, simply being one who cares enough about society to get informed on what is going on in the world, and then being able to make informed political choices, is an appealing one. But in today's world, with contemporary technology and institutions, I suspect that the achievement of such a citizen is becoming more and more difficult.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people, even in a democratic nation,  have no responsibilities beyond the immediate ones of taking care of themselves and their families, and fulfilling duties in their neighborhoods and workplaces. So, no, I do not believe in making keeping informed of current events a priority.  In fact, in today's society, increasing numbers of individuals are failing to fulfill their actual responsibilities of feeding and clothing their families, paying their bills, etc.. It's entirely possible that these people who are neglecting their real responsibilities are spending more time online in social networks, and paying more attention to current events as a result. In that case, keeping engaged with 'the world' is not only not helping to make them better citizens, it is actually making them worse, ones given that they are neglecting their legitimate duties.

Assuming that one *is* taking care of their actual responsibilities though, and wishes to become informed on current events, I question the feasibility of doing so. The amount of information is so vast, and it is so difficult to separate the useful information from the useless and even harmful stuff, that I'm uncertain that the average citizen could accomplish that feat even if they wanted to. Just making the effort , and taking the time, to become usefully informed on all current events could prove to be such a tremendous drain on time and resources, that having the time to fulfill one's proper duties might become problematic.

The idea of the good citizen, simply being one who cares enough about society to get informed on what is going on in the world, and then being able to make informed political choices, is an appealing one. But in today's world, with contemporary technology and institutions, I suspect that the achievement of such a citizen is becoming more and more difficult.

In my opinion, people, even in a democratic nation,  have no responsibilities beyond the immediate ones of taking care of themselves and their families, and fulfilling duties in their neighborhoods and workplaces. So, no, I do not believe in making keeping informed of current events a priority.  In fact, in today's society, increasing numbers of individuals are failing to fulfill their actual responsibilities of feeding and clothing their families, paying their bills, etc.. It's entirely possible that these people who are neglecting their real responsibilities are spending more time online in social networks, and paying more attention to current events as a result. In that case, keeping engaged with 'the world' is not only not helping to make them better citizens, it is actually making them worse, ones given that they are neglecting their legitimate duties.

Assuming that one *is* taking care of their actual responsibilities though, and wishes to become informed on current events, I question the feasibility of doing so. The amount of information is so vast, and it is so difficult to separate the useful information from the useless and even harmful stuff, that I'm uncertain that the average citizen could accomplish that feat even if they wanted to. Just making the effort , and taking the time, to become usefully informed on all current events could prove to be such a tremendous drain on time and resources, that having the time to fulfill one's proper duties might become problematic.

The idea of the good citizen, simply being one who cares enough about society to get informed on what is going on in the world, and then being able to make informed political choices, is an appealing one.

In my opinion, people, even in a democratic nation,  have no responsibilities beyond the immediate ones of taking care of themselves and their families, and fulfilling duties in their neighborhoods and workplaces. So, no, I do not believe in making keeping informed of current events a priority.  In fact, in today's society, increasing numbers of individuals are failing to fulfill their actual responsibilities of feeding and clothing their families, paying their bills, etc.. It's entirely possible that these people who are neglecting their real responsibilities are spending more time online in social networks, and paying more attention to current events as a result. In that case, keeping engaged with 'the world' is not only not helping to make them better citizens, it is actually making them worse, ones given that they are neglecting their legitimate duties.

Assuming that one *is* taking care of their actual responsibilities though, and wishes to become informed on current events, I question the feasibility of doing so. The amount of information is so vast, and it is so difficult to separate the useful information from the useless and even harmful stuff, that I'm uncertain that the average citizen could accomplish that feat even if they wanted to. Just making the effort , and taking the time, to become usefully informed on all current events could prove to be such a tremendous drain on time and resources, that having the time to fulfill one's proper duties might become problematic.

In my opinion, people, even in a democratic nation,  have no responsibilities beyond the immediate ones of taking care of themselves and their families, and fulfilling duties in their neighborhoods and workplaces. So, no, I do not believe in making keeping informed of current events a priority.  In fact, in today's society, increasing numbers of individuals are failing to fulfill their actual responsibilities of feeding and clothing their families, paying their bills, etc.. It's entirely possible that these people who are neglecting their real responsibilities are spending more time online in social networks, and paying more attention to current events as a result. In that case, keeping engaged with 'the world' is not only not helping to make them better citizens, it is actually making them worse, ones given that they are neglecting their legitimate duties.

It's entirely possible that these people who are neglecting their real responsibilities are spending more time online in social networks, and paying more attention to current events as a result. In that case, keeping engaged with 'the world' is not only not helping to make them better citizens, it is actually making them worse, ones given that they are neglecting their legitimate duties.

Assuming that one *is* taking care of their actual responsibilities though, and wishes to become informed on current events, I question the feasibility of doing so. The amount of information is so vast, and it is so difficult to separate the useful information from the useless and even harmful stuff, that I'm uncertain that the average citizen could accomplish that feat even if they wanted to. Just making the effort , and taking the time, to become usefully informed on all current events could prove to be such a tremendous drain on time and resources, that having the time to fulfill one's proper duties might become problematic.

The idea of the good citizen, simply being one who cares enough about society to get informed on what is going on in the world, and then being able to make informed political choices, is an appealing one.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people, even in a democratic nation,  have no responsibilities beyond the immediate ones of taking care of themselves and their families, and fulfilling duties in their neighborhoods and workplaces. So, no, I do not believe in making keeping informed of current events a priority.  In fact, in today's society, increasing numbers of individuals are failing to fulfill their actual responsibilities of feeding and clothing their families, paying their bills, etc.. It's entirely possible that these people who are neglecting their real responsibilities are spending more time online in social networks, and paying more attention to current events as a result. In that case, keeping engaged with 'the world' is not only not helping to make them better citizens, it is actually making them worse, ones given that they are neglecting their legitimate duties.

Assuming that one *is* taking care of their actual responsibilities though, and wishes to become informed on current events, I question the feasibility of doing so. The amount of information is so vast, and it is so difficult to separate the useful information from the useless and even harmful stuff, that I'm uncertain that the average citizen could accomplish that feat even if they wanted to. Just making the effort , and taking the time, to become usefully informed on all current events could prove to be such a tremendous drain on time and resources, that having the time to fulfill one's proper duties might become problematic.

The idea of the good citizen, simply being one who cares enough about society to get informed on what is going on in the world, and then being able to make informed political choices, is an appealing one. But in today's world, with contemporary technology and institutions, I suspect that the achievement of such a citizen is becoming more and more difficult.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people, even in a democratic nation,  have no responsibilities beyond the immediate ones of taking care of themselves and their families, and fulfilling duties in their neighborhoods and workplaces. So, no, I do not believe in making keeping informed of current events a priority.  In fact, in today's society, increasing numbers of individuals are failing to fulfill their actual responsibilities of feeding and clothing their families, paying their bills, etc.. It's entirely possible that these people who are neglecting their real responsibilities are spending more time online in social networks, and paying more attention to current events as a result. In that case, keeping engaged with 'the world' is not only not helping to make them better citizens, it is actually making them worse, ones given that they are neglecting their legitimate duties.

Assuming that one *is* taking care of their actual responsibilities though, and wishes to become informed on current events, I question the feasibility of doing so. The amount of information is so vast, and it is so difficult to separate the useful information from the useless and even harmful stuff, that I'm uncertain that the average citizen could accomplish that feat even if they wanted to. Just making the effort , and taking the time, to become usefully informed on all current events could prove to be such a tremendous drain on time and resources, that having the time to fulfill one's proper duties might become problematic.

The idea of the good citizen, simply being one who cares enough about society to get informed on what is going on in the world, and then being able to make informed political choices, is an appealing one. But in today's world, with contemporary technology and institutions, I suspect that the achievement of such a citizen is becoming more and more difficult.

It's entirely possible that these people who are neglecting their real responsibilities are spending more time online in social networks, and paying more attention to current events as a result. In that case, keeping engaged with 'the world' is not only not helping to make them better citizens, it is actually making them worse, ones given that they are neglecting their legitimate duties.

Assuming that one *is* taking care of their actual responsibilities though, and wishes to become informed on current events, I question the feasibility of doing so. The amount of information is so vast, and it is so difficult to separate the useful information from the useless and even harmful stuff, that I'm uncertain that the average citizen could accomplish that feat even if they wanted to. Just making the effort , and taking the time, to become usefully informed on all current events could prove to be such a tremendous drain on time and resources, that having the time to fulfill one's proper duties might become problematic.

The idea of the good citizen, simply being one who cares enough about society to get informed on what is going on in the world, and then being able to make informed political choices, is an appealing one. But in today's world, with contemporary technology and institutions, I suspect that the achievement of such a citizen is becoming more and more difficult.

In my opinion, people, even in a democratic nation,  have no responsibilities beyond the immediate ones of taking care of themselves and their families, and fulfilling duties in their neighborhoods and workplaces. So, no, I do not believe in making keeping informed of current events a priority.

It's entirely possible that these people who are neglecting their real responsibilities are spending more time online in social networks, and paying more attention to current events as a result. In that case, keeping engaged with 'the world' is not only not helping to make them better citizens, it is actually making them worse, ones given that they are neglecting their legitimate duties.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people, even in a democratic nation,  have no responsibilities beyond the immediate ones of taking care of themselves and their families, and fulfilling duties in their neighborhoods and workplaces. So, no, I do not believe in making keeping informed of current events a priority.  In fact, in today's society, increasing numbers of individuals are failing to fulfill their actual responsibilities of feeding and clothing their families, paying their bills, etc.. It's entirely possible that these people who are neglecting their real responsibilities are spending more time online in social networks, and paying more attention to current events as a result. In that case, keeping engaged with 'the world' is not only not helping to make them better citizens, it is actually making them worse, ones given that they are neglecting their legitimate duties.

Assuming that one *is* taking care of their actual responsibilities though, and wishes to become informed on current events, I question the feasibility of doing so. The amount of information is so vast, and it is so difficult to separate the useful information from the useless and even harmful stuff, that I'm uncertain that the average citizen could accomplish that feat even if they wanted to. Just making the effort , and taking the time, to become usefully informed on all current events could prove to be such a tremendous drain on time and resources, that having the time to fulfill one's proper duties might become problematic.

The idea of the good citizen, simply being one who cares enough about society to get informed on what is going on in the world, and then being able to make informed political choices, is an appealing one.
