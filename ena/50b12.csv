Another condition imposed at the end of World War III was the destruction of all nuclear weapons. This, the other nations had complied with, but they had secretly built up their conventional forces to the point where they could defeat the United States in a non-nuclear war.

In fact, the U.S. had used the period of isolation to build up their nuclear forces to the point where they could destroy the rest of the world several times over, and had been planning to do so. The first thing the U.S. did upon receiving the declarations of war, was to launch a preemptive strike against the island of Japan, which had become the center of the anti-American alliance. Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed, again, and the Japanese surrendered. The Americans showed no pity though, and proceeded to destroy every major city in Japan. Unlike the nuclear bombings that ended WWII, this time, nothing would be rebuilt.

The anti-American alliance was shocked at the U.S.'s response, but they had no choice but to fight back. They launched an attack against the U.S. in the Pacific, and the U.S. responded by launching a nuclear attack on the Chinese mainland. Soon, China was a nuclear wasteland, and the U.S. was launching nuclear attacks on the rest of the anti-American alliance.

The anti-American alliance was shocked at the U.S.'s response, but they had no choice but to fight back. They launched an attack against the U.S. in the Pacific, and the U.S. responded by launching a nuclear attack on the Chinese mainland.

Another condition imposed at the end of World War III was the destruction of all nuclear weapons. This, the other nations had complied with, but they had secretly built up their conventional forces to the point where they could defeat the United States in a non-nuclear war. Since the U.S. was gullible enough to fall for the ruse of isolation, they assumed that the U.S. had complied with the nuclear disarmament, and were shocked when they found out that the U.S. had not.

In fact, the U.S. had used the period of isolation to build up their nuclear forces to the point where they could destroy the rest of the world several times over, and had been planning to do so. The first thing the U.S. did upon receiving the declarations of war, was to launch a preemptive strike against the island of Japan, which had become the center of the anti-American alliance. Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed, again, and the Japanese surrendered. The Americans showed no pity though, and proceeded to destroy every major city in Japan.

The anti-American alliance was shocked at the U.S.'s response, but they had no choice but to fight back. They launched an attack against the U.S. in the Pacific, and the U.S. responded by launching a nuclear attack on the Chinese mainland.
