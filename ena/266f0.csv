Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish.

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal.

You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that.

You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. ",user,20,23,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal.

That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

As far as if the risk overall is selfish or not has so many factors. I do not believe it is selfish.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

As far as if the risk overall is selfish or not has so many factors. I do not believe it is selfish. I know many people would disagree with me when they hear about someone accidentally dying while trying to do a stunt. However, the people who are doing those stunts are aware of the risks and possible outcomes. That's a isk they are willing to make and I accept their cho",user,30,29,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice.

We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish.

So each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that.

I know many people would disagree with me when they hear about someone accidentally dying while trying to do a stunt. However, the people who are doing those stunts are aware of the risks and possible outcomes. That's a risk they are willing to make and I accept their choice. If they are okay with it then I can not consider it to be selfish. ",user,34,14,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0
