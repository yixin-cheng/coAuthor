The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" that stuff will kill you, you better come out of there right away. The little pig knew better. The wolf was simply trying to trick him so he lore him out and eat him. I'm not coming out, by the hair that used to be on my chinny chin chin. The wolf was torn because he very much wanted to eat the pig but at the same time knew if the pig stayed in there two long the body would become irradiated, making the pig inedible.   The wolf thought and thought, what should he do?
Finally he came to a decision, he would try to set the house on fire. This would surely force the little piggy out from his uranium home. The wolf went to collect some flammable materials and lined them up along the house. When everything was in place the wolf struck a match and ran away.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" that stuff will kill you, you better come out of there right away. The little pig knew better.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" that stuff will kill you, you better come out of there right away. The little pig knew better.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" that stuff will kill you, you better come out of there right away. The little pig knew better. The wolf was simply trying to trick him so he lore him out and eat him. I'm not coming out, by the hair that used to be on my chinny chin chin. The wolf was torn because he very much wanted to eat the pig but at the same time knew if the pig stayed in there two long the body would become irradiated, making the pig inedible.   The wolf thought and thought, what should he do?
Finally he came to a decision, he would try to set the house on fire. This would surely force the little piggy out from his uranium home. The wolf went to collect some flammable materials and lined them up along the house. When everything was in place the wolf struck a match and ran away. It took a while but finally the sides started to smoke. The pig was seen running back and forth through out the house trying to put out the fires that sprung up everywhere.   The wolf was like, ""he's coming out."" any time now, he will be out of there and I will eat him. As the wolf was daydreaming about his next meal, smoke was starting to thicken up around the house.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" that stuff will kill you, you better come out of there right away. The little pig knew better. The wolf was simply trying to trick him so he lore him out and eat him. I'm not coming out, by the hair that used to be on my chinny chin chin. The wolf was torn because he very much wanted to eat the pig but at the same time knew if the pig stayed in there two long the body would become irradiated, making the pig inedible.   The wolf thought and thought, what should he do?
Finally he came to a decision, he would try to set the house on fire. This would surely force the little piggy out from his uranium home. The wolf went to collect some flammable materials and lined them up along the house. When everything was in place the wolf struck a match and ran away. It took a while but finally the sides started to smoke. The pig was seen running back and forth through out the house trying to put out the fires that sprung up everywhere.   The wolf was like, ""he's coming out."" any time now, he will be out of there and I will eat him. As the wolf was daydreaming about his next meal, smoke was starting to thicken up around the house. Then wolf then looked in the window to see that the pig had fallen to the ground, unconscious. The wolf started to feel very dizzy and sick to his stomach. By this time the smoke was so thick around the house that the wolf could not see two feet in front of him.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" that stuff will kill you, you better come out of there right away. The little pig knew better. The wolf was simply trying to trick him so he lore him out and eat him. I'm not coming out, by the hair that used to be on my chinny chin chin. The wolf was torn because he very much wanted to eat the pig but at the same time knew if the pig stayed in there two long the body would become irradiated, making the pig inedible.   The wolf thought and thought, what should he do?
Finally he came to a decision, he would try to set the house on fire. This would surely force the little piggy out from his uranium home.
