This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office.

This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis.

There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens.

This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea.

I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time.

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore.

I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time.

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content.

So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea.

My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore.

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office.

But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time.

This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a",user,29,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,26

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea.

I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to ju",user,29,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,26

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows.

There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a",user,29,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,26

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea.

This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens.",user,29,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,26

So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,27

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time.

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content.

This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,27

I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,28

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever se

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Soc

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Networ

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,28

I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network document

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,28

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families.

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,28

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time.

So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,28

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning...

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself.

I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning...

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm t

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning...

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That do

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning...

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea.

I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning...

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens.

My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,29

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office.

It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time.

I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,29

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office.

It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time.

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,29

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office.

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,29

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning...

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,29

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning...

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens.

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,29

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning...

There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning...

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,29

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,29

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning...

Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into their phone

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,29

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into their phones and soci

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows.

That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into their phones and social media 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,29

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into their phones and social media accounts t

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,29

I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,29

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about.

This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into their phones and social media accounts that they practicall

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,29

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into their phones and social media accounts that they practically lost all

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea.

It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning...

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,29

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into their phones and social media accounts that they practically lost all sense of their s

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows?

It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about.

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,29

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into their phones and social media accounts that they practically lost all sense of self and eve

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows?

I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into their phones and social media accounts that they practically lost all sense of self and eventuall 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,29

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into their phones and social media accounts that they practically lost all sense of self and eventually event

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows.

I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time.

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,29

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,29

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into their phones and social media accounts that they practically lost all sense of self and eventually even lost a grip on re

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband.
