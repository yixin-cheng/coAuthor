""That's because must have agreed to make it and you are watching the result,"" he says.
""I don't remember agreeing to make a movie of my next life,"" you say.
 ""Of course not,"" replied the man, "" that is not how these things work.""
""How do they work?"" you ask.


""Your brain is erased between lives,"" says the man. ""Therefore, you don't remember making the movie.""

""But this is supposed to be my future, not my past,"" you say.
