In my opinion, this could be considered selfish if a person has a family and children at home. Whenever a person engages in an extreme sport, they are taking the danger and the risks that go with it.

In my opinion, this could be considered selfish if a person has a family and children at home. Whenever a person engages in an extreme sport, they are taking the danger and the risks that go with it. It is possible that they could end up leaving their family behind if they are injured or worse on one of these daring adventures. Although most people train hard for these experiences, not every scenario can be accounted for so a person could be left unprepared for many types of events. It is very rare that these kinds of accidents happen, but they do happen. While it is sometimes worth the risk to be happy, too much risk can come back to cause severe harm. The consideration has to be, how much of the sport is ingrained into a person's happiness and if the person gives up the sport so that they can be sure to be there for their family, will the person become resentful and angry?

It is possible that they could end up leaving their family behind if they are injured or worse on one of these daring adventures. Although most people train hard for these experiences, not every scenario can be accounted for so a person could be left unprepared for many types of events. It is very rare that these kinds of accidents happen, but they do happen. While it is sometimes worth the risk to be happy, too much risk can come back to cause severe harm. The consideration has to be, how much of the sport is ingrained into a person's happiness and if the person gives up the sport so that they can be sure to be there for their family, will the person become resentful and angry? It is the hard decision to make, but one that has to be made. Even though anything can happen at any time, there are activities that come with more risk than others. Extreme sports seem to be one of those. As much as a person does not want to admit this fact, their family might be the thing that makes sure they are always careful and never taking any unnecessary chances.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, this could be considered selfish if a person has a family and children at home. Whenever a person engages in an extreme sport, they are taking the danger and the risks that go with it. It is possible that they could end up leaving their family behind if they are injured or worse on one of these daring adventures. Although most people train hard for these experiences, not every scenario can be accounted for so a person could be left unprepared for many types of events. It is very rare that these kinds of accidents happen, but they do happen. While it is sometimes worth the risk to be happy, too much risk can come back to cause severe harm. The consideration has to be, how much of the sport is ingrained into a person's happiness and if the person gives up the sport so that they can be sure to be there for their family, will the person become resentful and angry? It is the hard decision to make, but one that has to be made. Even though anything can happen at any time, there are activities that come with more risk than others.

In my opinion, this could be considered selfish if a person has a family and children at home. Whenever a person engages in an extreme sport, they are taking the danger and the risks that go with it. It is possible that they could end up leaving their family behind if they are injured or worse on one of these daring adventures. Although most people train hard for these experiences, not every scenario can be accounted for so a person could be left unprepared for many types of events. It is very rare that these kinds of accidents happen, but they do happen. While it is sometimes worth the risk to be happy, too much risk can come back to cause severe harm. The consideration has to be, how much of the sport is ingrained into a person's happiness and if the person gives up the sport so that they can be sure to be there for their family, will the person become resentful and angry? It is the hard decision to make, but one that has to be made. Even though anything can happen at any time, there are activities that come with more risk than others. Extreme sports seem to be one of those. As much as a person does not want to admit this fact, their family might be the thing that makes sure they are always careful and never taking any unnecessary chances. There are times when a person can think of the thrill that is felt on a mountain top or the one that is felt while doing a certain sport and nothing can really replace that feeling. The trouble is that these sensations are so controlled by adrenaline and endorphins that it is only a fleeting feeling. The feeling of wanting the thrill and ad",user,16,17,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Eventually, the feelings of wanting that rush will outweigh the need for family and a feeling of being at home. As a person's desire to pursue this thrill increases, their need for family decreases.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, this could be considered selfish if a person has a family and children at home. Whenever a person engages in an extreme sport, they are taking the danger and the risks that go with it. It is possible that they could end up leaving their family behind if they are injured or worse on one of these daring adventures. Although most people train hard for these experiences, not every scenario can be accounted for so a person could be left unprepared for many types of events. It is very rare that these kinds of accidents happen, but they do happen. While it is sometimes worth the risk to be happy, too much risk can come back to cause severe harm. The consideration has to be, how much of the sport is ingrained into a person's happiness and if the person gives up the sport so that they can be sure to be there for their family, will the person become resentful and angry? It is the hard decision to make, but one that has to be made. Even though anything can happen at any time, there are activities that come with more risk than others. Extreme sports seem to be one of those. As much as a person does not want to admit this fact, their family might be the thing that makes sure they are always careful and never taking any unnecessary chances.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, this could be considered selfish if a person has a family and children at home. Whenever a person engages in an extreme sport, they are taking the danger and the risks that go with it. It is possible that they could end up leaving their family behind if they are injured or worse on one of these daring adventures. Although most people train hard for these experiences, not every scenario can be accounted for so a person could be left unprepared for many types of events. It is very rare that these kinds of accidents happen, but they do happen. While it is sometimes worth the risk to be happy, too much risk can come back to cause severe harm. The consideration has to be, how much of the sport is ingrained into a person's happiness and if the person gives up the sport so that they can be sure to be there for their family, will the person become resentful and angry? It is the hard decision to make, but one that has to be made. Even though anything can happen at any time, there are activities that come with more risk than others. Extreme sports seem to be one of those. As much as a person does not want to admit this fact, their family might be the thing that makes sure they are always careful and never taking any unnecessary chances. There are times when a person can think of the thrill that is felt on a mountain top or the one that is felt while doing a certain sport and nothing can really replace that feeling. The trouble is that these sensations are so controlled by adrenaline and endorphins that it is only a fleeting feeling. The feeling of wanting the thrill and adrenaline rush will continue to increase over time. Eventually, the feelings of wanting that rush will outweigh the need for family and a feeling of being at home. As a person's desire to pursue this thrill increases, their need for family decreases.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, this could be considered selfish if a person has a family and children at home. Whenever a person engages in an extreme sport, they are taking the danger and the risks that go with it. It is possible that they could end up leaving their family behind if they are injured or worse on one of these daring adventures. Although most people train hard for these experiences, not every scenario can be accounted for so a person could be left unprepared for many types of events. It is very rare that these kinds of accidents happen, but they do happen. While it is sometimes worth the risk to be happy, too much risk can come back to cause severe harm. The consideration has to be, how much of the sport is ingrained into a person's happiness and if the person gives up the sport so that they can be sure to be there for their family, will the person become resentful and angry? It is the hard decision to make, but one that has to be made. Even though anything can happen at any time, there are activities that come with more risk than others. Extreme sports seem to be one of those. As much as a person does not want to admit this fact, their family might be the thing that makes sure they are always careful and never taking any unnecessary chances. There are times when a person can think of the thrill that is felt on a mountain top or the one that is felt while doing a certain sport and nothing can really replace that feeling. The trouble is that these sensations are so controlled by adrenaline and endorphins that it is only a fleeting feeling. The feeling of wanting the thrill and adrenaline rush will continue to increase over time.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, this could be considered selfish if a person has a family and children at home. Whenever a person engages in an extreme sport, they are taking the danger and the risks that go with it. It is possible that they could end up leaving their family behind if they are injured or worse on one of these daring adventures. Although most people train hard for these experiences, not every scenario can be accounted for so a person could be left unprepared for many types of events. It is very rare that these kinds of accidents happen, but they do happen. While it is sometimes worth the risk to be happy, too much risk can come back to cause severe harm. The consideration has to be, how much of the sport is ingrained into a person's happiness and if the person gives up the sport so that they can be sure to be there for their family, will the person become resentful and angry? It is the hard decision to make, but one that has to be made. Even though anything can happen at any time, there are activities that come with more risk than others. Extreme sports seem to be one of those. As much as a person does not want to admit this fact, their family might be the thing that makes sure they are always careful and never taking any unnecessary chances.

In my opinion, this could be considered selfish if a person has a family and children at home. Whenever a person engages in an extreme sport, they are taking the danger and the risks that go with it. It is possible that they could end up leaving their family behind if they are injured or worse on one of these daring adventures. Although most people train hard for these experiences, not every scenario can be accounted for so a person could be left unprepared for many types of events. It is very rare that these kinds of accidents happen, but they do happen. While it is sometimes worth the risk to be happy, too much risk can come back to cause severe harm. The consideration has to be, how much of the sport is ingrained into a person's happiness and if the person gives up the sport so that they can be sure to be there for their family, will the person become resentful and angry? It is the hard decision to make, but one that has to be made. Even though anything can happen at any time, there are activities that come with more risk than others. Extreme sports seem to be one of those. As much as a person does not want to admit this fact, their family might be the thing that makes sure they are always careful and never taking any unnecessary chances. There are times when a person can think of the thrill that is felt on a mountain top or the one that is felt while doing a certain sport and nothing can really replace that feeling. The trouble is that these sensations are so controlled by adrenaline and endorphins that it is only a fleeting feeling. The feeling of wanting the thrill and adrenaline rush will continue to increase over time. Eventually, the feelings of wanting that rush will outweigh the need for family and a feeling of being at home. As a person's desire to pursue this thrill increases, their need for family decreases.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

As much as a person does not want to admit this fact, their family might be the thing that makes sure they are always careful and never taking any unnecessary chances. There are times when a person can think of the thrill that is felt on a mountain top or the one that is felt while doing a certain sport and nothing can really replace that feeling. The trouble is that these sensations are so controlled by adrenaline and endorphins that it is only a fleeting feeling. The feeling of wanting the thrill and adrenaline rush will continue to increase over time. Eventually, the feelings of wanting that rush will outweigh the need for family and a feeling of being at home. As a person's desire to pursue this thrill increases, their need for family decreases.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, this could be considered selfish if a person has a family and children at home. Whenever a person engages in an extreme sport, they are taking the danger and the risks that go with it. It is possible that they could end up leaving their family behind if they are injured or worse on one of these daring adventures. Although most people train hard for these experiences, not every scenario can be accounted for so a person could be left unprepared for many types of events. It is very rare that these kinds of accidents happen, but they do happen. While it is sometimes worth the risk to be happy, too much risk can come back to cause severe harm. The consideration has to be, how much of the sport is ingrained into a person's happiness and if the person gives up the sport so that they can be sure to be there for their family, will the person become resentful and angry?
