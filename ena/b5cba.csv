We discover that a new war had broken out. It made World War III look like nothing. The world was in ruins, and the only nations that were left were the ones that were able to protect themselves from the war.

By just isolating the United States had somehow prevented its own demise. The other countries had some kind of issue that had escalated to the point of no return. Now it was up to the United States to try and get the world back up and running.
