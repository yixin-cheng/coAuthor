In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks.

If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones.

It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks.

If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple.

Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

By all means, look at different new sources, it's the way to help educate yourself, build knowledge and participate in financial matters.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

By all means, look at different new sources, it's the way to help educate yourself, build knowledge and participate in financial matters.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

By all means, look at different new sources, it's the way to help educate yourself, build knowledge and participate in financial matters. If anything we're responsible to our families and ourselves to be informed. We should know what laws and taxes affect us.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

By all means, look at different new sources, it's the way to help educate yourself, build knowledge and participate in financial matters.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

By all means, look at different new sources, it's the way to help educate yourself, build knowledge and participate in financial matters. If anything we're responsible to our families and ourselves to be informed. We should know what laws and taxes affect us. We should, furthermore, vote for politicians who can bring about the financial advantages, say for instance, lower taxes or investment in infrastructure from the government.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

By all means, look at different new sources, it's the way to help educate yourself, build knowledge and participate in financial matters. If anything we're responsible to our families and ourselves to be informed. We should know what laws and taxes affect us. We should, furthermore, vote for politicians who can bring about the financial advantages, say for instance, lower taxes or investment in infrastructure from the government.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

By all means, look at different new sources, it's the way to help educate yourself, build knowledge and participate in financial matters. If anything we're responsible to our families and ourselves to be informed. We should know what laws and taxes affect us. We should, furthermore, vote for politicians who can bring about the financial advantages, say for instance, lower taxes or investment in infrastructure from the government.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

By all means, look at different new sources, it's the way to help educate yourself, build knowledge and participate in financial matters. If anything we're responsible to our families and ourselves to be informed. We should know what laws and taxes affect us. We should, furthermore, vote for politicians who can bring about the financial advantages, say for instance, lower taxes or investment in infrastructure from the government.

If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

By all means, look at different new sources, it's the way to help educate yourself, build knowledge and participate in financial matters. If anything we're responsible to our families and ourselves to be informed. We should know what laws and taxes affect us. We should, furthermore, vote for politicians who can bring about the financial advantages, say for instance, lower taxes or investment in infrastructure from the government. We should be aware of the government's actions and how they affect us. We should influence the government and also get involved, if only in voting.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

By all means, look at different new sources, it's the way to help educate yourself, build knowledge and participate in financial matters. If anything we're responsible to our families and ourselves to be informed. We should know what laws and taxes affect us. We should, furthermore, vote for politicians who can bring about the financial advantages, say for instance, lower taxes or investment in infrastructure from the government.

Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

By all means, look at different new sources, it's the way to help educate yourself, build knowledge and participate in financial matters. If anything we're responsible to our families and ourselves to be informed. We should know what laws and taxes affect us. We should, furthermore, vote for politicians who can bring about the financial advantages, say for instance, lower taxes or investment in infrastructure from the government. We should be aware of the government's actions and how they affect us. We should influence the government and also get involved, if only in voting.

If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

By all means, look at different new sources, it's the way to help educate yourself, build knowledge and participate in financial matters. If anything we're responsible to our families and ourselves to be informed. We should know what laws and taxes affect us. We should, furthermore, vote for politicians who can bring about the financial advantages, say for instance, lower taxes or investment in infrastructure from the government. We should be aware of the government's actions and how they affect us. We should influence the government and also get involved, if only in voting.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

By all means, look at different new sources, it's the way to help educate yourself, build knowledge and participate in financial matters. If anything we're responsible to our families and ourselves to be informed. We should know what laws and taxes affect us. We should, furthermore, vote for politicians who can bring about the financial advantages, say for instance, lower taxes or investment in infrastructure from the government.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

By all means, look at different new sources, it's the way to help educate yourself, build knowledge and participate in financial matters. If anything we're responsible to our families and ourselves to be informed. We should know what laws and taxes affect us. We should, furthermore, vote for politicians who can bring about the financial advantages, say for instance, lower taxes or investment in infrastructure from the government. We should be aware of the government's actions and how they affect us. We should influence the government and also get involved, if only in voting.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

By all means, look at different new sources, it's the way to help educate yourself, build knowledge and participate in financial matters. If anything we're responsible to our families and ourselves to be informed. We should know what laws and taxes affect us. We should, furthermore, vote for politicians who can bring about the financial advantages, say for instance, lower taxes or investment in infrastructure from the government. We should be aware of the government's actions and how they affect us. We should influence the government and also get involved, if only in voting.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

By all means, look at different new sources, it's the way to help educate yourself, build knowledge and participate in financial matters. If anything we're responsible to our families and ourselves to be informed. We should know what laws and taxes affect us.

If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

By all means, look at different new sources, it's the way to help educate yourself, build knowledge and participate in financial matters. If anything we're responsible to our families and ourselves to be informed. We should know what laws and taxes affect us. We should, furthermore, vote for politicians who can bring about the financial advantages, say for instance, lower taxes or investment in infrastructure from the government. We should be aware of the government's actions and how they affect us. We should influence the government and also get involved, if only in voting.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

By all means, look at different new sources, it's the way to help educate yourself, build knowledge and participate in financial matters. If anything we're responsible to our families and ourselves to be informed. We should know what laws and taxes affect us. We should, furthermore, vote for politicians who can bring about the financial advantages, say for instance, lower taxes or investment in infrastructure from the government. We should be aware of the government's actions and how they affect us. We should influence the government and also get involved, if only in voting.

If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

By all means, look at different new sources, it's the way to help educate yourself, build knowledge and participate in financial matters. If anything we're responsible to our families and ourselves to be informed. We should know what laws and taxes affect us. We should, furthermore, vote for politicians who can bring about the financial advantages, say for instance, lower taxes or investment in infrastructure from the government. We should be aware of the government's actions and how they affect us. We should influence the government and also get involved, if only in voting.

Consider investing at least a few minutes every day to involving yourself in reading or watching news, make a goal and stick to it.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

If anything we're responsible to our families and ourselves to be informed. We should know what laws and taxes affect us.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

By all means, look at different new sources, it's the way to help educate yourself, build knowledge and participate in financial matters. If anything we're responsible to our families and ourselves to be informed. We should know what laws and taxes affect us. We should, furthermore, vote for politicians who can bring about the financial advantages, say for instance, lower taxes or investment in infrastructure from the government. We should be aware of the government's actions and how they affect us. We should influence the government and also get involved, if only in voting.

Consider investing at least a few minutes every day to involving yourself in reading or watching news, make a goal and stick to it. Find out what things affect you directly and involve force upon ways to improve that outcome. It will pay off if you focus. Knowing is almost always better than ignorance.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

By all means, look at different new sources, it's the way to help educate yourself, build knowledge and participate in financial matters. If anything we're responsible to our families and ourselves to be informed. We should know what laws and taxes affect us. We should, furthermore, vote for politicians who can bring about the financial advantages, say for instance, lower taxes or investment in infrastructure from the government. We should be aware of the government's actions and how they affect us. We should influence the government and also get involved, if only in voting.

Consider investing at least a few minutes every day to involving yourself in reading or watching news, make a goal and stick to it. Find out what things affect you directly and involve force upon ways to improve that outcome. It will pay off if you focus. Knowing is almost always better than ignorance.

If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

By all means, look at different new sources, it's the way to help educate yourself, build knowledge and participate in financial matters. If anything we're responsible to our families and ourselves to be informed. We should know what laws and taxes affect us. We should, furthermore, vote for politicians who can bring about the financial advantages, say for instance, lower taxes or investment in infrastructure from the government. We should be aware of the government's actions and how they affect us. We should influence the government and also get involved, if only in voting.

Consider investing at least a few minutes every day to involving yourself in reading or watching news, make a goal and stick to it.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions.

It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications.

Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

If anything we're responsible to our families and ourselves to be informed. We should know what laws and taxes affect us. We should, furthermore, vote for politicians who can bring about the financial advantages, say for instance, lower taxes or investment in infrastructure from the government. We should be aware of the government's actions and how they affect us. We should influence the government and also get involved, if only in voting.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications.
