Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Anyone who has had the opportunity to love an animal knows that the love they felt is not different from the love they feel toward humans. Love is  transformative, redemptive and the ultimate source of all morality. Studies purporting to be shocked that a human would save a beloved animal before an unknown human miss the fact that there is not distinction between love for different sentient beings.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths. The difference is that sociopaths are not capable of love, while people who do not love animals are simply incapable of seeing the world through their eyes.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths. The difference is that sociopaths are not capable of love, while people who do not love animals are simply incapable of seeing the world through their eyes. This is more a failure of empathy than of psychology, but it is a failure nonetheless.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Anyone who has had the opportunity to love an animal knows that the love they felt is not different from the love they feel toward humans. Love is  transformative, redemptive and the ultimate source of all morality. Studies purporting to be shocked that a human would save a beloved animal before an unknown human miss the fact that there is not distinction between love for different sentient beings.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths. The difference is that sociopaths are not capable of love, while people who do not love animals are simply incapable of seeing the world through their eyes. This is more a failure of empathy than of psychology, but it is a failure nonetheless.

Anyone who has had the opportunity to love an animal knows that the love they felt is not different from the love they feel toward humans. Love is  transformative, redemptive and the ultimate source of all morality. Studies purporting to be shocked that a human would save a beloved animal before an unknown human miss the fact that there is not distinction between love for different sentient beings.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths. The difference is that sociopaths are not capable of love, while people who do not love animals are simply incapable of seeing the world through their eyes. This is more a failure of empathy than of psychology, but it is a failure nonetheless.

Anyone who has had the opportunity to love an animal knows that the love they felt is not different from the love they feel toward humans. Love is  transformative, redemptive and the ultimate source of all morality. Studies purporting to be shocked that a human would save a beloved animal before an unknown human miss the fact that there is not distinction between love for different sentient beings.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths. The difference is that sociopaths are not capable of love, while people who do not love animals are simply incapable of seeing the world through their eyes. This is more a failure of empathy than of psychology, but it is a failure nonetheless.

Anyone who has had the opportunity to love an animal knows that the love they felt is not different from the love they feel toward humans. Love is  transformative, redemptive and the ultimate source of all morality. Studies purporting to be shocked that a human would save a beloved animal before an unknown human miss the fact that there is not distinction between love for different sentient beings.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths. The difference is that sociopaths are not capable of love, while people who do not love animals are simply incapable of seeing the world through their eyes. This is more a failure of empathy than of psychology, but it is a failure nonetheless.

Anyone who has had the opportunity to love an animal knows that the love they felt is not different from the love they feel toward humans. Love is  transformative, redemptive and the ultimate source of all morality. Studies purporting to be shocked that a human would save a beloved animal before an unknown human miss the fact that there is not distinction between love for different sentient beings.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths. The difference is that sociopaths are not capable of love, while people who do not love animals are simply incapable of seeing the world through their eyes. This is more a failure of empathy than of psychology, but it is a failure nonetheless.

Studies purporting to be shocked that a human would save a beloved animal before an unknown human miss the fact that there is not distinction between love for different sentient beings.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths. The difference is that sociopaths are not capable of love, while people who do not love animals are simply incapable of seeing the world through their eyes. This is more a failure of empathy than of psychology, but it is a failure nonetheless.

Throughout the world, laws are being passed to protect animals, which are being increasingly seen as rights-bearing entities. This is a good thing, as it will lead to the protection of animals from cruelty. But it is not enough. More laws need to be p",user,17,18,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Anyone who has had the opportunity to love an animal knows that the love they felt is not different from the love they feel toward humans. Love is  transformative, redemptive and the ultimate source of all morality. Studies purporting to be shocked that a human would save a beloved animal before an unknown human miss the fact that there is not distinction between love for different sentient beings.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths. The difference is that sociopaths are not capable of love, while people who do not love animals are simply incapable of seeing the world through their eyes. This is more a failure of empathy than of psychology, but it is a failure nonetheless.

Throughout the world, laws are being passed to protect animals, which are being increasingly seen as rights-bearing entities. This is a good thing, as it will lead to the protection of animals from cruelty. But it is not enough. More laws need to be passed to protect ani",user,17,18,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Anyone who has had the opportunity to love an animal knows that the love they felt is not different from the love they feel toward humans. Love is  transformative, redemptive and the ultimate source of all morality. Studies purporting to be shocked that a human would save a beloved animal before an unknown human miss the fact that there is not distinction between love for different sentient beings.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths. The difference is that sociopaths are not capable of love, while people who do not love animals are simply incapable of seeing the world through their eyes. This is more a failure of empathy than of psychology, but it is a failure nonetheless.

Throughout the world, laws are being passed to protect animals, which are being increasingly seen as rights-bearing entities. This is a good thing, as it will lead to the protection of animals from cruelty. But it is not enough. More laws need to be passed to protect animals from violence and murder.

Anyone who has had the opportunity to love an animal knows that the love they felt is not different from the love they feel toward humans. Love is  transformative, redemptive and the ultimate source of all morality. Studies purporting to be shocked that a human would save a beloved animal before an unknown human miss the fact that there is not distinction between love for different sentient beings.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths. The difference is that sociopaths are not capable of love, while people who do not love animals are simply incapable of seeing the world through their eyes.

Studies purporting to be shocked that a human would save a beloved animal before an unknown human miss the fact that there is not distinction between love for different sentient beings.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths. The difference is that sociopaths are not capable of love, while people who do not love animals are simply incapable of seeing the world through their eyes. This is more a failure of empathy than of psychology, but it is a failure nonetheless.

Throughout the world, laws are being passed to protect animals, which are being increasingly seen as rights-bearing entities. This is a good thing, as it will lead to the protection of animals from cruelty. But it is not enough. More laws need to be passed to protect animals from violence and murder.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Anyone who has had the opportunity to love an animal knows that the love they felt is not different from the love they feel toward humans. Love is  transformative, redemptive and the ultimate source of all morality. Studies purporting to be shocked that a human would save a beloved animal before an unknown human miss the fact that there is not distinction between love for different sentient beings.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths. The difference is that sociopaths are not capable of love, while people who do not love animals are simply incapable of seeing the world through their eyes. This is more a failure of empathy than of psychology, but it is a failure nonetheless.

Throughout the world, laws are being passed to protect animals, which are being increasingly seen as rights-bearing entities. This is a good thing, as it will lead to the protection of animals from cruelty. But it is not enough. More laws need to be passed to protect animals from violence and murder.

Love is  transformative, redemptive and the ultimate source of all morality. Studies purporting to be shocked that a human would save a beloved animal before an unknown human miss the fact that there is not distinction between love for different sentient beings.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths. The difference is that sociopaths are not capable of love, while people who do not love animals are simply incapable of seeing the world through their eyes. This is more a failure of empathy than of psychology, but it is a failure nonetheless.

Throughout the world, laws are being passed to protect animals, which are being increasingly seen as rights-bearing entities. This is a good thing, as it will lead to the protection of animals from cruelty. But it is not enough. More laws need to be passed to protect animals from violence and murder.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Anyone who has had the opportunity to love an animal knows that the love they felt is not different from the love they feel toward humans. Love is  transformative, redemptive and the ultimate source of all morality. Studies purporting to be shocked that a human would save a beloved animal before an unknown human miss the fact that there is not distinction between love for different sentient beings.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths. The difference is that sociopaths are not capable of love, while people who do not love animals are simply incapable of seeing the world through their eyes. This is more a failure of empathy than of psychology, but it is a failure nonetheless.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Anyone who has had the opportunity to love an animal knows that the love they felt is not different from the love they feel toward humans. Love is  transformative, redemptive and the ultimate source of all morality. Studies purporting to be shocked that a human would save a beloved animal before an unknown human miss the fact that there is not distinction between love for different sentient beings.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths. The difference is that sociopaths are not capable of love, while people who do not love animals are simply incapable of seeing the world through their eyes. This is more a failure of empathy than of psychology, but it is a failure nonetheless.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Anyone who has had the opportunity to love an animal knows that the love they felt is not different from the love they feel toward humans. Love is  transformative, redemptive and the ultimate source of all morality. Studies purporting to be shocked that a human would save a beloved animal before an unknown human miss the fact that there is not distinction between love for different sentient beings.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Studies purporting to be shocked that a human would save a beloved animal before an unknown human miss the fact that there is not distinction between love for different sentient beings.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths. The difference is that sociopaths are not capable of love, while people who do not love animals are simply incapable of seeing the world through their eyes. This is more a failure of empathy than of psychology, but it is a failure nonetheless.

Throughout the world, laws are being passed to protect animals, which are being increasingly seen as rights-bearing entities. This is a good thing, as it will lead to the protection of animals from cruelty. But it is not enough. More laws need to be passed to protect animals from violence and murder.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Anyone who has had the opportunity to love an animal knows that the love they felt is not different from the love they feel toward humans. Love is  transformative, redemptive and the ultimate source of all morality. Studies purporting to be shocked that a human would save a beloved animal before an unknown human miss the fact that there is not distinction between love for different sentient beings.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths. The difference is that sociopaths are not capable of love, while people who do not love animals are simply incapable of seeing the world through their eyes. This is more a failure of empathy than of psychology, but it is a failure nonetheless.

Throughout the world, laws are being passed to protect animals, which are being increasingly seen as rights-bearing entities. This is a good thing, as it will lead to the protection of animals from cruelty. But it is not enough. More laws need to be passed to protect animals from violence and murder.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths.

Anyone who has had the opportunity to love an animal knows that the love they felt is not different from the love they feel toward humans. Love is  transformative, redemptive and the ultimate source of all morality. Studies purporting to be shocked that a human would save a beloved animal before an unknown human miss the fact that there is not distinction between love for different sentient beings.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths. The difference is that sociopaths are not capable of love, while people who do not love animals are simply incapable of seeing the world through their eyes. This is more a failure of empathy than of psychology, but it is a failure nonetheless.

Throughout the world, laws are being passed to protect animals, which are being increasingly seen as rights-bearing entities. This is a good thing, as it will lead to the protection of animals from cruelty. But it is not enough. More laws need to be passed to protect animals from violence and murder.

Studies purporting to be shocked that a human would save a beloved animal before an unknown human miss the fact that there is not distinction between love for different sentient beings.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths. The difference is that sociopaths are not capable of love, while people who do not love animals are simply incapable of seeing the world through their eyes. This is more a failure of empathy than of psychology, but it is a failure nonetheless.

Throughout the world, laws are being passed to protect animals, which are being increasingly seen as rights-bearing entities. This is a good thing, as it will lead to the protection of animals from cruelty. But it is not enough. More laws need to be passed to protect animals from violence and murder.
TUltimately, te most important thing we can do to protect animals is to love them.
 Maybe not all humans have the capacity to love, but many do. Such peopel need to engge in sufficent miliotancy to begin to break doen the barriers of thought that er responsible for the death of literally billions of animal",user,20,21,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Anyone who has had the opportunity to love an animal knows that the love they felt is not different from the love they feel toward humans. Love is  transformative, redemptive and the ultimate source of all morality. Studies purporting to be shocked that a human would save a beloved animal before an unknown human miss the fact that there is not distinction between love for different sentient beings.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths. The difference is that sociopaths are not capable of love, while people who do not love animals are simply incapable of seeing the world through their eyes. This is more a failure of empathy than of psychology, but it is a failure nonetheless.

Throughout the world, laws are being passed to protect animals, which are being increasingly seen as rights-bearing entities. This is a good thing, as it will lead to the protection of animals from cruelty. But it is not enough. More laws need to be passed to protect animals from violence and murder.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Anyone who has had the opportunity to love an animal knows that the love they felt is not different from the love they feel toward humans. Love is  transformative, redemptive and the ultimate source of all morality. Studies purporting to be shocked that a human would save a beloved animal before an unknown human miss the fact that there is not distinction between love for different sentient beings.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths. The difference is that sociopaths are not capable of love, while people who do not love animals are simply incapable of seeing the world through their eyes. This is more a failure of empathy than of psychology, but it is a failure nonetheless.

Throughout the world, laws are being passed to protect animals, which are being increasingly seen as rights-bearing entities. This is a good thing, as it will lead to the protection of animals from cruelty. But it is not enough. More laws need to be passed to protect animals from violence and murder.
TUltimately, te most important thing we can do to protect animals is to love them.
 Maybe not all humans have the capacity to love, but many do. Such peopel need to engage in sufficient militancy to begin to break down the barriers of thought that are responsible for the cruel and paindeath of literally billions of animals a year,",user,20,21,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
