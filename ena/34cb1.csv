In my opinion, there is no such thing as a ""too dangerous"" sport. If you are willing to accept the risks, then you should be allowed to pursue your sport.  You can die at any time, and you can die doing anything. It's just a matter of how much risk you are willing to accept.

 If you want to climb a mountain, then climb it. If you want to jump out of a plane, then jump out of a plane. If you want to race cars, then race cars.
