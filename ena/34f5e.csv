I think that maybe people didn't want you to know because they thought that you would go crazy, or other people would think you are crazy."" 

You ask the bee what does it mean by ""what are your orders"" what can a bee do for you, you think to yourself. The bee responds ""We can do anything you need."" You test the bee, and ask for some honey for your tea. The bee says ""It will be done"" and lifts off the ground, and flies into your cupboard. Soon it returns with a tiny jar of honey.
