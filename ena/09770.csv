In my opinion, stereotypical characters have no place in any story. They betray a deadening lack of imagination and creativity on the part of their creators. A stereotyped character is a kind of lazy short-cut, used by a writer who has no real faith in their own work. I don't like those types of creators, so I typically avoid their work, whether it is in books, games, movies, or television. So, my experience with these kinds of characters is limited.

However, some of the characters I've encountered that made me cringe that readily spring to mind include Harry Potter, Rey from the recent Star Wars films, and Abby from The Last of Us 2. Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first. Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character.

A stereotyped character is a kind of lazy short-cut, used by a writer who has no real faith in their own work. I don't like those types of creators, so I typically avoid their work, whether it is in books, games, movies, or television. So, my experience with these kinds of characters is limited.

However, some of the characters I've encountered that made me cringe that readily spring to mind include Harry Potter, Rey from the recent Star Wars films, and Abby from The Last of Us 2. Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first. Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character.

Abby from The Last of Us was an unmitigated stereotype of an ugly, muscle-bound, violent, 'trans' or lesbian character that was included specifically to appeal to some potentially less-savory segments of the gaming audience, and I found h",user,12,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,12

In my opinion, stereotypical characters have no place in any story. They betray a deadening lack of imagination and creativity on the part of their creators. A stereotyped character is a kind of lazy short-cut, used by a writer who has no real faith in their own work. I don't like those types of creators, so I typically avoid their work, whether it is in books, games, movies, or television. So, my experience with these kinds of characters is limited.

However, some of the characters I've encountered that made me cringe that readily spring to mind include Harry Potter, Rey from the recent Star Wars films, and Abby from The Last of Us 2. Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first. Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character. As a result of Rey, I gave up on the new Star Wars movies entirely.

Abby from The Last of Us was an unmitigated stereotype of an ugly, muscle-bound, violent, 'trans' or lesbian character that was included specifically to appeal to some potentially less-savory segments of the gaming audience, and I found her unbelievably offensive, and stopped playing the game within 15 minutes of having to endure her.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters have no place in any story. They betray a deadening lack of imagination and creativity on the part of their creators. A stereotyped character is a kind of lazy short-cut, used by a writer who has no real faith in their own work. I don't like those types of creators, so I typically avoid their work, whether it is in books, games, movies, or television. So, my experience with these kinds of characters is limited.

However, some of the characters I've encountered that made me cringe that readily spring to mind include Harry Potter, Rey from the recent Star Wars films, and Abby from The Last of Us 2. Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first. Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character.

However, some of the characters I've encountered that made me cringe that readily spring to mind include Harry Potter, Rey from the recent Star Wars films, and Abby from The Last of Us 2. Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first. Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character. As a result of Rey, I gave up on the new Star Wars movies entirely.

Abby from The Last of Us was an unmitigated stereotype of an ugly, muscle-bound, violent, 'trans' or lesbian character that was included specifically to appeal to some potentially less-savory segments of the gaming audience, and I found her unbelievably offensive, and stopped playing the game within 15 minutes of having to endure her.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters have no place in any story. They betray a deadening lack of imagination and creativity on the part of their creators. A stereotyped character is a kind of lazy short-cut, used by a writer who has no real faith in their own work. I don't like those types of creators, so I typically avoid their work, whether it is in books, games, movies, or television. So, my experience with these kinds of characters is limited.

However, some of the characters I've encountered that made me cringe that readily spring to mind include Harry Potter, Rey from the recent Star Wars films, and Abby from The Last of Us 2. Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first. Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character. As a result of Rey, I gave up on the new Star Wars movies entirely.

Abby from The Last of Us was an unmitigated stereotype of an ugly, muscle-bound, violent, 'trans' or lesbian character that was included specifically to appeal to some potentially less-savory segments of the gaming audience, and I found her unbelievably offensive, and stopped playing the game within 15 minutes of having to endure her.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters have no place in any story. They betray a deadening lack of imagination and creativity on the part of their creators. A stereotyped character is a kind of lazy short-cut, used by a writer who has no real faith in their own work. I don't like those types of creators, so I typically avoid their work, whether it is in books, games, movies, or television. So, my experience with these kinds of characters is limited.

However, some of the characters I've encountered that made me cringe that readily spring to mind include Harry Potter, Rey from the recent Star Wars films, and Abby from The Last of Us 2. Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first. Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character. As a result of Rey, I gave up on the new Star Wars movies entirely.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters have no place in any story. They betray a deadening lack of imagination and creativity on the part of their creators. A stereotyped character is a kind of lazy short-cut, used by a writer who has no real faith in their own work. I don't like those types of creators, so I typically avoid their work, whether it is in books, games, movies, or television. So, my experience with these kinds of characters is limited.

However, some of the characters I've encountered that made me cringe that readily spring to mind include Harry Potter, Rey from the recent Star Wars films, and Abby from The Last of Us 2. Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first. Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character.

Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first. Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character. As a result of Rey, I gave up on the new Star Wars movies entirely.

Abby from The Last of Us was an unmitigated stereotype of an ugly, muscle-bound, violent, 'trans' or lesbian character that was included specifically to appeal to some potentially less-savory segments of the gaming audience, and I found her unbelievably offensive, and stopped playing the game within 15 minutes of having to endure her.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypical characters have no place in any story. They betray a deadening lack of imagination and creativity on the part of their creators. A stereotyped character is a kind of lazy short-cut, used by a writer who has no real faith in their own work. I don't like those types of creators, so I typically avoid their work, whether it is in books, games, movies, or television. So, my experience with these kinds of characters is limited.

However, some of the characters I've encountered that made me cringe that readily spring to mind include Harry Potter, Rey from the recent Star Wars films, and Abby from The Last of Us 2. Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first. Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character. As a result of Rey, I gave up on the new Star Wars movies entirely.

Abby from The Last of Us was an unmitigated stereotype of an ugly, muscle-bound, violent, 'trans' or lesbian character that was included specifically to appeal to some potentially less-savory segments of the gaming audience, and I found her unbelievably offensive, and stopped playing the game within 15 minutes of having to endure her.

Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first. Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character. As a result of Rey, I gave up on the new Star Wars movies entirely.

Abby from The Last of Us was an unmitigated stereotype of an ugly, muscle-bound, violent, 'trans' or lesbian character that was included specifically to appeal to some potentially less-savory segments of the gaming audience, and I found her unbelievably offensive, and stopped playing the game within 15 minutes of having to endure her.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters have no place in any story. They betray a deadening lack of imagination and creativity on the part of their creators.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypical characters have no place in any story. They betray a deadening lack of imagination and creativity on the part of their creators. A stereotyped character is a kind of lazy short-cut, used by a writer who has no real faith in their own work. I don't like those types of creators, so I typically avoid their work, whether it is in books, games, movies, or television. So, my experience with these kinds of characters is limited.

However, some of the characters I've encountered that made me cringe that readily spring to mind include Harry Potter, Rey from the recent Star Wars films, and Abby from The Last of Us 2. Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first. Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character. As a result of Rey, I gave up on the new Star Wars movies entirely.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypical characters have no place in any story. They betray a deadening lack of imagination and creativity on the part of their creators. A stereotyped character is a kind of lazy short-cut, used by a writer who has no real faith in their own work. I don't like those types of creators, so I typically avoid their work, whether it is in books, games, movies, or television. So, my experience with these kinds of characters is limited.

However, some of the characters I've encountered that made me cringe that readily spring to mind include Harry Potter, Rey from the recent Star Wars films, and Abby from The Last of Us 2. Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first. Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character. As a result of Rey, I gave up on the new Star Wars movies entirely.

I don't like those types of creators, so I typically avoid their work, whether it is in books, games, movies, or television. So, my experience with these kinds of characters is limited.

Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character. As a result of Rey, I gave up on the new Star Wars movies entirely.

Abby from The Last of Us was an unmitigated stereotype of an ugly, muscle-bound, violent, 'trans' or lesbian character that was included specifically to appeal to some potentially less-savory segments of the gaming audience, and I found her unbelievably offensive, and stopped playing the game within 15 minutes of having to endure her.

There are many older stereotypes in all media, of course.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters have no place in any story. They betray a deadening lack of imagination and creativity on the part of their creators. A stereotyped character is a kind of lazy short-cut, used by a writer who has no real faith in their own work. I don't like those types of creators, so I typically avoid their work, whether it is in books, games, movies, or television. So, my experience with these kinds of characters is limited.

A stereotyped character is a kind of lazy short-cut, used by a writer who has no real faith in their own work. I don't like those types of creators, so I typically avoid their work, whether it is in books, games, movies, or television. So, my experience with these kinds of characters is limited.

However, some of the characters I've encountered that made me cringe that readily spring to mind include Harry Potter, Rey from the recent Star Wars films, and Abby from The Last of Us 2. Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first. Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character. As a result of Rey, I gave up on the new Star Wars movies entirely.

Abby from The Last of Us was an unmitigated stereotype of an ugly, muscle-bound, violent, 'trans' or lesbian character that was included specifically to appeal to some potentially less-savory segments of the gaming audience, and I found her unbelievably offensive, and stopped playing the game within 15 minutes of having to endure her.

There are many older stereotypes in all media, of course. But I guess the point I'm trying to make, is that there isn't any special quality about stereotypes, they're just examples of poor writing, laziness and creative bankruptcy, and the stories that feature them are bad, and not worth watching.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypical characters have no place in any story. They betray a deadening lack of imagination and creativity on the part of their creators. A stereotyped character is a kind of lazy short-cut, used by a writer who has no real faith in their own work. I don't like those types of creators, so I typically avoid their work, whether it is in books, games, movies, or television. So, my experience with these kinds of characters is limited.

However, some of the characters I've encountered that made me cringe that readily spring to mind include Harry Potter, Rey from the recent Star Wars films, and Abby from The Last of Us 2. Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first. Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character. As a result of Rey, I gave up on the new Star Wars movies entirely.

Abby from The Last of Us was an unmitigated stereotype of an ugly, muscle-bound, violent, 'trans' or lesbian character that was included specifically to appeal to some potentially less-savory segments of the gaming audience, and I found her unbelievably offensive, and stopped playing the game within 15 minutes of having to endure her.

Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first. Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character. As a result of Rey, I gave up on the new Star Wars movies entirely.

Abby from The Last of Us was an unmitigated stereotype of an ugly, muscle-bound, violent, 'trans' or lesbian character that was included specifically to appeal to some potentially less-savory segments of the gaming audience, and I found her unbelievably offensive, and stopped playing the game within 15 minutes of having to endure her.

There are many older stereotypes in all media, of course. But I guess the point I'm trying to make, is that there isn't any special quality about stereotypes, they're just examples of poor writing, laziness and creative bankruptcy, and the stories that feature them are bad, and not worth watching.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters have no place in any story. They betray a deadening lack of imagination and creativity on the part of their creators. A stereotyped character is a kind of lazy short-cut, used by a writer who has no real faith in their own work. I don't like those types of creators, so I typically avoid their work, whether it is in books, games, movies, or television. So, my experience with these kinds of characters is limited.

However, some of the characters I've encountered that made me cringe that readily spring to mind include Harry Potter, Rey from the recent Star Wars films, and Abby from The Last of Us 2. Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first. Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character. As a result of Rey, I gave up on the new Star Wars movies entirely.

A stereotyped character is a kind of lazy short-cut, used by a writer who has no real faith in their own work. I don't like those types of creators, so I typically avoid their work, whether it is in books, games, movies, or television. So, my experience with these kinds of characters is limited.

However, some of the characters I've encountered that made me cringe that readily spring to mind include Harry Potter, Rey from the recent Star Wars films, and Abby from The Last of Us 2. Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first. Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character. As a result of Rey, I gave up on the new Star Wars movies entirely.

Abby from The Last of Us was an unmitigated stereotype of an ugly, muscle-bound, violent, 'trans' or lesbian character that was included specifically to appeal to some potentially less-savory segments of the gaming audience, and I found her unbelievably offensive, and stopped playing the game within 15 minutes of having to endure her.

There are many older stereotypes in all media, of course. But I guess the point I'm trying to make, is that there isn't any special quality about stereotypes, they're just examples of poor writing, laziness and creative bankruptcy, and the stories that feature them are bad, and not worth watching.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypical characters have no place in any story. They betray a deadening lack of imagination and creativity on the part of their creators. A stereotyped character is a kind of lazy short-cut, used by a writer who has no real faith in their own work. I don't like those types of creators, so I typically avoid their work, whether it is in books, games, movies, or television. So, my experience with these kinds of characters is limited.

However, some of the characters I've encountered that made me cringe that readily spring to mind include Harry Potter, Rey from the recent Star Wars films, and Abby from The Last of Us 2. Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first. Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character. As a result of Rey, I gave up on the new Star Wars movies entirely.

Abby from The Last of Us was an unmitigated stereotype of an ugly, muscle-bound, violent, 'trans' or lesbian character that was included specifically to appeal to some potentially less-savory segments of the gaming audience, and I found her unbelievably offensive, and stopped playing the game within 15 minutes of having to endure her.

A stereotyped character is a kind of lazy short-cut, used by a writer who has no real faith in their own work. I don't like those types of creators, so I typically avoid their work, whether it is in books, games, movies, or television. So, my experience with these kinds of characters is limited.

However, some of the characters I've encountered that made me cringe that readily spring to mind include Harry Potter, Rey from the recent Star Wars films, and Abby from The Last of Us 2. Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first. Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character. As a result of Rey, I gave up on the new Star Wars movies entirely.

Abby from The Last of Us was an unmitigated stereotype of an ugly, muscle-bound, violent, 'trans' or lesbian character that was included specifically to appeal to some potentially less-savory segments of the gaming audience, and I found her unbelievably offensive, and stopped playing the game within 15 minutes of having to endure her.

There are many older stereotypes in all media, of course. But I guess the point I'm trying to make, is that there isn't any special quality about stereotypes, they're just examples of poor writing, laziness and creative bankruptcy, and the stories that feature them are bad, and not worth watching.

Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first. Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character. As a result of Rey, I gave up on the new Star Wars movies entirely.

Abby from The Last of Us was an unmitigated stereotype of an ugly, muscle-bound, violent, 'trans' or lesbian character that was included specifically to appeal to some potentially less-savory segments of the gaming audience, and I found her unbelievably offensive, and stopped playing the game within 15 minutes of having to endure her.

However, some of the characters I've encountered that made me cringe that readily spring to mind include Harry Potter, Rey from the recent Star Wars films, and Abby from The Last of Us 2. Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first.
