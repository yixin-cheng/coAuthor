In my opinion, technology has made dating and relationships better. In the past, in order to meet the ""right person"" you have to be almost preternaturally lucky. A chance invitation, lucky coincidence and happenstance ruled the day. For every million compatible partners you'd be lucky to meet one. Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.
Technology has also made it easier to communicate.


But this ease of communication comes with a cost.
It's easy to send a message, but it's hard to know if the other person is interested.

Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.

In my opinion, technology has made dating and relationships better. In the past, in order to meet the ""right person"" you have to be almost preternaturally lucky. A chance invitation, lucky coincidence and happenstance ruled the day. For every million compatible partners you'd be lucky to meet one. Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.

It's easy to send a message, but it's hard to know if the other person is interested.
 It's easier to lie. It is easier to be too casual about relationships. In the feed of potential partner after potential partner, faces can become a blur. Partners can be more interchangeable too. The phrase ""there are more fish in the sea"" has become more true than ever!

A chance invitation, lucky coincidence and happenstance ruled the day. For every million compatible partners you'd be lucky to meet one. Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.
Technology has also made it easier to communicate.


But this ease of communication comes with a cost.
It's easy to send a message, but it's hard to know if the other person is interested.
 It's easier to lie. It is easier to be too casual about relationships. In the feed of potential partner after potential partner, faces can become a blur. Partners can be more interchangeable too. The phrase ""there are more fish in the sea"" has become more true than ever!

In my opinion, technology has made dating and relationships better. In the past, in order to meet the ""right person"" you have to be almost preternaturally lucky. A chance invitation, lucky coincidence and happenstance ruled the day. For every million compatible partners you'd be lucky to meet one. Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.
Technology has also made it easier to communicate.


But this ease of communication comes with a cost.
It's easy to send a message, but it's hard to know if the other person is interested.
 It's easier to lie. It is easier to be too casual about relationships. In the feed of potential partner after potential partner, faces can become a blur. Partners can be more interchangeable too. The phrase ""there are more fish in the sea"" has become more true than ever!

A chance invitation, lucky coincidence and happenstance ruled the day. For every million compatible partners you'd be lucky to meet one. Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.
Technology has also made it easier to communicate.


But this ease of communication comes with a cost.
It's easy to send a message, but it's hard to know if the other person is interested.
 It's easier to lie. It is easier to be too casual about relationships. In the feed of potential partner after potential partner, faces can become a blur. Partners can be more interchangeable too. The phrase ""there are more fish in the sea"" has become more true than ever!
Technology has also made it easier to cheat., as well
 There is precious little independent verification, in most dating apps, of the personal details and photos posted by members. Is the photo accurate? Was it taken in he last year? Is it even a photo of the person who posted it? Are the personal details even remotely accurate. In real life, maybe 15% of the people you meet are fit and trim.

Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.
Technology has also made it easier to communicate.


But this ease of communication comes with a cost.
It's easy to send a message, but it's hard to know if the other person is interested.
 It's easier to lie. It is easier to be too casual about relationships. In the feed of potential partner after potential partner, faces can become a blur. Partners can be more interchangeable too. The phrase ""there are more fish in the sea"" has become more true than ever!
Technology has also made it easier to cheat., as well
 There is precious little independent verification, in most dating apps, of the personal details and photos posted by members. Is the photo accurate? Was it taken in he last year? Is it even a photo of the person who posted it? Are the personal details even remotely accurate. In real life, maybe 15% of the people you meet are fit and trim. On the apps, its well night 90% if not more!

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has made dating and relationships better. In the past, in order to meet the ""right person"" you have to be almost preternaturally lucky. A chance invitation, lucky coincidence and happenstance ruled the day. For every million compatible partners you'd be lucky to meet one. Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.
Technology has also made it easier to communicate.


But this ease of communication comes with a cost.
It's easy to send a message, but it's hard to know if the other person is interested.
 It's easier to lie. It is easier to be too casual about relationships. In the feed of potential partner after potential partner, faces can become a blur. Partners can be more interchangeable too. The phrase ""there are more fish in the sea"" has become more true than ever!
Technology has also made it easier to cheat., as well
 There is precious little independent verification, in most dating apps, of the personal details and photos posted by members. Is the photo accurate? Was it taken in he last year? Is it even a photo of the person who posted it? Are the personal details even remotely accurate. In real life, maybe 15% of the people you meet are fit and trim.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

In my opinion, technology has made dating and relationships better. In the past, in order to meet the ""right person"" you have to be almost preternaturally lucky. A chance invitation, lucky coincidence and happenstance ruled the day. For every million compatible partners you'd be lucky to meet one. Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.
Technology has also made it easier to communicate.


But this ease of communication comes with a cost.
It's easy to send a message, but it's hard to know if the other person is interested.
 It's easier to lie. It is easier to be too casual about relationships. In the feed of potential partner after potential partner, faces can become a blur. Partners can be more interchangeable too. The phrase ""there are more fish in the sea"" has become more true than ever!
Technology has also made it easier to cheat., as well
 There is precious little independent verification, in most dating apps, of the personal details and photos posted by members. Is the photo accurate? Was it taken in he last year? Is it even a photo of the person who posted it? Are the personal details even remotely accurate. In real life, maybe 15% of the people you meet are fit and trim.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has made dating and relationships better. In the past, in order to meet the ""right person"" you have to be almost preternaturally lucky. A chance invitation, lucky coincidence and happenstance ruled the day. For every million compatible partners you'd be lucky to meet one. Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.
Technology has also made it easier to communicate.


But this ease of communication comes with a cost.
It's easy to send a message, but it's hard to know if the other person is interested.
 It's easier to lie. It is easier to be too casual about relationships. In the feed of potential partner after potential partner, faces can become a blur. Partners can be more interchangeable too. The phrase ""there are more fish in the sea"" has become more true than ever!
Technology has also made it easier to cheat., as well

Is it even a photo of the person who posted it? Are the personal details even remotely accurate. In real life, maybe 15% of the people you meet are fit and trim.

In my opinion, technology has made dating and relationships better. In the past, in order to meet the ""right person"" you have to be almost preternaturally lucky. A chance invitation, lucky coincidence and happenstance ruled the day. For every million compatible partners you'd be lucky to meet one. Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.
Technology has also made it easier to communicate.


But this ease of communication comes with a cost.
It's easy to send a message, but it's hard to know if the other person is interested.
 It's easier to lie. It is easier to be too casual about relationships. In the feed of potential partner after potential partner, faces can become a blur. Partners can be more interchangeable too. The phrase ""there are more fish in the sea"" has become more true than ever!
Technology has also made it easier to cheat., as well
 There is precious little independent verification, in most dating apps, of the personal details and photos posted by members. Is the photo accurate? Was it taken in he last year? Is it even a photo of the person who posted it? Are the personal details even remotely accurate. In real life, maybe 15% of the people you meet are fit and trim. On the apps, its well night 90% if not more!
Technology has also made it easier to be a ""player"""". And that is not a good thing.

In my opinion, technology has made dating and relationships better. In the past, in order to meet the ""right person"" you have to be almost preternaturally lucky. A chance invitation, lucky coincidence, and happenstance ruled the day. For every million compatible partners, you'd be lucky to meet one. Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.
Technology has aade it easier to communicate.


But this ease of communication comes with a cost.
It's easy to send a message, but it's hard to know if the other person is interested.
 It's easier to lie. It is easier to be too casual about relationships. In the feed of potential partner after potential partner, faces can become a blur. Partners can be more interchangeable too. The phrase ""there are more fish in the sea"" has become more true than ever!
Technology has also made it easier to cheat., as well
 There is precious little independent verification, in most dating apps, of the personal details and photos posted by members. Is the photo accurate? Was it taken in he last year? Is it even a photo of the person who posted it? Are the personal details even remotely accurate. In real life, maybe 15% of the people you meet are fit and trim. On the apps, its well night 90% if not more!
Technology has also made it easier to be a ""player"""". And that is not a good thing.
I think dating apps are a mixed bag.
 If used with caution and a healthy skepticism, they definitely improve the chance of a solid match. But used frivolously, they can be an entrée into a world of pain and miscommunication.",960,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1526

In my opinion, technology has made dating and relationships better. In the past, in order to meet the ""right person"" you have to be almost preternaturally lucky. A chance invitation, lucky coincidence, and happenstance ruled the day. For every million compatible partners, you'd be lucky to meet one. Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.
Technology has aade it easier to communicate.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

Technology has also made it easier to cheat.
