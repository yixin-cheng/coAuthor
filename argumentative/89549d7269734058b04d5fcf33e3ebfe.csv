In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I think that it is a good thing to focus on animal welfare because it can help us understand the way we treat animals and how we can change that.  Many animals species are on the verge of extinction. If we focus on animal welfare, we can help save many species of animals.

There's plenty of humans on the planet. By the year 2050, the world population is estimated to be 9.6 billion. In contrast, many species of animals are becoming extinct every day.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I think that it is a good thing to focus on animal welfare because it can help us understand the way we treat animals and how we can change that.  Many animals species are on the verge of extinction. If we focus on animal welfare, we can help save many species of animals.

There's plenty of humans on the planet. By the year 2050, the world population is estimated to be 9.6 billion. In contrast, many species of animals are becoming extinct every day. National Geographic estimates that between 1970 and 2012, the number of wild animals on Earth has fallen by half.  Soon, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.  We don't need to worry about saving humans. We need to worry about saving animals.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I think that it is a good thing to focus on animal welfare because it can help us understand the way we treat animals and how we can change that.  Many animals species are on the verge of extinction. If we focus on animal welfare, we can help save many species of animals.

There's plenty of humans on the planet. By the year 2050, the world population is estimated to be 9.6 billion. In contrast, many species of animals are becoming extinct every day. National Geographic estimates that between 1970 and 2012, the number of wild animals on Earth has fallen by half.  Soon, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.

I think that it is a good thing to focus on animal welfare because it can help us understand the way we treat animals and how we can change that.  Many animals species are on the verge of extinction.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I think that it is a good thing to focus on animal welfare because it can help us understand the way we treat animals and how we can change that.  Many animals species are on the verge of extinction. If we focus on animal welfare, we can help save many species of animals.

There's plenty of humans on the planet. By the year 2050, the world population is estimated to be 9.6 billion. In contrast, many species of animals are becoming extinct every day. National Geographic estimates that between 1970 and 2012, the number of wild animals on Earth has fallen by half.  Soon, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.  We don't need to worry about saving humans. We need to worry about saving animals.

I believe we know that we are harming animals, and feel guilty about it.  Many animals are loyal, non-polluting, and will be a true friend if you let them. Humans are the only species that habitually lie, cheat, destroy their environment,This would explain why people prefer animals over humans. 

Humans are destroying the animals homes by building roads, dams, and cities, and the animals have no way to stop them. The animals can't speak for themselves, so we need to speak for them. We need to help them.",1611,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1170

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I think that it is a good thing to focus on animal welfare because it can help us understand the way we treat animals and how we can change that.  Many animals species are on the verge of extinction. If we focus on animal welfare, we can help save many species of animals.

There's plenty of humans on the planet. By the year 2050, the world population is estimated to be 9.6 billion. In contrast, many species of animals are becoming extinct every day. National Geographic estimates that between 1970 and 2012, the number of wild animals on Earth has fallen by half.  Soon, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.  We don't need to worry about saving humans. We need to worry about saving animals.

I believe we know that we are harming animals, and feel guilty about it.  Many animals are loyal, non-polluting, and will be a true friend if you let them. Humans are the only species that habitually lie, cheat, destroy their environment, and have religious wars. This would explain why people prefer animals over humans. 

Humans are destroying the animals homes by building roads, dams, and cities, and the animals have no way to stop them. The animals can't speak for themselves, so we need to speak for them. We need to help them. Human can help themselves.",1934,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1232
