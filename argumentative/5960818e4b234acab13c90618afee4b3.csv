The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should get over it and embrace the benefits of technological communication, work. and learning. The pandemic has made me acutely aware of how contagious all of us are. Every year a flu virus runs rampant in society because people do not socially distant themselves or use sanitary behaviors to prevent the spread of sickness. We need to be able to write our own story and engage face to face in accord with our own individual preferences.

What would it look like, to have people choose how to work and play? Everyone will have the freedom to engage in the way they want and believe it is best for them.  Technology allows people to work and learn and commuincate digitally if they so decide so there is no reason to stop anyone from opting out of in-person presence. People will be happier. People will adapt to the now flexibility. 

Personally, I would use caution when in person. I would want to still spend time with my family and a few friends. And I would love to just work from home and have delivered any items I need.  I do not need the gym, the library, the coffee shop, the workplace, the classroom, or the retail establishments. I did/do not miss them.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should get over it and embrace the benefits of technological communication, work. and learning. The pandemic has made me acutely aware of how contagious all of us are. Every year a flu virus runs rampant in society because people do not socially distant themselves or use sanitary behaviors to prevent the spread of sickness. We need to be able to write our own story and engage face to face in accord with our own individual preferences.

What would it look like, to have people choose how to work and play? Everyone will have the freedom to engage in the way they want and believe it is best for them.  Technology allows people to work and learn and commuincate digitally if they so decide so there is no reason to stop anyone from opting out of in-person presence. People will be happier. People will adapt to the now flexibility. 

Personally, I would use caution when in person. I would want to still spend time with my family and a few friends. And I would love to just work from home and have delivered any items I need.  I do not need the gym, the library, the coffee shop, the workplace, the classroom, or the retail establishments. I did/do not miss them.

Every year a flu virus runs rampant in society because people do not socially distant themselves or use sanitary behaviors to prevent the spread of sickness. We need to be able to write our own story and engage face to face in accord with our own individual preferences.

What would it look like, to have people choose how to work and play? Everyone will have the freedom to engage in the way they want and believe it is best for them.  Technology allows people to work and learn and commuincate digitally if they so decide so there is no reason to stop anyone from opting out of in-person presence. People will be happier. People will adapt to the now flexibility.

In my opinion, we should get over it and embrace the benefits of technological communication, work. and learning. The pandemic has made me acutely aware of how contagious all of us are.

People will adapt to the now flexibility.

In my opinion, we should get over it and embrace the benefits of technological communication, work. and learning. The pandemic has made me acutely aware of how contagious all of us are.

People will adapt to the now flexibility.
