In my opinion, college athletes should be paid by anyone that wants to pay them. It's a free country.  Anyone that wants to give them money has the right to do so.   It's not like they are getting paid by the school. That would definitely be an unethical act. But if the money is from an outside source or sponsor, then it's not a problem. I think anyone that gets paid in college is lucky. They are getting paid to play a sport. They could use the money to pay for their tuition and college expenses.  They could use the money to secure housing and set up their future. I can see why some people are against college athletes getting paid. They are afraid that the college athletes will get greedy and want more money. Also, they are afraid that the college athletes will be distracted from their studies.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid by anyone that wants to pay them. It's a free country.  Anyone that wants to give them money has the right to do so.   It's not like they are getting paid by the school. That would definitely be an unethical act. But if the money is from an outside source or sponsor, then it's not a problem. I think anyone that gets paid in college is lucky. They are getting paid to play a sport. They could use the money to pay for their tuition and college expenses.  They could use the money to secure housing and set up their future. I can see why some people are against college athletes getting paid.

It's not like they are getting paid by the school. That would definitely be an unethical act. But if the money is from an outside source or sponsor, then it's not a problem. I think anyone that gets paid in college is lucky. They are getting paid to play a sport. They could use the money to pay for their tuition and college expenses.  They could use the money to secure housing and set up their future. I can see why some people are against college athletes getting paid. They are afraid that the college athletes will get greedy and want more money. Also, they are afraid that the college athletes will be distracted from their studies.
