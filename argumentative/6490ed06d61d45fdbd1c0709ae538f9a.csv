Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, I do not think it is selfish at all to pursue extreme sports like mountain climbing at all. That is because I feel that a person should be able to pursue whatever it is they like, as long as they’re not hurting anyone else in the process.

Most extreme sports also have that sense of teamwork and comraderies as well. For example , when people do mountain climbing, they usually help one another, and if one of them falls, then the others will do whatever they can to save that person. I'm not a mountain climber, but I know that they basically all tie themselves to a rope to one another for safety. Look at all the teams the climb mount Everest, they go as a team, in an extreme environment, and work together as a team for the safety of each other.

In my opinion, I do not think it is selfish at all to pursue extreme sports like mountain climbing at all. That is because I feel that a person should be able to pursue whatever it is they like, as long as they’re not hurting anyone else in the process.

In my opinion, I do not think it is selfish at all to pursue extreme sports like mountain climbing at all. That is because I feel that a person should be able to pursue whatever it is they like, as long as they’re not hurting anyone else in the process.

Most extreme sports also have that sense of teamwork and comraderies as well. For example , when people do mountain climbing, they usually help one another, and if one of them falls, then the others will do whatever they can to save that person. I'm not a mountain climber, but I know that they basically all tie themselves to a rope to one another for safety. Look at all the teams the climb mount Everest, they go as a team, in an extreme environment, and work together as a team for the safety of each other.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, I do not think it is selfish at all to pursue extreme sports like mountain climbing at all. That is because I feel that a person should be able to pursue whatever it is they like, as long as they’re not hurting anyone else in the process.

I'm not a mountain climber, but I know that they basically all tie themselves to a rope to one another for safety. Look at all the teams the climb mount Everest, they go as a team, in an extreme environment, and work together as a team for the safety of each other.
