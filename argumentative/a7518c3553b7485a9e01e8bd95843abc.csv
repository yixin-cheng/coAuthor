What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there are many stereotypical characters in pop culture. You often will have stereotypical African Americans and homosexuals. In general it does not come down to if a character is stereotypical for me. It really comes down to if the show, book or movie surrounding the character is good. One example is modern family. It has a very stereotypical view of homosexuals but I like many other aspects of the show so it's okay.
I do not think I would ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone.
 Sometimes stereotypes are needed for specific types of comedies. A show like Reno 911 is a good example. The people on their are all stereotypes but it's done in order to make fun of the worst sides of humanity. I think with humor that it is more acceptable because there is a reason for it. In something such as a drama it wouldn't make as much sense.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there are many stereotypical characters in pop culture. You often will have stereotypical African Americans and homosexuals. In general it does not come down to if a character is stereotypical for me. It really comes down to if the show, book or movie surrounding the character is good. One example is modern family. It has a very stereotypical view of homosexuals but I like many other aspects of the show so it's okay.
I do not think I would ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone.
 Sometimes stereotypes are needed for specific types of comedies. A show like Reno 911 is a good example. The people on their are all stereotypes but it's done in order to make fun of the worst sides of humanity. I think with humor that it is more acceptable because there is a reason for it. In something such as a drama it wouldn't make as much sense.

What is the Most Offensive Stereotype You've Seen in a Book or Movie?
 I can't think of one that has personally offended me to such an extent that it really stuck with me. I know they exist, especially in the past. That brings us to another topic, the fact that stereotypes are starting to vanish when it comes to entertainment. More well defined characters are now being created. 

Stereotypes in entertainment have existed for a long time, but that will soon be a thing of the past due to changing times. I don't know if this will even be an issue in the future. I think that it will be a thing of the past. It may end up hurting certain things like comedy shows but it is just how things change with time. Maybe in the near future we won't even be discussing this topic of stereotypical characters anymor",1937,[],1,1,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1965

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there are many stereotypical characters in pop culture. You often will have stereotypical African Americans and homosexuals. In general it does not come down to if a character is stereotypical for me. It really comes down to if the show, book or movie surrounding the character is good. One example is modern family. It has a very stereotypical view of homosexuals but I like many other aspects of the show so it's okay.
I do not think I would ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone.
 Sometimes stereotypes are needed for specific types of comedies. A show like Reno 911 is a good example. The people on their are all stereotypes but it's done in order to make fun of the worst sides of humanity. I think with humor that it is more acceptable because there is a reason for it. In something such as a drama it wouldn't make as much sense.
