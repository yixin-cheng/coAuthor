In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college?

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college?

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on?

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place.

They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on?

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases.

They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on?

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on?

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on?

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans.

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues paying them would bri The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases. 

Athletes already have every advantage given to them. Lets choose not to ruin the foundations of college just to give them even more power. We have to think of everyone, especially the often forgotten artists of this world. ",1283,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1737

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues paying them would bring up. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place.

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on?

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans.
