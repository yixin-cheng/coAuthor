The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the reasoning that existed before the pandemic should still apply. Namely that screen time should be monitored, and that limiting your screen time is best for both mental and physical health. 
The science shows that too much screen time contributes to obesity, diabetes and hypertension.
 It can cause eye strain, disrupt your mental state, and alter your sleep patterns. That last one is very important, as uninterrupted sleep is an absolute requirement for fighting viruses and to speed up our healing responses. If there is one good thing that has come out of the pandemic it is increased awareness of health, and a new focus on maintaining and improving health. Limiting screen time is an important part of this. 

This is not to say that we should give up on screen altogether. They are an important tool for work efficiency, social connection, and overall entertainment. The main point is a balance must be found.
Do you think you're spending too much time on your screen?

Exploring other alternatives in cases where screen related activities have taken over can help you learn where screens are essential to you, and where you could give them up (or use them less) for alternatives.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the reasoning that existed before the pandemic should still apply. Namely that screen time should be monitored, and that limiting your screen time is best for both mental and physical health. 
The science shows that too much screen time contributes to obesity, diabetes and hypertension.
 It can cause eye strain, disrupt your mental state, and alter your sleep patterns. That last one is very important, as uninterrupted sleep is an absolute requirement for fighting viruses and to speed up our healing responses. If there is one good thing that has come out of the pandemic it is increased awareness of health, and a new focus on maintaining and improving health. Limiting screen time is an important part of this. 

This is not to say that we should give up on screen altogether. They are an important tool for work efficiency, social connection, and overall entertainment. The main point is a balance must be found.
Do you think you're spending too much time on your screen?
 Then you probably are. Like anything else, technology can become excessive and unhealthy if not properly moderated. Exploring other alternatives in cases where screen related activities have taken over can help you learn where screens are essential to you, and where you could give them up (or use them less) for alternatives.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

 It can cause eye strain, disrupt your mental state, and alter your sleep patterns. That last one is very important, as uninterrupted sleep is an absolute requirement for fighting viruses and to speed up our healing responses. If there is one good thing that has come out of the pandemic it is increased awareness of health, and a new focus on maintaining and improving health. Limiting screen time is an important part of this.

Exploring other alternatives in cases where screen related activities have taken over can help you learn where screens are essential to you, and where you could give them up (or use them less) for alternatives.

The science shows that too much screen time contributes to obesity, diabetes and hypertension.
 It can cause eye strain, disrupt your mental state, and alter your sleep patterns. That last one is very important, as uninterrupted sleep is an absolute requirement for fighting viruses and to speed up our healing responses. If there is one good thing that has come out of the pandemic it is increased awareness of health, and a new focus on maintaining and improving health. Limiting screen time is an important part of this. 

This is not to say that we should give up on screen altogether. They are an important tool for work efficiency, social connection, and overall entertainment. The main point is a balance must be found.

Exploring other alternatives in cases where screen related activities have taken over can help you learn where screens are essential to you, and where you could give them up (or use them less) for alternatives. 

In short, studies have shown that screen titreat screen time like you would anything else that can affect you health.
