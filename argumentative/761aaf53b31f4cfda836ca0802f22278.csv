Usually the African American/Token black guy is a basic, one sided character with a few funny catch phrases. Usually nothing more from my experience. I really started to notice it toward the end of high school and then it became a known thing in college. It was something we were all aware of, realized it was probably not right but still perpetuated it out of habit.

If we do that will eventually spill over into the real world. ",1567,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1735
