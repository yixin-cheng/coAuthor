Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

There are movements to ban the 'ownership' of pets.  There are movements to grant animals 'rights'.  It is not surprising someone would choose their pet over a stranger because that pet is part of a family unit and a human stranger is not.

There are movements to ban the 'ownership' of pets.  There are movements to grant animals 'rights'.  It is not surprising someone would choose their pet over a stranger because that pet is part of a family unit and a human stranger is not.

There are movements to ban the 'ownership' of pets.  There are movements to grant animals 'rights'.  It is not surprising someone would choose their pet over a stranger because that pet is part of a family unit and a human stranger is not.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is human nature to care more about the welfare of something helpless than something we perceive as being capable.  Human beings will almost always help a child before an adult due to that instinct.  We perceive animals in the same light, helpless and innocent.

There are movements to ban the 'ownership' of pets.  There are movements to grant animals 'rights'.  It is not surprising someone would choose their pet over a stranger because that pet is part of a family unit and a human stranger is not.

There are movements to ban the 'ownership' of pets.  There are movements to grant animals 'rights'.  It is not surprising someone would choose their pet over a stranger because that pet is part of a family unit and a human stranger is not.

There are movements to ban the 'ownership' of pets.  There are movements to grant animals 'rights'.

In my opinion, it is human nature to care more about the welfare of something helpless than something we perceive as being capable.  Human beings will almost always help a child before an adult due to that instinct.  We perceive animals in the same light, helpless and innocent.

Is it right?  That is a question that the 'animal movement' says a resounding 'yes' to.  There is a huge movement to wean us from eating animal products.  There are movements to ban the 'ownership' of pets.  There are movements to grant animals 'rights'.  It is not surprising someone would choose their pet over a stranger because that pet is part of a family unit and a human stranger is not.

In my opinion, it is human nature to care more about the welfare of something helpless than something we perceive as being capable.  Human beings will almost always help a child before an adult due to that instinct.  We perceive animals in the same light, helpless and innocent.

Is it right?  That is a question that the 'animal movement' says a resounding 'yes' to.  There is a huge movement to wean us from eating animal products.  There are movements to ban the 'ownership' of pets.  There are movements to grant animals 'rights'.  It is not surprising someone would choose their pet over a stranger because that pet is part of a family unit and a human stranger is not.
