In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. People have the right to stand up for what they believe in. If they want to help animals, then they should. If humans are suffering, more help and services are available than for animals. Humans are able to reach out and find help, but animals don't have that ability.  There are less people ready and able to help animals, which is why organizations are formed to help them. Furthermore, animals cannot speak for themselves, so they need people to speak for them. They are not able to plan ahead and prepare and adapt in emergencies.  Humans have the ability to learn how to help and save animals. Animals don't have that ability to return the favor by saving humans' lives. All in all, ",1350,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,733

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. People have the right to stand up for what they believe in. If they want to help animals, then they should. If humans are suffering, more help and services are available than for animals. Humans are able to reach out and find help, but animals don't have that ability.  There are less people ready and able to help animals, which is why organizations are formed to help them. Furthermore, animals cannot speak for themselves, so they need people to speak for them.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. People have the right to stand up for what they believe in. If they want to help animals, then they should. If humans are suffering, more help and services are available than for animals. Humans are able to reach out and find help, but animals don't have that ability.  There are less people ready and able to help animals, which is why organizations are formed to help them. Furthermore, animals cannot speak for themselves, so they need people to speak for them.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. People have the right to stand up for what they believe in. If they want to help animals, then they should. If humans are suffering, more help and services are available than for animals. Humans are able to reach out and find help, but animals don't have that ability.  There are less people ready and able to help animals, which is why organizations are formed to help them. Furthermore, animals cannot speak for themselves, so they need people to speak for them. They are not able to plan ahead and prepare and adapt in emergencies.  Humans have the ability to learn how to help and save animals. Animals don't have that ability to return the favor by saving humans' lives. All in all, I think it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. It's not that animal lovers don't care about humans. It's that they are doing their jobs and following their calling. ",1546,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,871

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?
