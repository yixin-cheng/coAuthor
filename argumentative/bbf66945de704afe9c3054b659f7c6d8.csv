In my opinion, they should be provided in schools. I feel that for some reason there is a stigma surrounding them. I'm sure many people would say it'd be no different than just offering condoms in school, though they are entirely different things. That is the issue though, how people would react. Rather than it being thought of as something like toilet paper, it brings up a sense of anxiety in even talking about such things for many people. 
I feel that it would be a great thing for schools to do, but I don't think it should be required.
 When you start requiring something is when you bring too much attention to it. People get outraged and will fight it. Leaving it optional sadly will not help everyone since more conservative schools would not participate. However, it would still allow many young girls to have access who otherwise wouldn't have before. 

I believe that money could be put aside for it, though I'm not sure if it would have to be pulled from other areas or departments. It is important though so it needs to be done. Maybe changing the way people think about such would help. If we can educate people that it's no different than a band-aid then it could be available in any medical kit at school or nurses office. I think that would be the best way of going about this.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, they should be provided in schools. I feel that for some reason there is a stigma surrounding them. I'm sure many people would say it'd be no different than just offering condoms in school, though they are entirely different things. That is the issue though, how people would react. Rather than it being thought of as something like toilet paper, it brings up a sense of anxiety in even talking about such things for many people. 
I feel that it would be a great thing for schools to do, but I don't think it should be required.
 When you start requiring something is when you bring too much attention to it. People get outraged and will fight it. Leaving it optional sadly will not help everyone since more conservative schools would not participate. However, it would still allow many young girls to have access who otherwise wouldn't have before. 

I believe that money could be put aside for it, though I'm not sure if it would have to be pulled from other areas or departments. It is important though so it needs to be done. Maybe changing the way people think about such would help. If we can educate people that it's no different than a band-aid then it could be available in any medical kit at school or nurses office. I think that would be the best way of going about this.

I'm sure many people would say it'd be no different than just offering condoms in school, though they are entirely different things. That is the issue though, how people would react. Rather than it being thought of as something like toilet paper, it brings up a sense of anxiety in even talking about such things for many people. 
I feel that it would be a great thing for schools to do, but I don't think it should be required.
 When you start requiring something is when you bring too much attention to it. People get outraged and will fight it. Leaving it optional sadly will not help everyone since more conservative schools would not participate. However, it would still allow many young girls to have access who otherwise wouldn't have before. 

I believe that money could be put aside for it, though I'm not sure if it would have to be pulled from other areas or departments. It is important though so it needs to be done. Maybe changing the way people think about such would help. If we can educate people that it's no different than a band-aid then it could be available in any medical kit at school or nurses office. I think that would be the best way of going about this.

In my opinion, they should be provided in schools. I feel that for some reason there is a stigma surrounding them. I'm sure many people would say it'd be no different than just offering condoms in school, though they are entirely different things. That is the issue though, how people would react. Rather than it being thought of as something like toilet paper, it brings up a sense of anxiety in even talking about such things for many people. 
I feel that it would be a great thing for schools to do, but I don't think it should be required.
 When you start requiring something is when you bring too much attention to it. People get outraged and will fight it. Leaving it optional sadly will not help everyone since more conservative schools would not participate. However, it would still allow many young girls to have access who otherwise wouldn't have before. 

I believe that money could be put aside for it, though I'm not sure if it would have to be pulled from other areas or departments. It is important though so it needs to be done.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, they should be provided in schools. I feel that for some reason there is a stigma surrounding them. I'm sure many people would say it'd be no different than just offering condoms in school, though they are entirely different things. That is the issue though, how people would react. Rather than it being thought of as something like toilet paper, it brings up a sense of anxiety in even talking about such things for many people. 
I feel that it would be a great thing for schools to do, but I don't think it should be required.
 When you start requiring something is when you bring too much attention to it. People get outraged and will fight it. Leaving it optional sadly will not help everyone since more conservative schools would not participate. However, it would still allow many young girls to have access who otherwise wouldn't have before. 

I believe that money could be put aside for it, though I'm not sure if it would have to be pulled from other areas or departments. It is important though so it needs to be done. Maybe changing the way people think about such would help. If we can educate people that it's no different than a band-aid then it could be available in any medical kit at school or nurses office. I think that would be the best way of going about this.

In my opinion, they should be provided in schools. I feel that for some reason there is a stigma surrounding them. I'm sure many people would say it'd be no different than just offering condoms in school, though they are entirely different things. That is the issue though, how people would react. Rather than it being thought of as something like toilet paper, it brings up a sense of anxiety in even talking about such things for many people. 
I feel that it would be a great thing for schools to do, but I don't think it should be required.
 When you start requiring something is when you bring too much attention to it. People get outraged and will fight it. Leaving it optional sadly will not help everyone since more conservative schools would not participate. However, it would still allow many young girls to have access who otherwise wouldn't have before. 

I believe that money could be put aside for it, though I'm not sure if it would have to be pulled from other areas or departments. It is important though so it needs to be done. Maybe changing the way people think about such would help. If we can educate people that it's no different than a band-aid then it could be available in any medical kit at school or nurses office. I think that would be the best way of going about this.

 When you start requiring something is when you bring too much attention to it. People get outraged and will fight it.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, they should be provided in schools. I feel that for some reason there is a stigma surrounding them. I'm sure many people would say it'd be no different than just offering condoms in school, though they are entirely different things. That is the issue though, how people would react. Rather than it being thought of as something like toilet paper, it brings up a sense of anxiety in even talking about such things for many people. 
I feel that it would be a great thing for schools to do, but I don't think it should be required.
 When you start requiring something is when you bring too much attention to it. People get outraged and will fight it. Leaving it optional sadly will not help everyone since more conservative schools would not participate. However, it would still allow many young girls to have access who otherwise wouldn't have before. 

I believe that money could be put aside for it, though I'm not sure if it would have to be pulled from other areas or departments. It is important though so it needs to be done. Maybe changing the way people think about such would help. If we can educate people that it's no different than a band-aid then it could be available in any medical kit at school or nurses office. I think that would be the best way of going about this.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, they should be provided in schools. I feel that for some reason there is a stigma surrounding them. I'm sure many people would say it'd be no different than just offering condoms in school, though they are entirely different things. That is the issue though, how people would react. Rather than it being thought of as something like toilet paper, it brings up a sense of anxiety in even talking about such things for many people. 
I feel that it would be a great thing for schools to do, but I don't think it should be required.
 When you start requiring something is when you bring too much attention to it. People get outraged and will fight it. Leaving it optional sadly will not help everyone since more conservative schools would not participate. However, it would still allow many young girls to have access who otherwise wouldn't have before. 

I believe that money could be put aside for it, though I'm not sure if it would have to be pulled from other areas or departments. It is important though so it needs to be done. Maybe changing the way people think about such would help. If we can educate people that it's no different than a band-aid then it could be available in any medical kit at school or nurses office. I think that would be the best way of going about this.
