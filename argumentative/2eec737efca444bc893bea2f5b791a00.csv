Then it really could not be called a sport, but something people can do to team up with each other to help in making sure their friends (or team mates) are remaining safer from injury, or even death.

In my opinion, I do not really think ""extreme sports"" should really even be called sports. Sports are competitive, and when you add that into extreme sports it really does make it dangerous because instead of taking extra precautions to make sure you are safe, you are trying to win.

I really think they should be more focus on being extreme hobbies instead. People can still do them, but if you remove the ""I must win"" aspect from them , then it will be a lot safer. Then it really could not be called a sport, but something people can do to team up with each other to help in making sure their friends (or team mates) are remaining safer from injury, or even death.

In my opinion, I do not really think ""extreme sports"" should really even be called sports. Sports are competitive, and when you add that into extreme sports it really does make it dangerous because instead of taking extra precautions to make sure you are safe, you are trying to win.

I really think they should be more focus on being extreme hobbies instead. People can still do them, but if you remove the ""I must win"" aspect from them , then it will be a lot safer. Then it really could not be called a sport, but something people can do to team up with each other to help in making sure their friends (or team mates) are remaining safer from injury, or even death.
