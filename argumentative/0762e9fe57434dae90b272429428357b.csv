You can learn much about people before even spending any time trying to approach them in real life.  Technology gives us more options than ever before.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has made dating better. It has made it easier to meet people and to connect with them. It has also made it easier to find out more about people before you meet them.  You can learn much about people before even spending any time trying to approach them in real life.  Technology gives us more options than ever before. 
I have used dating apps and I have met people in person through them.
 I have also met people in person who I have already known through social media. I have had a lot of good experiences with dating apps. I have met some really great people and I have had some really great dates. 

Netflix has shown us possibilities. It shows us that there are many different ways to be in a relationship. It shows us that there are many different ways to live and to love. It shows us that there are many different ways to be happy.

In my opinion, technology has made dating better. It has made it easier to meet people and to connect with them. It has also made it easier to find out more about people before you meet them.  You can learn much about people before even spending any time trying to approach them in real life.  Technology gives us more options than ever before.

 I have also met people in person who I have already known through social media. I have had a lot of good experiences with dating apps. I have met some really great people and I have had some really great dates.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has made dating better. It has made it easier to meet people and to connect with them. It has also made it easier to find out more about people before you meet them.  You can learn much about people before even spending any time trying to approach them in real life.  Technology gives us more options than ever before. 
I have used dating apps and I have met people in person through them.
 I have also met people in person who I have already known through social media. I have had a lot of good experiences with dating apps. I have met some really great people and I have had some really great dates.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has made dating better. It has made it easier to meet people and to connect with them. It has also made it easier to find out more about people before you meet them.  You can learn much about people before even spending any time trying to approach them in real life.  Technology gives us more options than ever before. 
I have used dating apps and I have met people in person through them.
 I have also met people in person who I have already known through social media. I have had a lot of good experiences with dating apps. I have met some really great people and I have had some really great dates. 

Films on sites like Netflix has shown us possibilities. It shows us that there are many different ways to be in a relationship. It shows us that there are many different ways to live and to love. It shows us that there are many different ways to be happy.
