In my opinion, the worst stereotype to ever be put in any book or on film that I have EVER seen is African American stereotypes.  know that African Americans were enslaved and treated really terribly in the past, but you can't go around saying the N word or saying that

And what if your great grandparents and from the west coast of Africa, which is a very rich place with a language of its own? And what if they were actually smart? Would you still think that African Americans are less intelligent than white people? Would you still think that black people with more melanin are more strong, which is why they excel in sports? If not, why not? You can't honestly believe that certain races are stronger than others, because that's racist. ",1240,[],0,2,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,774

Would you still think that African Americans are less intelligent than white people? Would you still think that black people with more melanin are more strong, which is why they excel in sports?

In my opinion, the worst stereotype to ever be put in any book or on film that I have EVER seen is African American stereotypes.  know that African Americans were enslaved and treated really terribly in the past, but you can't go around saying the N word or saying that
 black people have a different intelligence level than white people. I know that people use stereotypes to make themselves feel better because it allows them to lump black people together as a whole, but honestly what if one of those stereotypes was your mother? And what if your great grandparents and from the west coast of Africa, which is a very rich place with a language of its own? And what if they were actually smart? Would you still think that African Americans are less intelligent than white people? Would you still think that black people with more melanin are more strong, which is why they excel in sports? If not, why not? You can't honestly believe that certain races are stronger than others, because that's racist. You can't be racist against white people, you can only be racist against certain races.

In my opinion, the worst stereotype to ever be put in any book or on film that I have EVER seen is African American stereotypes.  know that African Americans were enslaved and treated really terribly in the past, but you can't go around saying the N word or saying that
 black people have a different intelligence level than white people. I know that people use stereotypes to make themselves feel better because it allows them to lump black people together as a whole, but honestly what if one of those stereotypes was your mother? And what if your great grandparents and from the west coast of Africa, which is a very rich place with a language of its own? And what if they were actually smart? Would you still think that African Americans are less intelligent than white people? Would you still think that black people with more melanin are more strong, which is why they excel in sports? If not, why not? You can't honestly believe that certain races are stronger than others, because that's racist. You can't be racist against white people, you can only be racist against certain races.

In my opinion, the worst stereotype to ever be put in any book or on film that I have EVER seen is African American stereotypes.  know that African Americans were enslaved and treated really terribly in the past, but you can't go around saying the N word or saying that

I know that people use stereotypes to make themselves feel better because it allows them to lump black people together as a whole, but honestly what if one of those stereotypes was your mother? And what if your great grandparents and from the west coast of Africa, which is a very rich place with a language of its own? And what if they were actually smart? Would you still think that African Americans are less intelligent than white people? Would you still think that black people with more melanin are more strong, which is why they excel in sports? If not, why not? You can't honestly believe that certain races are stronger than others, because that's racist. You can't be racist against white people, you can only be racist against certain races.

In my opinion, the worst stereotype to ever be put in any book or on film that I have EVER seen is African American stereotypes.  know that African Americans were enslaved and treated really terribly in the past, but you can't go around saying the N word or saying that
 black people have a different intelligence level than white people. I know that people use stereotypes to make themselves feel better because it allows them to lump black people together as a whole, but honestly what if one of those stereotypes was your mother? And what if your great grandparents and from the west coast of Africa, which is a very rich place with a language of its own? And what if they were actually smart? Would you still think that African Americans are less intelligent than white people? Would you still think that black people with more melanin are more strong, which is why they excel in sports? If not, why not? You can't honestly believe that certain races are stronger than others, because that's racist. You can't be racist against white people, you can only be racist against certain races. These stereotypes prevent people from seeing the person for who they really are. If we don't stop using stereotypes as soon as possible, we're going to end up like Matthew Turner.
