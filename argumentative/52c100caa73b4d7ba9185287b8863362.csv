Online dating has made it possible for the introverted or less socially skilled to meet others like them, or of not like them, others who understand and accept them. Technology helps people feel less shy when it comes to approaching the person they are interested in. It is easier to send that message of introduction or contact on apps and websites than in person.

Interestingly, the use of online dating by the socially unskilled overcomes one of the chief problems with dating apps: namely, the incessant and pervasive lying. Users who describe the problems they have with social performance are not lying to make themselves more attractive, but rather taking a risk in the hope of attracting someone who can be equally honest. There is no social upside in describing the difficulties you have in meeting or talking to people, and at the same time, there is no negative impact in saying you have difficulties unless the other person has a hard time too.

Online dating has made it possible for the introverted or less socially skilled to meet others like them, or of not like them, others who understand and accept them. Technology helps people feel less shy when it comes to approaching the person they are interested in. It is easier to send that message of introduction or contact on apps and websites than in person.

Interestingly, the use of online dating by the socially unskilled overcomes one of the chief problems with dating apps: namely, the incessant and pervasive lying. Users who describe the problems they have with social performance are not lying to make themselves more attractive, but rather taking a risk in the hope of attracting someone who can be equally honest. There is no social upside in describing the difficulties you have in meeting or talking to people, and at the same time, there is no negative impact in saying you have difficulties unless the other person has a hard time too.

Users who describe the problems they have with social performance are not lying to make themselves more attractive, but rather taking a risk in the hope of attracting someone who can be equally honest. There is no social upside in describing the difficulties you have in meeting or talking to people, and at the same time, there is no negative impact in saying you have difficulties unless the other person has a hard time too.

Online dating has made it possible for the introverted or less socially skilled to meet others like them, or of not like them, others who understand and accept them.

Users who describe the problems they have with social performance are not lying to make themselves more attractive, but rather taking a risk in the hope of attracting someone who can be equally honest.

Online dating has made it possible for the introverted or less socially skilled to meet others like them, or of not like them, others who understand and accept them. Technology helps people feel less shy when it comes to approaching the person they are interested in. It is easier to send that message of introduction or contact on apps and websites than in person.

Interestingly, the use of online dating by the socially unskilled overcomes one of the chief problems with dating apps: namely, the incessant and pervasive lying. Users who describe the problems they have with social performance are not lying to make themselves more attractive, but rather taking a risk in the hope of attracting someone who can be equally honest. There is no social upside in describing the difficulties you have in meeting or talking to people, and at the same time, there is no negative impact in saying you have difficulties unless the other person has a hard time too.

Technology helps people feel less shy when it comes to approaching the person they are interested in. It is easier to send that message of introduction or contact on apps and websites than in person.

Interestingly, the use of online dating by the socially unskilled overcomes one of the chief problems with dating apps: namely, the incessant and pervasive lying. Users who describe the problems they have with social performance are not lying to make themselves more attractive, but rather taking a risk in the hope of attracting someone who can be equally honest. There is no social upside in describing the difficulties you have in meeting or talking to people, and at the same time, there is no negative impact in saying you have difficulties unless the other person has a hard time too.

Saying one is frightened, lonely or shy, however is more a beacon then a boast: a beacon other folks in the same boat may see and be drawn too.
