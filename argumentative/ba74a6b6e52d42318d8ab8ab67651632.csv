In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are how to get along with others, and how to be successful on the job.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are how to get along with others, and how to be successful on the job. Few people go on to pursue a job that requires a highly specific degree. Most people just finish high school and get a job. Because of that they really need to learn social skills first. School forces you to be around people you may not like. You are put into classes with people you may not know. The more you learn how to get along with others the better off you will be. That skill comes in handy when it's time to work. You again will be surrounded by people you may not like and you'll need social skills to navigate the situation.

You may learn that you are good at math so you feel comfortable getting an office job where you do paperwork. On the other hand you may learn that you are better at working with people and serving them or being directly around them, such as in a doctor's office. These things you learn in school show you what you'll be good at.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are how to get along with others, and how to be successful on the job. Few people go on to pursue a job that requires a highly specific degree. Most people just finish high school and get a job. Because of that they really need to learn social skills first. School forces you to be around people you may not like. You are put into classes with people you may not know. The more you learn how to get along with others the better off you will be. That skill comes in handy when it's time to work. You again will be surrounded by people you may not like and you'll need social skills to navigate the situation. 

Second there's the job market. School will show you what things you are interested in and good at. You may learn that you are good at math so you feel comfortable getting an office job where you do paperwork. On the other hand you may learn that you are better at working with people and serving them or being directly around them, such as in a doctor's office. These things you learn in school show you what you'll be good at.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are how to get along with others, and how to be successful on the job. Few people go on to pursue a job that requires a highly specific degree. Most people just finish high school and get a job. Because of that they really need to learn social skills first. School forces you to be around people you may not like. You are put into classes with people you may not know. The more you learn how to get along with others the better off you will be. That skill comes in handy when it's time to work. You again will be surrounded by people you may not like and you'll need social skills to navigate the situation. 

Second there's the job market. School will show you what things you are interested in and good at. You may learn that you are good at math so you feel comfortable getting an office job where you do paperwork. On the other hand you may learn that you are better at working with people and serving them or being directly around them, such as in a doctor's office. These things you learn in school show you what you'll be good at.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are how to get along with others, and how to be successful on the job. Few people go on to pursue a job that requires a highly specific degree. Most people just finish high school and get a job. Because of that they really need to learn social skills first. School forces you to be around people you may not like. You are put into classes with people you may not know. The more you learn how to get along with others the better off you will be. That skill comes in handy when it's time to work. You again will be surrounded by people you may not like and you'll need social skills to navigate the situation. 

Second there's the job market. School will show you what things you are interested in and good at. You may learn that you are good at math so you feel comfortable getting an office job where you do paperwork. On the other hand you may learn that you are better at working with people and serving them or being directly around them, such as in a doctor's office. These things you learn in school show you what you'll be good at.

Obviously students need to learn the basic skills to get through life like learning English and basic math skills.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are how to get along with others, and how to be successful on the job. Few people go on to pursue a job that requires a highly specific degree. Most people just finish high school and get a job. Because of that they really need to learn social skills first. School forces you to be around people you may not like. You are put into classes with people you may not know. The more you learn how to get along with others the better off you will be. That skill comes in handy when it's time to work. You again will be surrounded by people you may not like and you'll need social skills to navigate the situation. 

Second there's the job market. School will show you what things you are interested in and good at. You may learn that you are good at math so you feel comfortable getting an office job where you do paperwork. On the other hand you may learn that you are better at working with people and serving them or being directly around them, such as in a doctor's office. These things you learn in school show you what you'll be good at.

Obviously students need to learn the basic skills to get through life like learning English and basic math skills. From there though it really comes down to just finding out your social skills and the things you enjoy doing. School helps you with those things, it really opens your eyes to many choices so that you can choose the career that fits you and the one you will want to stick with.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are how to get along with others, and how to be successful on the job. Few people go on to pursue a job that requires a highly specific degree. Most people just finish high school and get a job. Because of that they really need to learn social skills first. School forces you to be around people you may not like. You are put into classes with people you may not know. The more you learn how to get along with others the better off you will be. That skill comes in handy when it's time to work. You again will be surrounded by people you may not like and you'll need social skills to navigate the situation. 

Second there's the job market. School will show you what things you are interested in and good at. You may learn that you are good at math so you feel comfortable getting an office job where you do paperwork. On the other hand you may learn that you are better at working with people and serving them or being directly around them, such as in a doctor's office. These things you learn in school show you what you'll be good at.

From there though it really comes down to just finding out your social skills and the things you enjoy doing.

Few people go on to pursue a job that requires a highly specific degree. Most people just finish high school and get a job. Because of that they really need to learn social skills first. School forces you to be around people you may not like. You are put into classes with people you may not know. The more you learn how to get along with others the better off you will be.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are how to get along with others, and how to be successful on the job. Few people go on to pursue a job that requires a highly specific degree. Most people just finish high school and get a job. Because of that they really need to learn social skills first. School forces you to be around people you may not like. You are put into classes with people you may not know. The more you learn how to get along with others the better off you will be. That skill comes in handy when it's time to work. You again will be surrounded by people you may not like and you'll need social skills to navigate the situation.

You may learn that you are good at math so you feel comfortable getting an office job where you do paperwork.

These things you learn in school show you what you'll be good at.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are how to get along with others, and how to be successful on the job. Few people go on to pursue a job that requires a highly specific degree. Most people just finish high school and get a job. Because of that they really need to learn social skills first. School forces you to be around people you may not like. You are put into classes with people you may not know. The more you learn how to get along with others the better off you will be. That skill comes in handy when it's time to work. You again will be surrounded by people you may not like and you'll need social skills to navigate the situation. 

Second there's the job market. School will show you what things you are interested in and good at. You may learn that you are good at math so you feel comfortable getting an office job where you do paperwork. On the other hand you may learn that you are better at working with people and serving them or being directly around them, such as in a doctor's office. These things you learn in school show you what you'll be good at.

Obviously students need to learn the basic skills to get through life like learning English and basic math skills. From there though it really comes down to just finding out your social skills and the things you enjoy doing. School helps you with those things, it really opens your eyes to many choices so that you can choose the career that fits you and the one you will want to stick with.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are how to get along with others, and how to be successful on the job. Few people go on to pursue a job that requires a highly specific degree. Most people just finish high school and get a job. Because of that they really need to learn social skills first. School forces you to be around people you may not like. You are put into classes with people you may not know. The more you learn how to get along with others the better off you will be. That skill comes in handy when it's time to work. You again will be surrounded by people you may not like and you'll need social skills to navigate the situation. 

Second there's the job market. School will show you what things you are interested in and good at. You may learn that you are good at math so you feel comfortable getting an office job where you do paperwork. On the other hand you may learn that you are better at working with people and serving them or being directly around them, such as in a doctor's office. These things you learn in school show you what you'll be good at.

Obviously students need to learn the basic skills to get through life like learning English and basic math skills. From there though it really comes down to just finding out your social skills and the things you enjoy doing. School helps you with those things, it really opens your eyes to many choices so that you can choose the career that fits you and the one you will want to stick with. Since most of us will not get a college degree it is important to realistically view school for what it is.

Few people go on to pursue a job that requires a highly specific degree. Most people just finish high school and get a job. Because of that they really need to learn social skills first. School forces you to be around people you may not like. You are put into classes with people you may not know. The more you learn how to get along with others the better off you will be. That skill comes in handy when it's time to work. You again will be surrounded by people you may not like and you'll need social skills to navigate the situation. 

Second there's the job market. School will show you what things you are interested in and good at. You may learn that you are good at math so you feel comfortable getting an office job where you do paperwork. On the other hand you may learn that you are better at working with people and serving them or being directly around them, such as in a doctor's office. These things you learn in school show you what you'll be good at.

Obviously students need to learn the basic skills to get through life like learning English and basic math skills. From there though it really comes down to just finding out your social skills and the things you enjoy doing. School helps you with those things, it really opens your eyes to many choices so that you can choose the career that fits you and the one you will want to stick with. Since most of us will not get a college degree it is important to realistically view school for what it is. It's a chance to just learn about ourselves and use that to guide us through our work life as an adult",2036,[],3,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1619

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are how to get along with others, and how to be successful on the job. Few people go on to pursue a job that requires a highly specific degree. Most people just finish high school and get a job. Because of that they really need to learn social skills first. School forces you to be around people you may not like. You are put into classes with people you may not know. The more you learn how to get along with others the better off you will be. That skill comes in handy when it's time to work. You again will be surrounded by people you may not like and you'll need social skills to navigate the situation. 

Second there's the job market. School will show you what things you are interested in and good at. You may learn that you are good at math so you feel comfortable getting an office job where you do paperwork. On the other hand you may learn that you are better at working with people and serving them or being directly around them, such as in a doctor's office. These things you learn in school show you what you'll be good at.

Obviously students need to learn the basic skills to get through life like learning English and basic math skills. From there though it really comes down to just finding out your social skills and the things you enjoy doing. School helps you with those things, it really opens your eyes to many choices so that you can choose the career that fits you and the one you will want to stick with.
