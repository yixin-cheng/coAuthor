In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to know how we can make a difference not only for ourselves and our immediate communities but on the grander scale as well.  believe news of what is happening in the world helps broaden our perspective, get us to think of people outside of our lives, and
 helps us to vote properly in elections. 
The news, however, has become all about ratings, and they don't give us the most reliable information anymore. Social media is also skewing our perception of reality. The search algorithms on our news feeds also just reinforce what we already believe and does not usually give us the full story, just the parts that interest us. This is a crisis we face today and it shows in how we acted during the election and what choices we are making during the pandemic. ow Wwe got to where we are is the public educations systems fault, big techs fault and our unwillingness to challenge our own beliefs. If we were better informed and had common, objective truths that held us together we would be much better off. 
So in conclusion, it is not just important to keep up with current events, its important to view them objectively using the best evidence and not jumping to conclusions. While not engaging in current affairs does not necessary make you a bad citizen but it does take away from the much needed participation in a democracy.",1605,[],0,2,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1790
