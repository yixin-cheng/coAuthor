In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes. I almost look forward to doing tasks that would otherwise be lame without an audiobook. Another reason I prefer audiobooks is that I don't have to tire out my eyes to experience it. At the end of a hard day of thinking and staring at screens, the last thing I want to do to my eyes is stare at little letters on a page. For this alone,  think audiobooks are just as good as reading.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes. I almost look forward to doing tasks that would otherwise be lame without an audiobook. Another reason I prefer audiobooks is that I don't have to tire out my eyes to experience it. At the end of a hard day of thinking and staring at screens, the last thing I want to do to my eyes is stare at little letters on a page. For this alone,  think audiobooks are just as good as reading.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes. I almost look forward to doing tasks that would otherwise be lame without an audiobook. Another reason I prefer audiobooks is that I don't have to tire out my eyes to experience it. At the end of a hard day of thinking and staring at screens, the last thing I want to do to my eyes is stare at little letters on a page.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes. I almost look forward to doing tasks that would otherwise be lame without an audiobook. Another reason I prefer audiobooks is that I don't have to tire out my eyes to experience it.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes. I almost look forward to doing tasks that would otherwise be lame without an audiobook. Another reason I prefer audiobooks is that I don't have to tire out my eyes to experience it.

I understand braille books aren't cheap and it just seems like it would be more relaxing and enjoyable for anyone to listen to a book.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes. I almost look forward to doing tasks that would otherwise be lame without an audiobook. Another reason I prefer audiobooks is that I don't have to tire out my eyes to experience it. At the end of a hard day of thinking and staring at screens, the last thing I want to do to my eyes is stare at little letters on a page. For this alone,  think audiobooks are just as good as reading.
 Another advantage of audiobooks is one I don't experience personally but you have to admit it's fantastic that the vision impaired can experience books through audiobooks. I understand braille books aren't cheap and it just seems like it would be more relaxing and enjoyable for anyone to listen to a book. Another reason audiobooks are really great is that you can take it with you, unlike a shelf full of books. You can carry a small device to a mountaintop and listen to 10 different books if you want. I can't do that with books. It would be silly to carry a shelf of books. It may be silly to read for a week on a mountain too, but hey,",1537,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1236

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes. I almost look forward to doing tasks that would otherwise be lame without an audiobook. Another reason I prefer audiobooks is that I don't have to tire out my eyes to experience them. At the end of a hard day of thinking and staring at screens, the last thing I want to do to my eyes is stare at little letters on a page. For this alone,  think audiobooks are just as good as reading.
 Another advantage of audiobooks is one I don't experience personally but you have to admit it's fantastic that the vision impaired can experience books through audiobooks. I understand braille books aren't cheap and it just seems like it would be more relaxing and enjoyable for anyone to listen to a book. Another reason audiobooks are really great is that you can take it with you, unlike a shelf full of books. You can carry a small device to a mountaintop and listen to 10 different books if you want. I can't do that with books. It would be silly to carry a shelf of books. It may be silly to read for a week on a mountain too, but hey, the option is there, thanks to audiobooks!

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes. I almost look forward to doing tasks that would otherwise be lame without an audiobook. Another reason I prefer audiobooks is that I don't have to tire out my eyes to experience them. At the end of a hard day of thinking and staring at screens, the last thing I want to do to my eyes is stare at little letters on a page. For this alone,  think audiobooks are just as good as reading.

I understand braille books aren't cheap and it just seems like it would be more relaxing and enjoyable for anyone to listen to a book.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes. I almost look forward to doing tasks that would otherwise be lame without an audiobook. Another reason I prefer audiobooks is that I don't have to tire out my eyes to experience them. At the end of a hard day of thinking and staring at screens, the last thing I want to do to my eyes is stare at little letters on a page. For this alone,  think audiobooks are just as good as reading.
 Another advantage of audiobooks is one I don't experience personally but you have to admit it's fantastic that the vision impaired can experience books through audiobooks. I understand braille books aren't cheap and it just seems like it would be more relaxing and enjoyable for anyone to listen to a book. Another reason audiobooks are really great is that you can take it with you, unlike a shelf full of books. You can carry a small device to a mountaintop and listen to 10 different books if you want. I can't do that with books. It would be silly to carry a shelf of books. It may be silly to read for a week on a mountain too, but hey, the option is there, thanks to audiobooks!

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes. I almost look forward to doing tasks that would otherwise be lame without an audiobook. Another reason I prefer audiobooks is that I don't have to tire out my eyes to experience them.
