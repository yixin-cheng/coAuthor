In my opinion, it should be up to the school to decide whether or not to provide free pads and tampons. In this day and age, every school is under different circumstances.

Some schools are in poverty, and some schools have a lot of money. Some schools are balanced when it comes to gender, and then there are schools that are all female. Some schools have a lot of students, and some schools have a small amount of students. Whether or not to provide a new supply to students comes down to money in the budget. Each school would need to look at their budget and funding to see if they could afford to provide free pads and tampons. If their funds allow it, then they are free to make feminine hygiene products available to students. If they can't afford to do this, they can look at alternate ways of funding this. For example, they could have a fundraiser to raise money for this. They could ask for donations from the community.

In my opinion, it should be up to the school to decide whether or not to provide free pads and tampons. In this day and age, every school is under different circumstances. Some schools are in poverty, and some schools have a lot of money. Some schools are balanced when it comes to gender, and then there are schools that are all female. Some schools have a lot of students, and some schools have a small amount of students. Whether or not to provide a new supply to students comes down to money in the budget. Each school would need to look at their budget and funding to see if they could afford to provide free pads and tampons. If their funds allow it, then they are free to make feminine hygiene products available to students. If they can't afford to do this, they can look at alternate ways of funding this. For example, they could have a fundraiser to raise money for this. They could ask for donations from the community.

Another thing that schools could do is offer students the ability to stay home when menstruating. This would allow students to have a day off from school when they are experiencing heavy bleeding. This would lessen the burden of the students needing hygiene products at school. ",1578,[],0,1,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,835

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, it should be up to the school to decide whether or not to provide free pads and tampons. In this day and age, every school is under different circumstances. Some schools are in poverty, and some schools have a lot of money. Some schools are balanced when it comes to gender, and then there are schools that are all female. Some schools have a lot of students, and some schools have a small amount of students. Whether or not to provide a new supply to students comes down to money in the budget. Each school would need to look at their budget and funding to see if they could afford to provide free pads and tampons. If their funds allow it, then they are free to make feminine hygiene products available to students. If they can't afford to do this, they can look at alternate ways of funding this. For example, they could have a fundraiser to raise money for this. They could ask for donations from the community.

Another thing that schools could do is offer students the ability to stay home when menstruating. This would allow students to have a day off from school when they are experiencing heavy bleeding. This would lessen the burden of the students needing hygiene products at school.  Supplies would last longer and make it more affordable for the school to provide them.

In my opinion, it should be up to the school to decide whether or not to provide free pads and tampons. In this day and age, every school is under different circumstances. Some schools are in poverty, and some schools have a lot of money. Some schools are balanced when it comes to gender, and then there are schools that are all female. Some schools have a lot of students, and some schools have a small amount of students. Whether or not to provide a new supply to students comes down to money in the budget. Each school would need to look at their budget and funding to see if they could afford to provide free pads and tampons. If their funds allow it, then they are free to make feminine hygiene products available to students. If they can't afford to do this, they can look at alternate ways of funding this. For example, they could have a fundraiser to raise money for this. They could ask for donations from the community.

Another thing that schools could do is offer students the ability to stay home when menstruating. This would allow students to have a day off from school when they are experiencing heavy bleeding. This would lessen the burden of the students needing hygiene products at school.  Supplies would last longer and make it more affordable for the school to provide them.

Some schools are in poverty, and some schools have a lot of money. Some schools are balanced when it comes to gender, and then there are schools that are all female. Some schools have a lot of students, and some schools have a small amount of students. Whether or not to provide a new supply to students comes down to money in the budget. Each school would need to look at their budget and funding to see if they could afford to provide free pads and tampons. If their funds allow it, then they are free to make feminine hygiene products available to students. If they can't afford to do this, they can look at alternate ways of funding this. For example, they could have a fundraiser to raise money for this. They could ask for donations from the community.

Another thing that schools could do is offer students the ability to stay home when menstruating. This would allow students to have a day off from school when they are experiencing heavy bleeding. This would lessen the burden of the students needing hygiene products at school.  Supplies would last longer and make it more affordable for the school to provide them.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, it should be up to the school to decide whether or not to provide free pads and tampons. In this day and age, every school is under different circumstances. Some schools are in poverty, and some schools have a lot of money. Some schools are balanced when it comes to gender, and then there are schools that are all female. Some schools have a lot of students, and some schools have a small amount of students. Whether or not to provide a new supply to students comes down to money in the budget. Each school would need to look at their budget and funding to see if they could afford to provide free pads and tampons. If their funds allow it, then they are free to make feminine hygiene products available to students. If they can't afford to do this, they can look at alternate ways of funding this. For example, they could have a fundraiser to raise money for this. They could ask for donations from the community.

In my opinion, it should be up to the school to decide whether or not to provide free pads and tampons. In this day and age, every school is under different circumstances. Some schools are in poverty, and some schools have a lot of money. Some schools are balanced when it comes to gender, and then there are schools that are all female. Some schools have a lot of students, and some schools have a small amount of students. Whether or not to provide a new supply to students comes down to money in the budget. Each school would need to look at their budget and funding to see if they could afford to provide free pads and tampons. If their funds allow it, then they are free to make feminine hygiene products available to students. If they can't afford to do this, they can look at alternate ways of funding this. For example, they could have a fundraiser to raise money for this. They could ask for donations from the community.

Another thing that schools could do is offer students the ability to stay home when menstruating. This would allow students to have a day off from school when they are experiencing heavy bleeding. This would lessen the burden of the students needing hygiene products at school.  Supplies would last longer and make it more affordable for the school to provide them.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, it should be up to the school to decide whether or not to provide free pads and tampons. In this day and age, every school is under different circumstances. Some schools are in poverty, and some schools have a lot of money. Some schools are balanced when it comes to gender, and then there are schools that are all female. Some schools have a lot of students, and some schools have a small amount of students. Whether or not to provide a new supply to students comes down to money in the budget. Each school would need to look at their budget and funding to see if they could afford to provide free pads and tampons. If their funds allow it, then they are free to make feminine hygiene products available to students. If they can't afford to do this, they can look at alternate ways of funding this. For example, they could have a fundraiser to raise money for this. They could ask for donations from the community.

Another thing that schools could do is offer students the ability to stay home when menstruating. This would allow students to have a day off from school when they are experiencing heavy bleeding.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, it should be up to the school to decide whether or not to provide free pads and tampons. In this day and age, every school is under different circumstances. Some schools are in poverty, and some schools have a lot of money. Some schools are balanced when it comes to gender, and then there are schools that are all female. Some schools have a lot of students, and some schools have a small amount of students. Whether or not to provide a new supply to students comes down to money in the budget. Each school would need to look at their budget and funding to see if they could afford to provide free pads and tampons. If their funds allow it, then they are free to make feminine hygiene products available to students. If they can't afford to do this, they can look at alternate ways of funding this. For example, they could have a fundraiser to raise money for this. They could ask for donations from the community.
