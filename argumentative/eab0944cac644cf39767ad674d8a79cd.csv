When a person is disagreeable or otherwise hurts our ego, people sometimes see them as less than human. This happens with discrimination against groups.

In my opinion, people can sometimes be more empathetic toward animals because they don't challenge us the way that other people do. A dog will never argue or disagree with you the way a human will do. Some people simply don't like being challenged or presented with any resistance because of weaknesses in their personality. When a person is disagreeable or otherwise hurts our ego, people sometimes see them as less than human. This happens with discrimination against groups.
In some ways, people see their pet dog as an extension of themselves.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, people can sometimes be more empathetic toward animals because they don't challenge us the way that other people do. A dog will never argue or disagree with you the way a human will do. Some people simply don't like being challenged or presented with any resistance because of weaknesses in their personality. When a person is disagreeable or otherwise hurts our ego, people sometimes see them as less than human. This happens with discrimination against groups.
In some ways, people see their pet dog as an extension of themselves. For this reason they are likely to care more for the dog than other people.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people can sometimes be more empathetic toward animals because they don't challenge us the way that other people do. A dog will never argue or disagree with you the way a human will do. Some people simply don't like being challenged or presented with any resistance because of weaknesses in their personality. When a person is disagreeable or otherwise hurts our ego, people sometimes see them as less than human. This happens with discrimination against groups.
In some ways, people see their pet dog as an extension of themselves. For this reason they are likely to care more for the dog than other people.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people can sometimes be more empathetic toward animals because they don't challenge us the way that other people do. A dog will never argue or disagree with you the way a human will do. Some people simply don't like being challenged or presented with any resistance because of weaknesses in their personality. When a person is disagreeable or otherwise hurts our ego, people sometimes see them as less than human. This happens with discrimination against groups.
In some ways, people see their pet dog as an extension of themselves. For this reason they are likely to care more for the dog than other people.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people can sometimes be more empathetic toward animals because they don't challenge us the way that other people do. A dog will never argue or disagree with you the way a human will do. Some people simply don't like being challenged or presented with any resistance because of weaknesses in their personality. When a person is disagreeable or otherwise hurts our ego, people sometimes see them as less than human. This happens with discrimination against groups.
In some ways, people see their pet dog as an extension of themselves. For this reason they are likely to care more for the dog than other people.

In my opinion, people can sometimes be more empathetic toward animals because they don't challenge us the way that other people do. A dog will never argue or disagree with you the way a human will do. Some people simply don't like being challenged or presented with any resistance because of weaknesses in their personality. When a person is disagreeable or otherwise hurts our ego, people sometimes see them as less than human. This happens with discrimination against groups.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people can sometimes be more empathetic toward animals because they don't challenge us the way that other people do. A dog will never argue or disagree with you the way a human will do. Some people simply don't like being challenged or presented with any resistance because of weaknesses in their personality. When a person is disagreeable or otherwise hurts our ego, people sometimes see them as less than human. This happens with discrimination against groups.
In some ways, people see their pet dog as an extension of themselves. For this reason they are likely to care more for the dog than other people.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people can sometimes be more empathetic toward animals because they don't challenge us the way that other people do. A dog will never argue or disagree with you the way a human will do. Some people simply don't like being challenged or presented with any resistance because of weaknesses in their personality. When a person is disagreeable or otherwise hurts our ego, people sometimes see them as less than human. This happens with discrimination against groups.
In some ways, people see their pet dog as an extension of themselves. For this reason they are likely to care more for the dog than other people. 
I don't think it's wrong to focus on animal welfare when people are suffering because the animals matter too. It is human nature to care sometimes and not other times.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, people can sometimes be more empathetic toward animals because they don't challenge us the way that other people do. A dog will never argue or disagree with you the way a human will do. Some people simply don't like being challenged or presented with any resistance because of weaknesses in their personality. When a person is disagreeable or otherwise hurts our ego, people sometimes see them as less than human. This happens with discrimination against groups.
In some ways, people see their pet dog as an extension of themselves. For this reason they are likely to care more for the dog than other people.
