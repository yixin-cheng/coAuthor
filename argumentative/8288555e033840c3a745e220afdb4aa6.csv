In my opinion, listening to audiobooks are superior to reading books.  When you listen to an audiobook, it makes me feel we are honoring the oral traditions of our ancestors.  Before writing become common place, human's stories were passed orally.   A travelling author may go from town to town spreading his story.   People would gather together to listen to the storyteller, and the story itself would be interpreted and revised by the townspeople.   Listening to audiobooks continues that tradition.

Additionally, I believe it is easier to use your imagination when the story is being read to you.  When reading, there are times when I have to re-read sentences over again because the sentences appeared ""odd"" while reading them.  While listening to an audiobook, I don't have to worry about this issue.   I feel that listening to the audiobook is less mentally demanding than reading.  I am really able to sit back, relax, and enjoy the literature.

In my opinion, listening to audiobooks are superior to reading books.  When you listen to an audiobook, it makes me feel we are honoring the oral traditions of our ancestors.  Before writing become common place, human's stories were passed orally.   A travelling author may go from town to town spreading his story.   People would gather together to listen to the storyteller, and the story itself would be interpreted and revised by the townspeople.   Listening to audiobooks continues that tradition.

Additionally, I believe it is easier to use your imagination when the story is being read to you.  When reading, there are times when I have to re-read sentences over again because the sentences appeared ""odd"" while reading them.  While listening to an audiobook, I don't have to worry about this issue.   I feel that listening to the audiobook is less mentally demanding than reading.  I am really able to sit back, relax, and enjoy the literature.

In my opinion, listening to audiobooks are superior to reading books.  When you listen to an audiobook, it makes me feel we are honoring the oral traditions of our ancestors.  Before writing become common place, human's stories were passed orally.   A travelling author may go from town to town spreading his story.   People would gather together to listen to the storyteller, and the story itself would be interpreted and revised by the townspeople.   Listening to audiobooks continues that tradition.

Additionally, I believe it is easier to use your imagination when the story is being read to you.  When reading, there are times when I have to re-read sentences over again because the sentences appeared ""odd"" while reading them.  While listening to an audiobook, I don't have to worry about this issue.   I feel that listening to the audiobook is less mentally demanding than reading.  I am really able to sit back, relax, and enjoy the literature.

Reading books is still entertaining to me.  However, I think that listening to audiobooks with a great narrator is much more enjoyable.

In my opinion, listening to audiobooks are superior to reading books.  When you listen to an audiobook, it makes me feel we are honoring the oral traditions of our ancestors.  Before writing become common place, human's stories were passed orally.   A travelling author may go from town to town spreading his story.   People would gather together to listen to the storyteller, and the story itself would be interpreted and revised by the townspeople.   Listening to audiobooks continues that tradition.

Additionally, I believe it is easier to use your imagination when the story is being read to you.  When reading, there are times when I have to re-read sentences over again because the sentences appeared ""odd"" while reading them.  While listening to an audiobook, I don't have to worry about this issue.   I feel that listening to the audiobook is less mentally demanding than reading.  I am really able to sit back, relax, and enjoy the literature.

Reading books is still entertaining to me.  However, I think that listening to audiobooks with a great narrator is much more enjoyable.  Some audiobooks may have different sound effects that are added throughout the reading.  This helps to immerse yourself even more into the book.  When a scene in the book has rain, and you can hear a rain sound effect in the audiobook, I feel like I am living in the scene.

Before writing become common place, human's stories were passed orally.   A travelling author may go from town to town spreading his story.   People would gather together to listen to the storyteller, and the story itself would be interpreted and revised by the townspeople.   Listening to audiobooks continues that tradition.

Additionally, I believe it is easier to use your imagination when the story is being read to you.  When reading, there are times when I have to re-read sentences over again because the sentences appeared ""odd"" while reading them.  While listening to an audiobook, I don't have to worry about this issue.   I feel that listening to the audiobook is less mentally demanding than reading.  I am really able to sit back, relax, and enjoy the literature.

Reading books is still entertaining to me.  However, I think that listening to audiobooks with a great narrator is much more enjoyable.  Some audiobooks may have different sound effects that are added throughout the reading.  This helps to immerse yourself even more into the book.  When a scene in the book has rain, and you can hear a rain sound effect in the audiobook, I feel like I am living in the scene.

In my opinion, listening to audiobooks are superior to reading books.  When you listen to an audiobook, it makes me feel we are honoring the oral traditions of our ancestors.  Before writing become common place, human's stories were passed orally.   A travelling author may go from town to town spreading his story.   People would gather together to listen to the storyteller, and the story itself would be interpreted and revised by the townspeople.   Listening to audiobooks continues that tradition.

Additionally, I believe it is easier to use your imagination when the story is being read to you.  When reading, there are times when I have to re-read sentences over again because the sentences appeared ""odd"" while reading them.  While listening to an audiobook, I don't have to worry about this issue.   I feel that listening to the audiobook is less mentally demanding than reading.  I am really able to sit back, relax, and enjoy the literature.

Reading books is still entertaining to me.  However, I think that listening to audiobooks with a great narrator is much more enjoyable.  Some audiobooks may have different sound effects that are added throughout the reading.  This helps to immerse yourself even more into the book.

In my opinion, listening to audiobooks are superior to reading books.  When you listen to an audiobook, it makes me feel we are honoring the oral traditions of our ancestors.  Before writing become common place, human's stories were passed orally.   A travelling author may go from town to town spreading his story.   People would gather together to listen to the storyteller, and the story itself would be interpreted and revised by the townspeople.   Listening to audiobooks continues that tradition.

Additionally, I believe it is easier to use your imagination when the story is being read to you.  When reading, there are times when I have to re-read sentences over again because the sentences appeared ""odd"" while reading them.  While listening to an audiobook, I don't have to worry about this issue.   I feel that listening to the audiobook is less mentally demanding than reading.  I am really able to sit back, relax, and enjoy the literature.

Reading books is still entertaining to me.  However, I think that listening to audiobooks with a great narrator is much more enjoyable.  Some audiobooks may have different sound effects that are added throughout the reading.  This helps to immerse yourself even more into the book.  When a scene in the book has rain, and you can hear a rain sound effect in the audiobook, I feel like I am living in the scene.

In my opinion, listening to audiobooks are superior to reading books.  When you listen to an audiobook, it makes me feel we are honoring the oral traditions of our ancestors.  Before writing become common place, human's stories were passed orally.   A travelling author may go from town to town spreading his story.   People would gather together to listen to the storyteller, and the story itself would be interpreted and revised by the townspeople.   Listening to audiobooks continues that tradition.

Additionally, I believe it is easier to use your imagination when the story is being read to you.  When reading, there are times when I have to re-read sentences over again because the sentences appeared ""odd"" while reading them.  While listening to an audiobook, I don't have to worry about this issue.   I feel that listening to the audiobook is less mentally demanding than reading.  I am really able to sit back, relax, and enjoy the literature.

Reading books is still entertaining to me.  However, I think that listening to audiobooks with a great narrator is much more enjoyable.  Some audiobooks may have different sound effects that are added throughout the reading.  This helps to immerse yourself even more into the book.

Before writing become common place, human's stories were passed orally.   A travelling author may go from town to town spreading his story.   People would gather together to listen to the storyteller, and the story itself would be interpreted and revised by the townspeople.   Listening to audiobooks continues that tradition.

Additionally, I believe it is easier to use your imagination when the story is being read to you.  When reading, there are times when I have to re-read sentences over again because the sentences appeared ""odd"" while reading them.  While listening to an audiobook, I don't have to worry about this issue.   I feel that listening to the audiobook is less mentally demanding than reading.  I am really able to sit back, relax, and enjoy the literature.

Reading books is still entertaining to me.  However, I think that listening to audiobooks with a great narrator is much more enjoyable.  Some audiobooks may have different sound effects that are added throughout the reading.  This helps to immerse yourself even more into the book.  When a scene in the book has rain, and you can hear a rain sound effect in the audiobook, I feel like I am living in the scene.

In my opinion, listening to audiobooks are superior to reading books.  When you listen to an audiobook, it makes me feel we are honoring the oral traditions of our ancestors.  Before writing become common place, human's stories were passed orally.   A travelling author may go from town to town spreading his story.   People would gather together to listen to the storyteller, and the story itself would be interpreted and revised by the townspeople.   Listening to audiobooks continues that tradition.

Additionally, I believe it is easier to use your imagination when the story is being read to you.  When reading, there are times when I have to re-read sentences over again because the sentences appeared ""odd"" while reading them.  While listening to an audiobook, I don't have to worry about this issue.   I feel that listening to the audiobook is less mentally demanding than reading.  I am really able to sit back, relax, and enjoy the literature.

Reading books is still entertaining to me.  However, I think that listening to audiobooks with a great narrator is much more enjoyable.  Some audiobooks may have different sound effects that are added throughout the reading.  This helps to immerse yourself even more into the book.  When a scene in the book has rain, and you can hear a rain sound effect in the audiobook, I feel like I am living in the scene.

Another benefit of audiobooks is I am able to listen to the audiobooks while exercising or travelling.  I am able to perform other tasks while listening to the books which is great.

Before writing become common place, human's stories were passed orally.   A travelling author may go from town to town spreading his story.   People would gather together to listen to the storyteller, and the story itself would be interpreted and revised by the townspeople.   Listening to audiobooks continues that tradition.

Additionally, I believe it is easier to use your imagination when the story is being read to you.  When reading, there are times when I have to re-read sentences over again because the sentences appeared ""odd"" while reading them.  While listening to an audiobook, I don't have to worry about this issue.   I feel that listening to the audiobook is less mentally demanding than reading.  I am really able to sit back, relax, and enjoy the literature.

Reading books is still entertaining to me.  However, I think that listening to audiobooks with a great narrator is much more enjoyable.  Some audiobooks may have different sound effects that are added throughout the reading.  This helps to immerse yourself even more into the book.  When a scene in the book has rain, and you can hear a rain sound effect in the audiobook, I feel like I am living in the scene.

Another benefit of audiobooks is I am able to listen to the audiobooks while exercising or travelling.  I am able to perform other tasks while listening to the books which is great.

In my opinion, listening to audiobooks are superior to reading books.  When you listen to an audiobook, it makes me feel we are honoring the oral traditions of our ancestors.  Before writing become common place, human's stories were passed orally.   A travelling author may go from town to town spreading his story.   People would gather together to listen to the storyteller, and the story itself would be interpreted and revised by the townspeople.   Listening to audiobooks continues that tradition.

Additionally, I believe it is easier to use your imagination when the story is being read to you.  When reading, there are times when I have to re-read sentences over again because the sentences appeared ""odd"" while reading them.  While listening to an audiobook, I don't have to worry about this issue.   I feel that listening to the audiobook is less mentally demanding than reading.  I am really able to sit back, relax, and enjoy the literature.

Reading books is still entertaining to me.  However, I think that listening to audiobooks with a great narrator is much more enjoyable.  Some audiobooks may have different sound effects that are added throughout the reading.  This helps to immerse yourself even more into the book.  When a scene in the book has rain, and you can hear a rain sound effect in the audiobook, I feel like I am living in the scene.

Another benefit of audiobooks is I am able to listen to the audiobooks while exercising or travelling.  I am able to perform other tasks while listening to the books which is great.

Overall, reading books is a pleasurable experience.  I think that utiliz",1883,[],0,1,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,2494

In my opinion, listening to audiobooks are superior to reading books.  When you listen to an audiobook, it makes me feel we are honoring the oral traditions of our ancestors.  Before writing become common place, human's stories were passed orally.   A travelling author may go from town to town spreading his story.   People would gather together to listen to the storyteller, and the story itself would be interpreted and revised by the townspeople.   Listening to audiobooks continues that tradition.

Additionally, I believe it is easier to use your imagination when the story is being read to you.  When reading, there are times when I have to re-read sentences over again because the sentences appeared ""odd"" while reading them.  While listening to an audiobook, I don't have to worry about this issue.   I feel that listening to the audiobook is less mentally demanding than reading.  I am really able to sit back, relax, and enjoy the literature.

Reading books is still entertaining to me.  However, I think that listening to audiobooks with a great narrator is much more enjoyable.  Some audiobooks may have different sound effects that are added throughout the reading.  This helps to immerse yourself even more into the book.  When a scene in the book has rain, and you can hear a rain sound effect in the audiobook, I feel like I am living in the scene.

Overall, reading books is a pleasurable experience.  I think that utilizing an audiobook is even more pleasurable.  I suggest everyone try an audiobook at least once.",1977,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,2558
