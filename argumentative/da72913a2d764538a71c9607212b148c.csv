Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000!

Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day?

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper ",1482,[],0,2,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,680

Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad.

Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day?

Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. ",1691,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,761

I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked.

Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess.",1798,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,791

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000!

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment.

The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment.

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons.

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak ",1949,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,892

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked.

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personall",2010,[],3,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,919

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment.

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students bec",2085,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,946

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons.

I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000!

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000!

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons.

Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000!

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say tha",2391,[],1,1,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1245

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked.

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function?

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's?

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's?

Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and ",2505,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1348

I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function?

Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. ",2530,[],0,4,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1381

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. i",2531,[],0,4,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1392

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000!

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000!

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be as",2681,[],1,1,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1524

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a ",2692,[],0,4,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1545

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment.

The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000!

Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So ",2773,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1587

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just star",2797,[],0,2,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1618

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start finding ",2807,[],0,2,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1628

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons.

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money.

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start finding the resources to provide free pads and tampons to students.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons.

Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start finding the resources to provide free pads and tampons to students. It's really a small price to pay for a girl's dignity and for a girl's future financial freedom and se",2969,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1728

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start finding the resources to provide free pads and tampons to students.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start finding the resources to provide free pads and tampons to students.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start finding the resources to provide free pads and tampons to students. It's really a small price to pay for a girl's dignity and for a girl's future financial freedom and security. For these reasons, I h",2999,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1767

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students.

I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start finding the resources to provide free pads and tampons to students. It's really a small price to pay for a girl's dignity and for a girl's future financial freedom and security. For these reasons, I humbly request school ",3019,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1796

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start finding the resources to provide free pads and tampons to students. It's really a small price to pay for a girl's dignity and for a girl's future financial freedom and security. For these reasons, I humbly request school districts ",3029,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1806

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start finding the resources to provide free pads and tampons to students. It's really a small price to pay for a girl's dignity and for a girl's future financial freedom and security. For these reasons, I humbly request school districts across the country to consideprovide free pads and tampons to students.",3059,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1825

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground.

Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start finding the resources to provide free pads and tampons to students. It's really a small price to pay for a girl's dignity and for a girl's future financial freedom and security. For these reasons, I humbly request school districts across the country to consider the arguments madprovide free pads and tampons to students.",3078,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1844

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate.

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start finding the resources to provide free pads and tampons to students. It's really a small price to pay for a girl's dignity and for a girl's future financial freedom and security. For these reasons, I humbly request school districts across the country to consider the arguments made herein and provide free pads and tampons to thestudents.",3127,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1863
