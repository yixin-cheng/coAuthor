In my opinion, I don't believe it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. We should focus on both with an emphasis on humans.

In that respect, nature and humanity are interdependent and must be protected. Unfortunately, humans are selfish creatures and many will ignore the well being of others if it gives them an advantage so it is important that we have safe guards in place to help protect the animals and their habitats so humanity has meat and crops to eat.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I don't believe it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. We should focus on both with an emphasis on humans. If nature is doing well then humanity is able to continue on as it develops as a species but if nature is not doing well then it will have an impact on human well being. In that respect, nature and humanity are interdependent and must be protected. Unfortunately, humans are selfish creatures and many will ignore the well being of others if it gives them an advantage so it is important that we have safe guards in place to help protect the animals and their habitats so humanity has meat and crops to eat.

In my opinion, I don't believe it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. We should focus on both with an emphasis on humans. If nature is doing well then humanity is able to continue on as it develops as a species but if nature is not doing well then it will have an impact on human well being. In that respect, nature and humanity are interdependent and must be protected. Unfortunately, humans are selfish creatures and many will ignore the well being of others if it gives them an advantage so it is important that we have safe guards in place to help protect the animals and their habitats so humanity has meat and crops to eat. We have to have a more of a symbiotic relationship with our animal cousins so we respect them more and not ignore the harsh realities of things like factory farming.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, I don't believe it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. We should focus on both with an emphasis on humans. If nature is doing well then humanity is able to continue on as it develops as a species but if nature is not doing well then it will have an impact on human well being. In that respect, nature and humanity are interdependent and must be protected. Unfortunately, humans are selfish creatures and many will ignore the well being of others if it gives them an advantage so it is important that we have safe guards in place to help protect the animals and their habitats so humanity has meat and crops to eat.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I don't believe it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. We should focus on both with an emphasis on humans. If nature is doing well then humanity is able to continue on as it develops as a species but if nature is not doing well then it will have an impact on human well being. In that respect, nature and humanity are interdependent and must be protected. Unfortunately, humans are selfish creatures and many will ignore the well being of others if it gives them an advantage so it is important that we have safe guards in place to help protect the animals and their habitats so humanity has meat and crops to eat.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, I don't believe it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. We should focus on both with an emphasis on humans. If nature is doing well then humanity is able to continue on as it develops as a species but if nature is not doing well then it will have an impact on human well being. In that respect, nature and humanity are interdependent and must be protected. Unfortunately, humans are selfish creatures and many will ignore the well being of others if it gives them an advantage so it is important that we have safe guards in place to help protect the animals and their habitats so humanity has meat and crops to eat.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, I don't believe it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. We should focus on both with an emphasis on humans. If nature is doing well then humanity is able to continue on as it develops as a species but if nature is not doing well then it will have an impact on human well being. In that respect, nature and humanity are interdependent and must be protected. Unfortunately, humans are selfish creatures and many will ignore the well being of others if it gives them an advantage so it is important that we have safe guards in place to help protect the animals and their habitats so humanity has meat and crops to eat.

If nature is doing well then humanity is able to continue on as it develops as a species but if nature is not doing well then it will have an impact on human well being. In that respect, nature and humanity are interdependent and must be protected. Unfortunately, humans are selfish creatures and many will ignore the well being of others if it gives them an advantage so it is important that we have safe guards in place to help protect the animals and their habitats so humanity has meat and crops to eat. We have to have a more of a symbiotic relationship with our animal cousins so we respect them more and not ignore the harsh realities of things like factory farming. They tourture animals and they can also breed plenty of disease as well that does cross over to hum",1499,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1090

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, I don't believe it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. We should focus on both with an emphasis on humans. If nature is doing well then humanity is able to continue on as it develops as a species but if nature is not doing well then it will have an impact on human well being. In that respect, nature and humanity are interdependent and must be protected. Unfortunately, humans are selfish creatures and many will ignore the well being of others if it gives them an advantage so it is important that we have safe guards in place to help protect the animals and their habitats so humanity has meat and crops to eat.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I don't believe it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. We should focus on both with an emphasis on humans. If nature is doing well then humanity is able to continue on as it develops as a species but if nature is not doing well then it will have an impact on human well being. In that respect, nature and humanity are interdependent and must be protected. Unfortunately, humans are selfish creatures and many will ignore the well being of others if it gives them an advantage so it is important that we have safe guards in place to help protect the animals and their habitats so humanity has meat and crops to eat. We have to have a more of a symbiotic relationship with our animal cousins so we respect them more and not ignore the harsh realities of things like factory farming.

We have to have a more of a symbiotic relationship with our animal cousins so we respect them more and not ignore the harsh realities of things like factory farming.

In my opinion, I don't believe it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. We should focus on both with an emphasis on humans. If nature is doing well then humanity is able to continue on as it develops as a species but if nature is not doing well then it will have an impact on human well being. In that respect, nature and humanity are interdependent and must be protected. Unfortunately, humans are selfish creatures and many will ignore the well being of others if it gives them an advantage so it is important that we have safe guards in place to help protect the animals and their habitats so humanity has meat and crops to eat. We have to have a more of a symbiotic relationship with our animal cousins so we respect them more and not ignore the harsh realities of things like factory farming.

If nature is doing well then humanity is able to continue on as it develops as a species but if nature is not doing well then it will have an impact on human well being. In that respect, nature and humanity are interdependent and must be protected. Unfortunately, humans are selfish creatures and many will ignore the well being of others if it gives them an advantage so it is important that we have safe guards in place to help protect the animals and their habitats so humanity has meat and crops to eat. We have to have a more of a symbiotic relationship with our animal cousins so we respect them more and not ignore the harsh realities of things like factory farming. They torture animals and they can also breed plenty of disease as well that does cross over to humans. In this respect, it is vital that we protect our food production system and fight inhumane treatment of animals as well as protecting ecosystems in general. We must balance things out so we can take care of both sides not just one. We must not pick and choose which side we will focus on. They are two s",1806,[],3,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1255

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, I don't believe it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. We should focus on both with an emphasis on humans. If nature is doing well then humanity is able to continue on as it develops as a species but if nature is not doing well then it will have an impact on human well being. In that respect, nature and humanity are interdependent and must be protected. Unfortunately, humans are selfish creatures and many will ignore the well being of others if it gives them an advantage so it is important that we have safe guards in place to help protect the animals and their habitats so humanity has meat and crops to eat. We have to have a more of a symbiotic relationship with our animal cousins so we respect them more and not ignore the harsh realities of things like factory farming. They torture animals and they can also breed plenty of disease as well that does cross over to humans. In this respect, it is vital that we protect our food production system and fight inhumane treatment of animals as well as protecting ecosystems in general.

In my opinion, I don't believe it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. We should focus on both with an emphasis on humans. If nature is doing well then humanity is able to continue on as it develops as a species but if nature is not doing well then it will have an impact on human well being.

In my opinion, I don't believe it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. We should focus on both with an emphasis on humans. If nature is doing well then humanity is able to continue on as it develops as a species but if nature is not doing well then it will have an impact on human well being. In that respect, nature and humanity are interdependent and must be protected. Unfortunately, humans are selfish creatures and many will ignore the well being of others if it gives them an advantage so it is important that we have safe guards in place to help protect the animals and their habitats so humanity has meat and crops to eat. We have to have a more of a symbiotic relationship with our animal cousins so we respect them more and not ignore the harsh realities of things like factory farming. They torture animals and they can also breed plenty of disease as well that does cross over to humans. In this respect, it is vital that we protect our food production system and fight inhumane treatment of animals as well as protecting ecosystems in general. We must balance things out so we can take care of both sides not just one. We must not pick and choose which side we will focus on. They are two sides of the same coin.

In my opinion, I don't believe it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. We should focus on both with an emphasis on humans.

In my opinion, I don't believe it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. We should focus on both with an emphasis on humans. If nature is doing well then humanity is able to continue on as it develops as a species but if nature is not doing well then it will have an impact on human well being. In that respect, nature and humanity are interdependent and must be protected. Unfortunately, humans are selfish creatures and many will ignore the well being of others if it gives them an advantage so it is important that we have safe guards in place to help protect the animals and their habitats so humanity has meat and crops to eat. We have to have a more of a symbiotic relationship with our animal cousins so we respect them more and not ignore the harsh realities of things like factory farming.

If nature is doing well then humanity is able to continue on as it develops as a species but if nature is not doing well then it will have an impact on human well being. In that respect, nature and humanity are interdependent and must be protected. Unfortunately, humans are selfish creatures and many will ignore the well being of others if it gives them an advantage so it is important that we have safe guards in place to help protect the animals and their habitats so humanity has meat and crops to eat. We have to have a more of a symbiotic relationship with our animal cousins so we respect them more and not ignore the harsh realities of things like factory farming. They torture animals and they can also breed plenty of disease as well that does cross over to humans. In this respect, it is vital that we protect our food production system and fight inhumane treatment of animals as well as protecting ecosystems in general. We must balance things out so we can take care of both sides not just one. We must not pick and choose which side we will focus on. They are two sides of the same coin.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.
