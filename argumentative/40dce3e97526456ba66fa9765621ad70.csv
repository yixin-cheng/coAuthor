In my opinion, some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. I think, for example, that high-risk sports like extreme mountain climbing are inherently selfish and should not be indulged. xtreme mountain climbing, like other sports that carry with them excessive danger, such as riding motorcycles without a helmet and handguns without a proper license,
 are too dangerous to be pursued as a sport. 
Before we examine these activities which are dangerous, let's define sport.
 Merriam-Webster defines ""sport"" as ""exercise intended to delight or amuse,"" and ""a game played according to the rules"". In other words, sport is something that is done for the enjoyment of doing it. Extreme mountain climbing is not, of course, an activity undertaken for enjoyment - it is undertaken for the purpose of, well, climbing mountains. This is quite a different matter from taking part in sports like running, swimming, cycling and volleyball. n these kinds of sports, people can stay healthy wand pretty safe hile working-out.
 Extreme mountain climbing, on the other hand, is akin to playing Russian roulette. eople who practice extreme mountain climbing hurt themselves,and others, if they are not experienced and adequately trained.
 The statistical probability of sustaining a serious injury is very high if one decides to climb a very high mountain without proper mountaineering accouterments.
