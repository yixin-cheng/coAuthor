No doubt it will change some people's political views, but that is not something that affects the country. Because the people who have power are going to make sure they stay in power no matter what you think or how you vote. 

Remember the 2000 election and how that turned out. Gore clearly won, but the lection eventually turned on Republicans in suits descending on vote-counting taking place in Florida. The Supreme Court handed the presidency to George W. Bush in spite of him losing, because the powerful few wanted a war in the Mideast, which is what they eventually got.

The idea that people have a duty to follow the news presupposes that anything would be different about the world if they do. No doubt it will change some people's political views, but that is not something that affects the country. Because the people who have power are going to make sure they stay in power no matter what you think or how you vote. 

Remember the 2000 election and how that turned out. Gore clearly won, but the lection eventually turned on Republicans in suits descending on vote-counting taking place in Florida. The Supreme Court handed the presidency to George W. Bush in spite of him losing, because the powerful few wanted a war in the Mideast, which is what they eventually got.

Why do red states have more political power than the blue states although they contain far less people? Because it's not about red and blue, it's about the Republican powerful getting what they want. They own the votes in the electoral college and they own the Supreme Court. The rest of the nation doesn't stand a chance, no matter how well-informed they think they are.

The last election showed how this works. Biden won, but Trump and his acolytes were almost able to reverse the lection through lies, manipulation, and finding Republican Senators who were willing to refuse to certify electors in spite of what the constitution says. Were it not for a Washington riot which disrupted their plans, Trump would be dictator today.
This this is the real news that people need to know about.

Because the people who have power are going to make sure they stay in power no matter what you think or how you vote. 

Remember the 2000 election and how that turned out. Gore clearly won, but the election eventually turned on Republicans in suits descending on vote-counting taking place in Florida. The Supreme Court handed the presidency to George W. Bush in spite of him losing, because the powerful few wanted a war in the Mideast, which is what they eventually got.

Why do red states have more political power than the blue states although they contain far less people? Because it's not about red and blue, it's about the Republican powerful getting what they want. They own the votes in the electoral college and they own the Supreme Court. The rest of the nation doesn't stand a chance, no matter how well-informed they think they are.

The last election showed how this works. Biden won, but Trump and his acolytes were almost able to reverse the lection through lies, manipulation, and finding Republican Senators who were willing to refuse to certify electors in spite of what the constitution says. Were it not for a Washington riot which disrupted their plans, Trump would be dictator today.
This this is the real news that people need to know about.
 They need to know how the government really works. It works by a small number of people making sure that whatever the voters want doesn't make any difference.",1522,[],2,2,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1370

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

The idea that people have a duty to follow the news presupposes that anything would be different about the country if they do. No doubt it will change some people's political views, but that is not something that affects the country. Because the people who have power are going to make sure they stay in power no matter what you think or how you vote.
