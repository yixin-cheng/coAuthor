In my opinion, the most offensive stereotype is the portrayal of Native Americans. I have seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans are portrayed as savages, uncivilized, and/or unintelligent. Later-dated portrayals show them as drunks, jean jacket-clad, greasy, no-lifers waiting on the side of the road for the next handout. 
I have also seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans arnd their culture ae portrayed as wall-ise, spiritual, and/or mystical.
 They are often shown as the ""keepers of the earth"" or the ""keepers of the balance"",  the ""keepers of the ancient wisdom.""

This fetishization is damaging. People are not dichotomous. There were periods of time where tribes would murder and scalp their enemies. They would eat the heart of their foes. here were also periods of time where tribes would treat their enemies with respect and kindness.

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotype is the portrayal of Native Americans. I have seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans are portrayed as savages, uncivilized, and/or unintelligent. Later-dated portrayals show them as drunks, jean jacket-clad, greasy, no-lifers waiting on the side of the road for the next handout. 
I have also seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans arnd their culture ae portrayed as wall-ise, spiritual, and/or mystical.
 They are often shown as the ""keepers of the earth"" or the ""keepers of the balance"",  the ""keepers of the ancient wisdom.""

This fetishization is damaging. People are not dichotomous. There were periods of time where tribes would murder and scalp their enemies. They would eat the heart of their foes. here were also periods of time where tribes would treat their enemies with respect and kindness.


Native Americans have doctors, scientists, lawyers, and engineers. They also have hobos and lazy individuals, the same as any other race.

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotype is the portrayal of Native Americans. I have seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans are portrayed as savages, uncivilized, and/or unintelligent. Later-dated portrayals show them as drunks, jean jacket-clad, greasy, no-lifers waiting on the side of the road for the next handout. 
I have also seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans arnd their culture ae portrayed as wall-ise, spiritual, and/or mystical.

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotype is the portrayal of Native Americans. I have seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans are portrayed as savages, uncivilized, and/or unintelligent. Later-dated portrayals show them as drunks, jean jacket-clad, greasy, no-lifers waiting on the side of the road for the next handout. 
I have also seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans arnd their culture ae portrayed as wall-ise, spiritual, and/or mystical.
 They are often shown as the ""keepers of the earth"" or the ""keepers of the balance"",  the ""keepers of the ancient wisdom.""

This fetishization is damaging. People are not dichotomous. There were periods of time where tribes would murder and scalp their enemies. They would eat the heart of their foes. here were also periods of time where tribes would treat their enemies with respect and kindness.


Native Americans have doctors, scientists, lawyers, and engineers. They also have hobos and lazy individuals, the same as any other race.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotype is the portrayal of Native Americans. I have seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans are portrayed as savages, uncivilized, and/or unintelligent. Later-dated portrayals show them as drunks, jean jacket-clad, greasy, no-lifers waiting on the side of the road for the next handout. 
I have also seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans arnd their culture ae portrayed as wall-ise, spiritual, and/or mystical.
 They are often shown as the ""keepers of the earth"" or the ""keepers of the balance"",  the ""keepers of the ancient wisdom.""
