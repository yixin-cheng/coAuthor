In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.
 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.
 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open.

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.

Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun.

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.
 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun. 
I think technology has the potential to make dating better, but it also has the potential to make it worse.
 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person. I've had a few uncomfortable experiences, where the date was just not enjoyable for either of us. We ju",1690,[],1,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1079

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.
 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun. 
I think technology has the potential to make dating better, but it also has the potential to make it worse.
 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person.

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.
 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun.

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.
 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun.

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.
 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun. 
I think technology has the potential to make dating better, but it also has the potential to make it worse.
 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person. I've had a few uncomfortable experiences, where the date was just not enjoyable for either of us. We just didn't click. I think that's a risk you take with any dating experience, but I think it's a risk worth taking.

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.
 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open.

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.
 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun. 
I think technology has the potential to make dating better, but it also has the potential to make it worse.
 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person. I've had a few uncomfortable experiences, where the date was just not enjoyable for either of us. We just didn't click. I think that's a risk you take with any dating experience, but I think it's a risk worth taking.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun.

 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person. I've had a few uncomfortable experiences, where the date was just not enjoyable for either of us. We just didn't click.

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.
 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun. 
I think technology has the potential to make dating better, but it also has the potential to make it worse.
 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person. I've had a few uncomfortable experiences, where the date was just not enjoyable for either of us. We just didn't click. I think that's a risk you take with any dating experience, but I think it's a risk worth taking.

I think that a lot of people have already used dating apps. I'm quite sure that a lot more people will utilize them in the future. They are convenient, exciting and efficient. Even when dates don't work out, the experience",2027,[],0,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1343

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.
 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun.

 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun. 
I think technology has the potential to make dating better, but it also has the potential to make it worse.
 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person. I've had a few uncomfortable experiences, where the date was just not enjoyable for either of us. We just didn't click. I think that's a risk you take with any dating experience, but I think it's a risk worth taking.

I think that a lot of people have already used dating apps. I'm quite sure that a lot more people will utilize them in the future. They are convenient, exciting and efficient. Even when dates don't work out, the experience is still a",2038,[],0,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1372

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.
 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun. 
I think technology has the potential to make dating better, but it also has the potential to make it worse.
 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person.

 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun. 
I think technology has the potential to make dating better, but it also has the potential to make it worse.
 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person. I've had a few uncomfortable experiences, where the date was just not enjoyable for either of us. We just didn't click. I think that's a risk you take with any dating experience, but I think it's a risk worth taking.

I think that a lot of people have already used dating apps. I'm quite sure that a lot more people will utilize them in the future. They are convenient, exciting and efficient. Even when dates don't work out, the experience is still an adventure. Even if it doesn",2067,[],0,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1401

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.
 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun.

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.
 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun. 
I think technology has the potential to make dating better, but it also has the potential to make it worse.
 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person. I've had a few uncomfortable experiences, where the date was just not enjoyable for either of us. We just didn't click. I think that's a risk you take with any dating experience, but I think it's a risk worth taking.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.
 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun. 
I think technology has the potential to make dating better, but it also has the potential to make it worse.
 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person. I've had a few uncomfortable experiences, where the date was just not enjoyable for either of us. We just didn't click. I think that's a risk you take with any dating experience, but I think it's a risk worth taking.

I think that a lot of people have already used dating apps. I'm quite sure that a lot more people will utilize them in the future. They are convenient, exciting and efficient. Even when dates don't work out, the experience is still an adventure. Even if it doesn't blossom into a romantic encounter, meeti",2110,[],0,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1444

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.
 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun. 
I think technology has the potential to make dating better, but it also has the potential to make it worse.
 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person. I've had a few uncomfortable experiences, where the date was just not enjoyable for either of us. We just didn't click. I think that's a risk you take with any dating experience, but I think it's a risk worth taking.

I think that a lot of people have already used dating apps. I'm quite sure that a lot more people will utilize them in the future. They are convenient, exciting and efficient. Even when dates don't work out, the experience is still an adventure. Even if it doesn't blossom into a romantic encounter, meeting new people ",2124,[],0,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1458

 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun. 
I think technology has the potential to make dating better, but it also has the potential to make it worse.
 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person. I've had a few uncomfortable experiences, where the date was just not enjoyable for either of us. We just didn't click. I think that's a risk you take with any dating experience, but I think it's a risk worth taking.

I think that a lot of people have already used dating apps. I'm quite sure that a lot more people will utilize them in the future. They are convenient, exciting and efficient. Even when dates don't work out, the experience is still an adventure. Even if it doesn't blossom into a romantic encounter, meeting new people is usually a g",2138,[],0,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1472

 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun. 
I think technology has the potential to make dating better, but it also has the potential to make it worse.
 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person. I've had a few uncomfortable experiences, where the date was just not enjoyable for either of us. We just didn't click. I think that's a risk you take with any dating experience, but I think it's a risk worth taking.

I think that a lot of people have already used dating apps. I'm quite sure that a lot more people will utilize them in the future. They are convenient, exciting and efficient.

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.
 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun. 
I think technology has the potential to make dating better, but it also has the potential to make it worse.
 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person. I've had a few uncomfortable experiences, where the date was just not enjoyable for either of us. We just didn't click. I think that's a risk you take with any dating experience, but I think it's a risk worth taking.

I think that a lot of people have already used dating apps. I'm quite sure that a lot more people will utilize them in the future. They are convenient, exciting and efficient. Even when dates don't work out, the experience is still an adventure. Even if it doesn't blossom into a romantic encounter, meeting new people is usually a growth experience.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.
 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun. 
I think technology has the potential to make dating better, but it also has the potential to make it worse.
 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person. I've had a few uncomfortable experiences, where the date was just not enjoyable for either of us. We just didn't click. I think that's a risk you take with any dating experience, but I think it's a risk worth taking.

I think that a lot of people have already used dating apps. I'm quite sure that a lot more people will utilize them in the future. They are convenient, exciting and efficient. Even when dates don't work out, the experience is still an adventure. Even if it doesn't blossom into a romantic encounter, meeting new people is usually a growth experience.

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.
 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun. 
I think technology has the potential to make dating better, but it also has the potential to make it worse.
 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person. I've had a few uncomfortable experiences, where the date was just not enjoyable for either of us. We just didn't click. I think that's a risk you take with any dating experience, but I think it's a risk worth taking.

 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person.

I think that a lot of people have already used dating apps. I'm quite sure that a lot more people will utilize them in the future. They are convenient, exciting and efficient.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well.

 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun. 
I think technology has the potential to make dating better, but it also has the potential to make it worse.
 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person. I've had a few uncomfortable experiences, where the date was just not enjoyable for either of us. We just didn't click. I think that's a risk you take with any dating experience, but I think it's a risk worth taking.

I think that a lot of people have already used dating apps. I'm quite sure that a lot more people will utilize them in the future. They are convenient, exciting and efficient. Even when dates don't work out, the experience is still an adventure. Even if it doesn't blossom into a romantic encounter, meeting new people is usually a growth experience.

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.
 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun. 
I think technology has the potential to make dating better, but it also has the potential to make it worse.
 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person. I've had a few uncomfortable experiences, where the date was just not enjoyable for either of us. We just didn't click. I think that's a risk you take with any dating experience, but I think it's a risk worth taking.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun. 
I think technology has the potential to make dating better, but it also has the potential to make it worse.
 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person. I've had a few uncomfortable experiences, where the date was just not enjoyable for either of us. We just didn't click.

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.
 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun. 
I think technology has the potential to make dating better, but it also has the potential to make it worse.
 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person. I've had a few uncomfortable experiences, where the date was just not enjoyable for either of us. We just didn't click. I think that's a risk you take with any dating experience, but I think it's a risk worth taking.

 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun. 
I think technology has the potential to make dating better, but it also has the potential to make it worse.
 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person. I've had a few uncomfortable experiences, where the date was just not enjoyable for either of us. We just didn't click. I think that's a risk you take with any dating experience, but I think it's a risk worth taking.

I think that a lot of people have already used dating apps. I'm quite sure that a lot more people will utilize them in the future. They are convenient, exciting and efficient. Even when dates don't work out, the experience is still an adventure. Even if it doesn't blossom into a romantic encounter, meeting new people is usually a growth experience.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun.
