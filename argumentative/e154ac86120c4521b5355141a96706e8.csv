Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend.

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable.

Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable.

Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competiti",1976,[],2,2,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1054

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable.

Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited.

The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable.

The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited. Once a sport is established, records would have to be kept of injuries and deaths, so that the risk could be calculated. A sport that exceeds the threshold, would be required to make changes to reduce the risk, or else it would be banned. This would apply to existing sports, as well as new ones.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited. Once a sport is established, records would have to be kept of injuries and deaths, so that the risk could be calculated. A sport that exceeds the threshold, would be required to make changes to reduce the risk, or else it would be banned. This would apply to existing sports, as well as new ones.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited. Once a sport is established, records would have to be kept of injuries and deaths, so that the risk could be calculated. A sport that exceeds the threshold, would be required to make changes to reduce the risk, or else it would be banned. This would apply to existing sports, as well as new ones.

Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited. Once a sport is established, records would have to be kept of injuries and deaths, so that the risk could be calculated. A sport that exceeds the threshold, would be required to make changes to reduce the risk, or else it would be banned. This would apply to existing sports, as well as new ones.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited. Once a sport is established, records would have to be kept of injuries and deaths, so that the risk could be calculated. A sport that exceeds the threshold, would be required to make changes to reduce the risk, or else it would be banned. This would apply to existing sports, as well as new ones.

The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited. Once a sport is established, records would have to be kept of injuries and deaths, so that the risk could be calculated. A sport that exceeds the threshold, would be required to make changes to reduce the risk, or else it would be banned. This would apply to existing sports, as well as new ones.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited. Once a sport is established, records would have to be kept of injuries and deaths, so that the risk could be calculated. A sport that exceeds the threshold, would be required to make changes to reduce the risk, or else it would be banned. This would apply to existing sports, as well as new ones.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited. Once a sport is established, records would have to be kept of injuries and deaths, so that the risk could be calculated. A sport that exceeds the threshold, would be required to make changes to reduce the risk, or else it would be banned. This would apply to existing sports, as well as new ones.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited. Once a sport is established, records would have to be kept of injuries and deaths, so that the risk could be calculated. A sport that exceeds the threshold, would be required to make changes to reduce the risk, or else it would be banned. This would apply to existing sports, as well as new ones.

Sports are an inherently dangerous activity, and there is no way to eliminate all risk. However, it seems absurd to attempt to ban all dangerous sports, as some people have suggested, because this would begin a disturbing trend of government interference in our lives.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited. Once a sport is established, records would have to be kept of injuries and deaths, so that the risk could be calculated. A sport that exceeds the threshold, would be required to make changes to reduce the risk, or else it would be banned. This would apply to existing sports, as well as new ones.

Sports are an inherently dangerous activity, and there is no way to eliminate all risk. However, it seems absurd to attempt to ban all dangerous sports, as some people have suggested, because this would begin a disturbing trend of government interference in our lives.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited. Once a sport is established, records would have to be kept of injuries and deaths, so that the risk could be calculated. A sport that exceeds the threshold, would be required to make changes to reduce the risk, or else it would be banned. This would apply to existing sports, as well as new ones.

Sports are an inherently dangerous activity, and there is no way to eliminate all risk.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited. Once a sport is established, records would have to be kept of injuries and deaths, so that the risk could be calculated. A sport that exceeds the threshold, would be required to make changes to reduce the risk, or else it would be banned. This would apply to existing sports, as well as new ones.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited. Once a sport is established, records would have to be kept of injuries and deaths, so that the risk could be calculated. A sport that exceeds the threshold, would be required to make changes to reduce the risk, or else it would be banned. This would apply to existing sports, as well as new ones.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited. Once a sport is established, records would have to be kept of injuries and deaths, so that the risk could be calculated.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited. Once a sport is established, records would have to be kept of injuries and deaths, so that the risk could be calculated. A sport that exceeds the threshold, would be required to make changes to reduce the risk, or else it would be banned. This would apply to existing sports, as well as new ones.

Sports are an inherently dangerous activity, and there is no way to eliminate all risk. However, it seems absurd to attempt to ban all dangerous sports, as some people have suggested, because this would begin a disturbing trend of government interference in our lives. The best approach is a rational, common-sense, empirical one, aiming to set a reasonable limit on the acceptable level of risk, and then to require that all sports stay below that level.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited. Once a sport is established, records would have to be kept of injuries and deaths, so that the risk could be calculated. A sport that exceeds the threshold, would be required to make changes to reduce the risk, or else it would be banned. This would apply to existing sports, as well as new ones.

Sports are an inherently dangerous activity, and there is no way to eliminate all risk. However, it seems absurd to attempt to ban all dangerous sports, as some people have suggested, because this would begin a disturbing trend of government interference in our lives.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend.

Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited. Once a sport is established, records would have to be kept of injuries and deaths, so that the risk could be calculated. A sport that exceeds the threshold, would be required to make changes to reduce the risk, or else it would be banned. This would apply to existing sports, as well as new ones.

Sports are an inherently dangerous activity, and there is no way to eliminate all risk. However, it seems absurd to attempt to ban all dangerous sports, as some people have suggested, because this would begin a disturbing trend of government interference in our lives. The best approach is a rational, common-sense, empirical one, aiming to set a reasonable limit on the acceptable level of risk, and then to require that all sports stay below that level. This will balance the desire for personal liberty, with ",2816,[],2,2,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1630

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?
