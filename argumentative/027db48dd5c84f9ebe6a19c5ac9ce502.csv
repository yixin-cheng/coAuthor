In my opinion, keeping up with the news is very important. I think everyone should have some background knowledge about what's going on in the world, even if they don't follow it closely. It helps to shape your world view and helps you form your own opinions. 

This pandemic is a perfect example of what happens when certain people do not follow the news. Those who don't follow the news are often in denial of realities like this. People have denied that coronavirus exists despite the news telling them otherwise. Some people even seem proud to ignore news unless it is conspiracy theory based. That's why many Republicans believe that Donald Trump won the 2020 election. They only listen to news that is extreme and doesn't report the actual truth or they don't listen to the news at all and just listen to their friends. These people are proud to be American but they are not doing their duty to be informed.

This pandemic is a perfect example of what happens when certain people do not follow the news. Those who don't follow the news are often in denial of realities like this.

That's why many Republicans believe that Donald Trump won the 2020 election. They only listen to news that is extreme and doesn't report the actual truth or they don't listen to the news at all and just listen to their friends. These people are proud to be American but they are not doing their duty to be informed.

Morning shows for example tend to be more sugar coated. People watch it to stay informed but aren't getting as much information.

This pandemic is a perfect example of what happens when certain people do not follow the news. Those who don't follow the news are often in denial of realities like this. People have denied that coronavirus exists despite the news telling them otherwise. Some people even seem proud to ignore news unless it is conspiracy theory based. That's why many Republicans believe that Donald Trump won the 2020 election. They only listen to news that is extreme and doesn't report the actual truth or they don't listen to the news at all and just listen to their friends. These people are proud to be American but they are not doing their duty to be informed. 

I think it's too vague to just say people keep up with the news or not. Even if you do watch the news, you may not be watching a very informative program. Morning shows for example tend to be more sugar coated. People watch it to stay informed but aren't getting as much information. Often times you need to watch national news to hear what is really going on in out country. Sometimes people want to avoid such grim news so they prefer the friendly morning show format. However they need to know what is happening. 
If people do not know what’s happening in their own country, they cannot hold their leaders accountable.

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is very important. I think everyone should have some background knowledge about what's going on in the world, even if they don't follow it closely. It helps to shape your world view and helps you form your own opinions. 

This pandemic is a perfect example of what happens when certain people do not follow the news. Those who don't follow the news are often in denial of realities like this. People have denied that coronavirus exists despite the news telling them otherwise. Some people even seem proud to ignore news unless it is conspiracy theory based. That's why many Republicans believe that Donald Trump won the 2020 election. They only listen to news that is extreme and doesn't report the actual truth or they don't listen to the news at all and just listen to their friends. These people are proud to be American but they are not doing their duty to be informed. 

I think it's too vague to just say people keep up with the news or not. Even if you do watch the news, you may not be watching a very informative program. Morning shows for example tend to be more sugar coated. People watch it to stay informed but aren't getting as much information. Often times you need to watch national news to hear what is really going on in out country. Sometimes people want to avoid such grim news so they prefer the friendly morning show format. However they need to know what is happening.

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is very important. I think everyone should have some background knowledge about what's going on in the world, even if they don't follow it closely. It helps to shape your world view and helps you form your own opinions. 

This pandemic is a perfect example of what happens when certain people do not follow the news. Those who don't follow the news are often in denial of realities like this. People have denied that coronavirus exists despite the news telling them otherwise. Some people even seem proud to ignore news unless it is conspiracy theory based. That's why many Republicans believe that Donald Trump won the 2020 election. They only listen to news that is extreme and doesn't report the actual truth or they don't listen to the news at all and just listen to their friends. These people are proud to be American but they are not doing their duty to be informed. 

I think it's too vague to just say people keep up with the news or not. Even if you do watch the news, you may not be watching a very informative program. Morning shows for example tend to be more sugar coated. People watch it to stay informed but aren't getting as much information. Often times you need to watch national news to hear what is really going on in out country. Sometimes people want to avoid such grim news so they prefer the friendly morning show format. However they need to know what is happening. 
If people do not know what’s happening in their own country, they cannot hold their leaders accountable.

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is very important. I think everyone should have some background knowledge about what's going on in the world, even if they don't follow it closely. It helps to shape your world view and helps you form your own opinions. 

This pandemic is a perfect example of what happens when certain people do not follow the news. Those who don't follow the news are often in denial of realities like this. People have denied that coronavirus exists despite the news telling them otherwise. Some people even seem proud to ignore news unless it is conspiracy theory based. That's why many Republicans believe that Donald Trump won the 2020 election. They only listen to news that is extreme and doesn't report the actual truth or they don't listen to the news at all and just listen to their friends. These people are proud to be American but they are not doing their duty to be informed. 

I think it's too vague to just say people keep up with the news or not. Even if you do watch the news, you may not be watching a very informative program. Morning shows for example tend to be more sugar coated. People watch it to stay informed but aren't getting as much information. Often times you need to watch national news to hear what is really going on in out country. Sometimes people want to avoid such grim news so they prefer the friendly morning show format. However they need to know what is happening. 
If people do not know what’s happening in their own country, they cannot hold their leaders accountable.

This pandemic is a perfect example of what happens when certain people do not follow the news. Those who don't follow the news are often in denial of realities like this. People have denied that coronavirus exists despite the news telling them otherwise. Some people even seem proud to ignore news unless it is conspiracy theory based. That's why many Republicans believe that Donald Trump won the 2020 election. They only listen to news that is extreme and doesn't report the actual truth or they don't listen to the news at all and just listen to their friends. These people are proud to be American but they are not doing their duty to be informed. 

I think it's too vague to just say people keep up with the news or not. Even if you do watch the news, you may not be watching a very informative program. Morning shows for example tend to be more sugar coated. People watch it to stay informed but aren't getting as much information. Often times you need to watch national news to hear what is really going on in out country. Sometimes people want to avoid such grim news so they prefer the friendly morning show format. However they need to know what is happening. 
If people do not know what’s happening in their own country, they cannot hold their leaders accountable.

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is very important. I think everyone should have some background knowledge about what's going on in the world, even if they don't follow it closely. It helps to shape your world view and helps you form your own opinions. 

This pandemic is a perfect example of what happens when certain people do not follow the news. Those who don't follow the news are often in denial of realities like this. People have denied that coronavirus exists despite the news telling them otherwise. Some people even seem proud to ignore news unless it is conspiracy theory based. That's why many Republicans believe that Donald Trump won the 2020 election. They only listen to news that is extreme and doesn't report the actual truth or they don't listen to the news at all and just listen to their friends. These people are proud to be American but they are not doing their duty to be informed. 

I think it's too vague to just say people keep up with the news or not. Even if you do watch the news, you may not be watching a very informative program. Morning shows for example tend to be more sugar coated. People watch it to stay informed but aren't getting as much information. Often times you need to watch national news to hear what is really going on in out country. Sometimes people want to avoid such grim news so they prefer the friendly morning show format. However they need to know what is happening. 
If people do not know what’s happening in their own country, they cannot hold their leaders accountable.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is very important. I think everyone should have some background knowledge about what's going on in the world, even if they don't follow it closely. It helps to shape your world view and helps you form your own opinions. 

This pandemic is a perfect example of what happens when certain people do not follow the news. Those who don't follow the news are often in denial of realities like this. People have denied that coronavirus exists despite the news telling them otherwise. Some people even seem proud to ignore news unless it is conspiracy theory based. That's why many Republicans believe that Donald Trump won the 2020 election. They only listen to news that is extreme and doesn't report the actual truth or they don't listen to the news at all and just listen to their friends. These people are proud to be American but they are not doing their duty to be informed. 

I think it's too vague to just say people keep up with the news or not. Even if you do watch the news, you may not be watching a very informative program. Morning shows for example tend to be more sugar coated. People watch it to stay informed but aren't getting as much information. Often times you need to watch national news to hear what is really going on in out country. Sometimes people want to avoid such grim news so they prefer the friendly morning show format.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is very important. I think everyone should have some background knowledge about what's going on in the world, even if they don't follow it closely. It helps to shape your world view and helps you form your own opinions. 

This pandemic is a perfect example of what happens when certain people do not follow the news. Those who don't follow the news are often in denial of realities like this. People have denied that coronavirus exists despite the news telling them otherwise. Some people even seem proud to ignore news unless it is conspiracy theory based. That's why many Republicans believe that Donald Trump won the 2020 election. They only listen to news that is extreme and doesn't report the actual truth or they don't listen to the news at all and just listen to their friends. These people are proud to be American but they are not doing their duty to be informed. 

I think it's too vague to just say people keep up with the news or not. Even if you do watch the news, you may not be watching a very informative program. Morning shows for example tend to be more sugar coated. People watch it to stay informed but aren't getting as much information. Often times you need to watch national news to hear what is really going on in out country. Sometimes people want to avoid such grim news so they prefer the friendly morning show format. However they need to know what is happening. 
If people do not know what’s happening in their own country, they cannot hold their leaders accountable.
