In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to work and collaborate with others, how to be flexible and accommodating for unexpected obstacles or setbacks, and learning how to set goals to achieve alongside feasible plans in their daily lives. I think this is more important than learning facts in a textbook, which might be circumstantial and not useful in many applications, or grades that are given based on it which only serve to gauge performance in specific metrics. 

The most important thing that I have learned in school is being able to persevere and also confine in my abilities as well as the skills and expertise of others. It has helped me succeed many times, such as when I needed to write an report as well as lead a group presentation with individuals that I might not be too familiar with. Lacking a basic confidence in one's ability and or trust in others increases doubt, and can ultimately cause a decrease in performance. Throughout life, there will no doubt be unexpected situations or stressful periods of time that ultimately challenges a person. Learning how to handle these situations is crucial to ones success in school as well as later on in life. I know that believing in myself and others will help in my career and or other opportunities I experience in my life. Trust is critical in group situations, which I face a good portion at work. Without trust, cohesion is affected and you are forced to work individually when many tasks require the work efforts and skill set of others. For those reasons and more, I believe students benefit from a school experience as it helps them work well with others, to build self-confidence and their self-esteem along with the ability to confine in colleagues, friends, and other people they will encounter in life.
