In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. It is important to focus on both because they are both important.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. It is important to focus on both because they are both important. We should help animals because they are living creatures and they deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. Focus on either group helps improve the world. It's a positive force for change. 

Animals are more helpless than most humans. They cannot speak for themselves, so it is up to us to speak for them. Animals are also more innocent than humans. They do not have the ability to think about what they are doing. They have a purity only shared by human children. 
This innocence provides a clarity. When we help them, we know we are doing the right thing. 

This purity make violence against them wrong most of the time. We have a clear stance, ""this is wrong"", across races, creeds, religions.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. It is important to focus on both because they are both important. We should help animals because they are living creatures and they deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. Focus on either group helps improve the world. It's a positive force for change.

This innocence provides a clarity. When we help them, we know we are doing the right thing.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. It is important to focus on both because they are both important. We should help animals because they are living creatures and they deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. Focus on either group helps improve the world. It's a positive force for change. 

Animals are more helpless than most humans. They cannot speak for themselves, so it is up to us to speak for them. Animals are also more innocent than humans. They do not have the ability to think about what they are doing. They have a purity only shared by human children. 
This innocence provides a clarity. When we help them, we know we are doing the right thing. 

This purity make violence against them wrong most of the time. We have a clear stance, ""this is wrong"", across races, creeds, religions. 
Religions who stone their apostate adults usually recognize the purity, weakness, and dependence of children and dogs.  They can do no wrong because they don't know right and wrong, unlike adults who did wrong, and face the cons

People probably prefer their pet dog because of the bonds they have formed with it. They have spent time with it and have formed a relationship. They have seen it grow and learn. They care about it, while the foreign tourist is an unknown. 
It is also possible that people are more empathetic toward animals because they have been domesticated.
 They have been bred to be more human-like and friendly. They have been bred to be more loyal and more obedient.  Humans know what to expect from their pets.  They know most animals can't or won't hurt them like other humans can.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. It is important to focus on both because they are both important. We should help animals because they are living creatures and they deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. Focus on either group helps improve the world. It's a positive force for change.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. It is important to focus on both because they are both important.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. It is important to focus on both because they are both important. We should help animals because they are living creatures and they deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. Focus on either group helps improve the world. It's a positive force for change. 

Animals are more helpless than most humans. They cannot speak for themselves, so it is up to us to speak for them. Animals are also more innocent than humans. They do not have the ability to think about what they are doing. They have a purity only shared by human children. 
This innocence provides a clarity. When we help them, we know we are doing the right thing. 

This purity make violence against them wrong most of the time. We have a clear stance, ""this is wrong"", across races, creeds, religions. 
Religions who stone their apostate adults usually recognize the purity, weakness, and dependence of children and dogs.  They can do no wrong because they don't know right and wrong, unlike adults who knowingly did wrong, and face the consequences. 

People probably prefer their pet dog because of the bonds they have formed with it. They have spent time with it and have formed a relationship. They have seen it grow and learn. They care about it, while the foreign tourist is an unknown. ""Us vs. Them"" is deeply ingrained in our DNA. 
It is also possible that people are more empathetic toward animals because they have been domesticated.
 They have been bred to be more human-like and friendly. They have been bred to be more loyal and more obedient.  Humans know what to expect from their pets.  They know most animals can't or won't hurt them like other humans can.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. It is important to focus on both because they are both important.

People probably prefer their pet dog because of the bonds they have formed with it. They have spent time with it and have formed a relationship. They have seen it grow and learn. They care about it, while the foreign tourist is an unknown. ""Us vs. Them"" is deeply ingrained in our DNA. 
It is also possible that people are more empathetic toward animals because they have been domesticated.
 They have been bred to be more human-like and friendly. They have been bred to be more loyal and more obedient.  Humans know what to expect from their pets.  They know most animals can't or won't hurt them like other humans can.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. It is important to focus on both because they are both important. We should help animals because they are living creatures and they deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. Focus on either group helps improve the world. It's a positive force for change. 

Animals are more helpless than most humans. They cannot speak for themselves, so it is up to us to speak for them. Animals are also more innocent than humans. They do not have the ability to think about what they are doing. They have a purity only shared by human children. 
This innocence provides a clarity. When we help them, we know we are doing the right thing. 

This purity make violence against them wrong most of the time. We have a clear stance, ""this is wrong"", across races, creeds, religions.

People probably prefer their pet dog because of the bonds they have formed with it. They have spent time with it and have formed a relationship. They have seen it grow and learn. They care about it, while the foreign tourist is an unknown. ""Us vs. Them"" is deeply ingrained in our DNA. 
It is also possible that people are more empathetic toward animals because they have been domesticated.
 They have been bred to be more human-like and friendly. They have been bred to be more loyal and more obedient.  Humans know what to expect from their pets.  They know most animals can't or won't hurt them like other humans can.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. It is important to focus on both because they are both important.

Animals are more helpless than most humans. They cannot speak for themselves, so it is up to us to speak for them. Animals are also more innocent than humans. They do not have the ability to think about what they are doing. They have a purity only shared by human children.

This purity make violence against them wrong most of the time. We have a clear stance, ""this is wrong"", across races, creeds, religions.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. It is important to focus on both because they are both important. We should help animals because they are living creatures and they deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. Focus on either group helps improve the world. It's a positive force for change. 

Animals are more helpless than most humans. They cannot speak for themselves, so it is up to us to speak for them. Animals are also more innocent than humans. They do not have the ability to think about what they are doing. They have a purity only shared by human children. 
This innocence provides a clarity. When we help them, we know we are doing the right thing. 

This purity make violence against them wrong most of the time. We have a clear stance, ""this is wrong"", across races, creeds, religions. 
Religions who stone their apostate adults usually recognize the purity, weakness, and dependence of children and dogs.  They can do no wrong because they don't know right and wrong, unlike adults who knowingly did wrong, and face the consequences. 

People probably prefer their pet dog because of the bonds they have formed with it. They have spent time with it and have formed a relationship. They have seen it grow and learn. They care about it, while the foreign tourist is an unknown. ""Us vs. Them"" is deeply ingrained in our DNA. 
It is also possible that people are more empathetic toward animals because they have been domesticated.
 They have been bred to be more human-like and friendly. They have been bred to be more loyal and more obedient.  Humans know what to expect from their pets.  They know most animals can't or won't hurt them like other humans can. 

Human interactions are more complex. With animals, it's easier to see wrongs and right them. This is perfectly fine,

We should help animals because they are living creatures and they deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. Focus on either group helps improve the world. It's a positive force for change. 

Animals are more helpless than most humans. They cannot speak for themselves, so it is up to us to speak for them. Animals are also more innocent than humans. They do not have the ability to think about what they are doing. They have a purity only shared by human children.

This purity make violence against them wrong most of the time. We have a clear stance, ""this is wrong"", across races, creeds, religions. 
Religions who stone their apostate adults usually recognize the purity, weakness, and dependence of children and dogs.  They can do no wrong because they don't know right and wrong, unlike adults who knowingly did wrong, and face the consequences. 

People probably prefer their pet dog because of the bonds they have formed with it. They have spent time with it and have formed a relationship. They have seen it grow and learn. They care about it, while the foreign tourist is an unknown. ""Us vs. Them"" is deeply ingrained in our DNA. 
It is also possible that people are more empathetic toward animals because they have been domesticated.
 They have been bred to be more human-like and friendly. They have been bred to be more loyal and more obedient.  Humans know what to expect from their pets.  They know most animals can't or won't hurt them like other humans can.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. It is important to focus on both because they are both important. We should help animals because they are living creatures and they deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. Focus on either group helps improve the world. It's a positive force for change. 

Animals are more helpless than most humans. They cannot speak for themselves, so it is up to us to speak for them. Animals are also more innocent than humans. They do not have the ability to think about what they are doing. They have a purity only shared by human children. 
This innocence provides a clarity. When we help them, we know we are doing the right thing. 

This purity make violence against them wrong most of the time. We have a clear stance, ""this is wrong"", across races, creeds, religions. 
Religions who stone their apostate adults usually recognize the purity, weakness, and dependence of children and dogs.  They can do no wrong because they don't know right and wrong, unlike adults who knowingly did wrong, and face the consequences. 

People probably prefer their pet dog because of the bonds they have formed with it. They have spent time with it and have formed a relationship. They have seen it grow and learn. They care about it, while the foreign tourist is an unknown. ""Us vs. Them"" is deeply ingrained in our DNA. 
It is also possible that people are more empathetic toward animals because they have been domesticated.
 They have been bred to be more human-like and friendly. They have been bred to be more loyal and more obedient.  Humans know what to expect from their pets.  They know most animals can't or won't hurt them like other humans can. 

Human interactions are more complex. With animals, it's easier to see wrongs and right them. This is perfectly fine, a valiant effort on our behalf to make the world better for someo

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. It is important to focus on both because they are both important. We should help animals because they are living creatures and they deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. Focus on either group helps improve the world. It's a positive force for change. 

Animals are more helpless than most humans. They cannot speak for themselves, so it is up to us to speak for them. Animals are also more innocent than humans. They do not have the ability to think about what they are doing. They have a purity only shared by human children. 
This innocence provides a clarity. When we help them, we know we are doing the right thing. 

This purity make violence against them wrong most of the time. We have a clear stance, ""this is wrong"", across races, creeds, religions. 
Religions who stone their apostate adults usually recognize the purity, weakness, and dependence of children and dogs.  They can do no wrong because they don't know right and wrong, unlike adults who knowingly did wrong, and face the consequences. 

People probably prefer their pet dog because of the bonds they have formed with it. They have spent time with it and have formed a relationship. They have seen it grow and learn. They care about it, while the foreign tourist is an unknown. ""Us vs. Them"" is deeply ingrained in our DNA. 
It is also possible that people are more empathetic toward animals because they have been domesticated.
 They have been bred to be more human-like and friendly. They have been bred to be more loyal and more obedient.  Humans know what to expect from their pets.  They know most animals can't or won't hurt them like other humans can.

Animals are more helpless than most humans. They cannot speak for themselves, so it is up to us to speak for them. Animals are also more innocent than humans. They do not have the ability to think about what they are doing. They have a purity shared only by human children. 
This innocence provides a clarity. When we help them, we know we are doing the right thing. 

This purity make violence against them wrong most of the time. We have a clear stance, ""this is wrong"", across races, creeds, religions. 
Even religions who stone their apostate adults usually recognize the purity, weakness, and dependence of children and dogs.  They can do no wrong because they don't know right and wrong, unlike adults who knowingly did wrong, and face the consequences. 

People probably prefer their pet dog because of the bonds they have formed with it. They have spent time with it and have formed a relationship. They have seen it grow and learn. They care about it, while the foreign tourist is an unknown. ""Us vs. Them"" is deeply ingrained in our DNA. 
It is also possible that people are more empathetic toward animals because they have been domesticated.
 They have been bred to be more human-like and friendly. They have been bred to be more loyal and more obedient.  Humans know what to expect from their pets.  They know most animals can't or won't hurt them like other humans can. 

Human interactions are more complex. With animal cruelty, it's easier to see wrongs, and right them. This is perfectly fine, a valiant effort on our behalf to make the world better for someone, human or animal.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?
