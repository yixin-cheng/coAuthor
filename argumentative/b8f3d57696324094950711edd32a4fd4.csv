In my opinion, there's been stereotypes used for so long that we're kind of used to them. I don't think they're offensive, but I do think they're annoying. Most gay films for example are just not for me. I've watched some with some friends. They assume I'll like them because of my sexuality. However, I find the characters to be pretty stereotypical. I just can't relate. I guess other people can though. I can respect that at least.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there's been stereotypes used for so long that we're kind of used to them. I don't think they're offensive, but I do think they're annoying. Most gay films for example are just not for me. I've watched some with some friends. They assume I'll like them because of my sexuality. However, I find the characters to be pretty stereotypical. I just can't relate. I guess other people can though. I can respect that at least.

Every gender, race and sexuality has been stereotyped. I think it's just a matter of whether or not you can relate to the character. If you can, you can overlook the stereotype. If you can't, it's annoying. One example of stereotypes is Too Wong Foo, thanks for everything. That movie has many stereotypical characters and elements. However, it's a fun movie so you can look past it. Many straight people who typically feel uncomfortable watching such movies enjoyed it for that reason.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there's been stereotypes used for so long that we're kind of used to them. I don't think they're offensive, but I do think they're annoying. Most gay films for example are just not for me. I've watched some with some friends. They assume I'll like them because of my sexuality. However, I find the characters to be pretty stereotypical. I just can't relate. I guess other people can though. I can respect that at least.

Every gender, race and sexuality has been stereotyped. I think it's just a matter of whether or not you can relate to the character. If you can, you can overlook the stereotype. If you can't, it's annoying. One example of stereotypes is Too Wong Foo, thanks for everything. That movie has many stereotypical characters and elements. However, it's a fun movie so you can look past it. Many straight people who typically feel uncomfortable watching such movies enjoyed it for that reason.

In my opinion, there's been stereotypes used for so long that we're kind of used to them. I don't think they're offensive, but I do think they're annoying.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there's been stereotypes used for so long that we're kind of used to them. I don't think they're offensive, but I do think they're annoying. Most gay films for example are just not for me. I've watched some with some friends. They assume I'll like them because of my sexuality. However, I find the characters to be pretty stereotypical. I just can't relate. I guess other people can though. I can respect that at least.

Every gender, race and sexuality has been stereotyped. I think it's just a matter of whether or not you can relate to the character. If you can, you can overlook the stereotype. If you can't, it's annoying. One example of stereotypes is Too Wong Foo, thanks for everything. That movie has many stereotypical characters and elements. However, it's a fun movie so you can look past it. Many straight people who typically feel uncomfortable watching such movies enjoyed it for that reason.

Most gay films for example are just not for me. I've watched some with some friends. They assume I'll like them because of my sexuality. However, I find the characters to be pretty stereotypical.

Every gender, race and sexuality has been stereotyped. I think it's just a matter of whether or not you can relate to the character. If you can, you can overlook the stereotype. If you can't, it's annoying. One example of stereotypes is Too Wong Foo, thanks for everything. That movie has many stereotypical characters and elements. However, it's a fun movie so you can look past it. Many straight people who typically feel uncomfortable watching such movies enjoyed it for that reason.

Most gay films for example are just not for me. I've watched some with some friends. They assume I'll like them because of my sexuality. However, I find the characters to be pretty stereotypical. I just can't relate. I guess other people can though. I can respect that at least.

Every gender, race and sexuality has been stereotyped. I think it's just a matter of whether or not you can relate to the character. If you can, you can overlook the stereotype. If you can't, it's annoying. One example of stereotypes is Too Wong Foo, thanks for everything. That movie has many stereotypical characters and elements. However, it's a fun movie so you can look past it. Many straight people who typically feel uncomfortable watching such movies enjoyed it for that reason. 
What is the Most Offensive Stereotype?
 I think people would say it is a racist stereotype. I don't think it's the most offensive. Many comedies use that as a setup for shows or for jokes. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.

In my opinion, there's been stereotypes used for so long that we're kind of used to them. I don't think they're offensive, but I do think they're annoying. Most gay films for example are just not for me. I've watched some with some friends. They assume I'll like them because of my sexuality. However, I find the characters to be pretty stereotypical. I just can't relate. I guess other people can though. I can respect that at least.

Every gender, race and sexuality has been stereotyped. I think it's just a matter of whether or not you can relate to the character. If you can, you can overlook the stereotype. If you can't, it's annoying. One example of stereotypes is Too Wong Foo, thanks for everything. That movie has many stereotypical characters and elements. However, it's a fun movie so you can look past it. Many straight people who typically feel uncomfortable watching such movies enjoyed it for that reason.

In my opinion, there's been stereotypes used for so long that we're kind of used to them. I don't think they're offensive, but I do think they're annoying. Most gay films for example are just not for me. I've watched some with some friends. They assume I'll like them because of my sexuality. However, I find the characters to be pretty stereotypical. I just can't relate. I guess other people can though. I can respect that at least.

Every gender, race and sexuality has been stereotyped. I think it's just a matter of whether or not you can relate to the character. If you can, you can overlook the stereotype. If you can't, it's annoying. One example of stereotypes is Too Wong Foo, thanks for everything. That movie has many stereotypical characters and elements. However, it's a fun movie so you can look past it. Many straight people who typically feel uncomfortable watching such movies enjoyed it for that reason. 
What is the Most Offensive Stereotype?
 I think people would say it is a racist stereotype. I don't think it's the most offensive. Many comedies use that as a setup for shows or for jokes. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.

In my opinion, there's been stereotypes used for so long that we're kind of used to them. I don't think they're offensive, but I do think they're annoying. Most gay films for example are just not for me. I've watched some with some friends. They assume I'll like them because of my sexuality. However, I find the characters to be pretty stereotypical. I just can't relate. I guess other people can though. I can respect that at least.

Every gender, race and sexuality has been stereotyped. I think it's just a matter of whether or not you can relate to the character. If you can, you can overlook the stereotype. If you can't, it's annoying. One example of stereotypes is Too Wong Foo, thanks for everything. That movie has many stereotypical characters and elements. However, it's a fun movie so you can look past it. Many straight people who typically feel uncomfortable watching such movies enjoyed it for that reason. 
What is the Most Offensive Stereotype?
 I think people would say it is a racist stereotype. I don't think it's the most offensive. Many comedies use that as a setup for shows or for jokes. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.

In my opinion, there's been stereotypes used for so long that we're kind of used to them. I don't think they're offensive, but I do think they're annoying. Most gay films for example are just not for me. I've watched some with some friends. They assume I'll like them because of my sexuality. However, I find the characters to be pretty stereotypical. I just can't relate. I guess other people can though. I can respect that at least.

Every gender, race and sexuality has been stereotyped. I think it's just a matter of whether or not you can relate to the character. If you can, you can overlook the stereotype. If you can't, it's annoying. One example of stereotypes is Too Wong Foo, thanks for everything. That movie has many stereotypical characters and elements. However, it's a fun movie so you can look past it. Many straight people who typically feel uncomfortable watching such movies enjoyed it for that reason. 
What is the Most Offensive Stereotype?
 I think people would say it is a racist stereotype. I don't think it's the most offensive. Many comedies use that as a setup for shows or for jokes. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. 

If you go into movies with an open mind then you probably won't be offended. I personally rarely get offended. I usually find it funny when people make fun of people like me. I don't think it's offensive. Some people will find it offensive obvio",1639,[],2,2,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1487

Most gay films for example are just not for me. I've watched some with some friends. They assume I'll like them because of my sexuality. However, I find the characters to be pretty stereotypical.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there's been stereotypes used for so long that we're kind of used to them. I don't think they're offensive, but I do think they're annoying. Most gay films for example are just not for me. I've watched some with some friends. They assume I'll like them because of my sexuality. However, I find the characters to be pretty stereotypical. I just can't relate. I guess other people can though. I can respect that at least.

Every gender, race and sexuality has been stereotyped. I think it's just a matter of whether or not you can relate to the character. If you can, you can overlook the stereotype. If you can't, it's annoying. One example of stereotypes is Too Wong Foo, thanks for everything. That movie has many stereotypical characters and elements. However, it's a fun movie so you can look past it. Many straight people who typically feel uncomfortable watching such movies enjoyed it for that reason.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there's been stereotypes used for so long that we're kind of used to them. I don't think they're offensive, but I do think they're annoying. Most gay films for example are just not for me. I've watched some with some friends. They assume I'll like them because of my sexuality. However, I find the characters to be pretty stereotypical. I just can't relate. I guess other people can though. I can respect that at least.

Every gender, race and sexuality has been stereotyped. I think it's just a matter of whether or not you can relate to the character. If you can, you can overlook the stereotype. If you can't, it's annoying. One example of stereotypes is Too Wong Foo, thanks for everything. That movie has many stereotypical characters and elements. However, it's a fun movie so you can look past it. Many straight people who typically feel uncomfortable watching such movies enjoyed it for that reason. 
What is the Most Offensive Stereotype?
 I think people would say it is a racist stereotype. I don't think it's the most offensive. Many comedies use that as a setup for shows or for jokes. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. 

If you go into movies with an open mind then you probably won't be offended. I personally rarely get offended. I usually find it funny when people make fun of people like me.
