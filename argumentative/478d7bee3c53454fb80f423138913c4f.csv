In my opinion, there is nothing worse than a cliché character. Too many times have I read a book that seems like the author just read one too many romance novels and decided to copy character profiles. 

he woman in these stories can only wear heels, she is always ready for her hair to be blown around at the slightest sign of wind ,abeautiful as a goddess, naïve nd
 a virgin. As she has been waiting for love, she also knows that gold diggers and poseurs don't deserve her undying love. 


he man in these stories is a boss, a millionaire, a hero, he must travel the world and have women fawning over
 him.  Her long awaited Prince Charming cannot be less than movie-star handsome, he must play ball with orphans, and he has to read books too. He will never think of the woman that holds his heart as an equal, but an object to be worshiped.

he woman in these stories can only wear heels, she is always ready for her hair to be blown around at the slightest sign of wind ,abeautiful as a goddess, naïve nd
 a virgin. As she has been waiting for love, she also knows that gold diggers and poseurs don't deserve her undying love. 


he man in these stories is a boss, a millionaire, a hero, he must travel the world and have women fawning over
 him.  Her long awaited Prince Charming cannot be less than movie-star handsome, he must play ball with orphans, and he has to read books too. He will never think of the woman that holds his heart as an equal, but an object to be worshiped.

Characters like this need to die already.! I want to read stories about women who are college educated--yes, I'm that type of woman, and I know plenty of others who are too.  want to read about men who are real--men who have flaws and dreams and those who don't need to be in the spotlight
. 
Characters like that aren't perfect, but they are real... and they can still have love in their lives.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there is nothing worse than reading ab a cliché character. Too many times have I read a book that seems like the author just read one too many romance novels and decided to copy character profiles. 

he woman in these stories can only wear heels, she is always ready for her hair to be blown around at the slightest sign of wind ,abeautiful as a goddess, naïve nd
 a virgin. As she has been waiting for love, she also knows that gold diggers and poseurs don't deserve her undying love. 


he man in these stories is a boss, a millionaire, a hero, he must travel the world and have women fawning over
 him.  Her long awaited Prince Charming cannot be less than movie-star handsome, he must play ball with orphans, and he has to read books too. He will never think of the woman that holds his heart as an equal, but an object to be worshiped.

Characters like this need to die already.! I want to read stories about women who are college educated--yes, I'm that type of woman, and I know plenty of others who are too.  want to read about men who are real--men who have flaws and dreams and those who don't need to be in the spotlight
. 
Characters like that aren't perfect, but they are real... and they can still have love in their lives.

In my opinion, there is nothing worse than reading about a cliché character. Too many times have I read a book that seems like the author just read one too many romance novels and decided to copy character profiles. 

he woman in these stories can only wear heels, she is always ready for her hair to be blown around at the slightest sign of wind ,abeautiful as a goddess, naïve nd
 a virgin. As she has been waiting for love, she also knows that gold diggers and poseurs don't deserve her undying love. 


he man in these stories is a boss, a millionaire, a hero, he must travel the world and have women fawning over
 him.  Her long awaited Prince Charming cannot be less than movie-star handsome, he must play ball with orphans, and he has to read books too. He will never think of the woman that holds his heart as an equal, but an object to be worshiped.

Characters like this need to die already.! I want to read stories about women who are college educated--yes, I'm that type of woman, and I know plenty of others who are too.  want to read about men who are real--men who have flaws and dreams and those who don't need to be in the spotlight
. haracters like that aren't perfect, but they are real... and they can still have love in their lives.
 

I'm personally not a fan of stories that are nothing but an instructional manual on how to be a woman, and how to be a man

In my opinion, there is nothing worse than reading about a cliché character. Too many times have I read a book that seems like the author just read one too many romance novels and decided to copy character profiles. 

he woman in these stories can only wear heels, she is always ready for her hair to be blown around at the slightest sign of wind ,abeautiful as a goddess, naïve nd
 a virgin. As she has been waiting for love, she also knows that gold diggers and poseurs don't deserve her undying love. 


he man in these stories is a boss, a millionaire, a hero, he must travel the world and have women fawning over
 him.  Her long awaited Prince Charming cannot be less than movie-star handsome, he must play ball with orphans, and he has to read books too. He will never think of the woman that holds his heart as an equal, but an object to be worshiped.

Characters like this need to die already.! I want to read stories about women who are college educated--yes, I'm that type of woman, and I know plenty of others who are too.  want to read about men who are real--men who have flaws and dreams and those who don't need to be in the spotlight
. haracters like that aren't perfect, but they are real... and they can still have love in their lives.
 

I'm personally not a fan of stories that are nothing but an instructional manual on how to be a woman, and how to be a man

he woman in these stories can only wear heels, she is always ready for her hair to be blown around at the slightest sign of wind ,abeautiful as a goddess, naïve nd

he man in these stories is a boss, a millionaire, a hero, he must travel the world and have women fawning over
 him.  Her long awaited Prince Charming cannot be less than movie-star handsome, he must play ball with orphans, and he has to read books too. He will never think of the woman that holds his heart as an equal, but an object to be worshiped.

he woman in these stories can only wear heels, she is always ready for her hair to be blown around at the slightest sign of wind ,abeautiful as a goddess, naïve nd
 a virgin. As she has been waiting for love, she also knows that gold diggers and poseurs don't deserve her undying love. 


he man in these stories is a boss, a millionaire, a hero, he must travel the world and have women fawning over
 him.  Her long awaited Prince Charming cannot be less than movie-star handsome, he must play ball with orphans, and he has to read books too. He will never think of the woman that holds his heart as an equal, but an object to be worshiped.

In my opinion, there is nothing worse than reading about a cliché character. Too many times have I read a book that seems like the author just read one too many romance novels and decided to copy character profiles. 

he woman in these stories can only wear heels, she is always ready for her hair to be blown around at the slightest sign of wind ,abeautiful as a goddess, naïve nd
 a virgin. As she has been waiting for love, she also knows that gold diggers and poseurs don't deserve her undying love. 


he man in these stories is a boss, a millionaire, a hero, he must travel the world and have women fawning over
 him.  Her long awaited Prince Charming cannot be less than movie-star handsome, he must play ball with orphans, and he has to read books too. He will never think of the woman that holds his heart as an equal, but an object to be worshiped.

Characters like this need to die already.! I want to read stories about women who are college educated--yes, I'm that type of woman, and I know plenty of others who are too.  want to read about men who are real--men who have flaws and dreams and those who don't need to be in the spotlight
. haracters like that aren't perfect, but they are real... and they can still have love in their lives.

In my opinion, there is nothing worse than reading about a cliché character. Too many times have I read a book that seems like the author just read one too many romance novels and decided to copy character profiles. 

he woman in these stories can only wear heels, she is always ready for her hair to be blown around at the slightest sign of wind ,abeautiful as a goddess, naïve nd
 a virgin. As she has been waiting for love, she also knows that gold diggers and poseurs don't deserve her undying love. 


he man in these stories is a boss, a millionaire, a hero, he must travel the world and have women fawning over
 him.  Her long awaited Prince Charming cannot be less than movie-star handsome, he must play ball with orphans, and he has to read books too. He will never think of the woman that holds his heart as an equal, but an object to be worshiped.

Characters like this need to die already.! I want to read stories about women who are college educated--yes, I'm that type of woman, and I know plenty of others who are too.  want to read about men who are real--men who have flaws and dreams and those who don't need to be in the spotlight
. haracters like that aren't perfect, but they are real... and they can still have love in their lives.

In my opinion, there is nothing worse than reading about a cliché character. Too many times have I read a book that seems like the author just read one too many romance novels and decided to copy character profiles. 

he woman in these stories can only wear heels, she is always ready for her hair to be blown around at the slightest sign of wind ,abeautiful as a goddess, naïve nd
 a virgin. As she has been waiting for love, she also knows that gold diggers and poseurs don't deserve her undying love. 


he man in these stories is a boss, a millionaire, a hero, he must travel the world and have women fawning over
 him.  Her long awaited Prince Charming cannot be less than movie-star handsome, he must play ball with orphans, and he has to read books too. He will never think of the woman that holds his heart as an equal, but an object to be worshiped.

Characters like this need to die already.! I want to read stories about women who are college educated--yes, I'm that type of woman, and I know plenty of others who are too.  want to read about men who are real--men who have flaws and dreams and those who don't need to be in the spotlight
. haracters like that aren't perfect, but they are real... and they can still have love in their lives.

In my opinion, there is nothing worse than reading about a cliché character. Too many times have I read a book that seems like the author just read one too many romance novels and decided to copy character profiles. 

he woman in these stories can only wear heels, she is always ready for her hair to be blown around at the slightest sign of wind ,abeautiful as a goddess, naïve nd
 a virgin. As she has been waiting for love, she also knows that gold diggers and poseurs don't deserve her undying love. 


he man in these stories is a boss, a millionaire, a hero, he must travel the world and have women fawning over
 him.  Her long awaited Prince Charming cannot be less than movie-star handsome, he must play ball with orphans, and he has to read books too. He will never think of the woman that holds his heart as an equal, but an object to be worshiped.

Characters like this need to die already.! I want to read stories about women who are college educated--yes, I'm that type of woman, and I know plenty of others who are too.  want to read about men who are real--men who have flaws and dreams and those who don't need to be in the spotlight
. haracters like that aren't perfect, but they are real... and they can still have love in their lives.

I won't read books or watch television with such lazy writing. It isn't healthy, and I'm tired of it. I don't want my daughters to grow up with such unrealistic perceptions of love and dating.

 a virgin. As she has been waiting for love, she also knows that gold diggers and poseurs don't deserve her undying love. 


he man in these stories is a boss, a millionaire, a hero, he must travel the world and have women fawning over
 him.  Her long awaited Prince Charming cannot be less than movie-star handsome, he must play ball with orphans, and he has to read books too. He will never think of the woman that holds his heart as an equal, but an object to be worshiped.
