Free individuals with rights and independence have implied responsibilities. We all have a responsibility to be informed citizens. We have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world around us. We have a responsibility to be aware of what is happening in our community, state, and country.  Only by knowing what is happening around us can we make an informed decision on issues that impact our families, our futures, and our world. 

If we wish to enjoy our freedom, we must stay current on which leaders and policies grant us these rights. We must stay informed on the issues that are being debated in our government. Ignorance is one step from servitude.  If we don't pay attention to important events, we allow those who are informed, with ill purpose, to control us, the world, and our children's futures. 

I wouldn't say that those who aren't informed are bad, but that they do hurt the wellbeing of others.

Free individuals with rights and independence have implied responsibilities. We all have a responsibility to be informed citizens. We have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world around us. We have a responsibility to be aware of what is happening in our community, state, and country.  Only by knowing what is happening around us can we make an informed decision on issues that impact our families, our futures, and our world. 

If we wish to enjoy our freedom, we must stay current on which leaders and policies grant us these rights. We must stay informed on the issues that are being debated in our government. Ignorance is one step from servitude.  If we don't pay attention to important events, we allow those who are informed, with ill purpose, to control us, the world, and our children's futures. 

I wouldn't say that those who aren't informed are bad, but that they do hurt the wellbeing of others. I believe that we are all responsible for our own actions. But 

There will always be wicked and corrupt people who take advantage of the apathy of people.  It is up to us to stay informed, stay alert, and preserve our natural resources for our children.

We have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world around us. We have a responsibility to be aware of what is happening in our community, state, and country.  Only by knowing what is happening around us can we make an informed decision on issues that impact our families, our futures, and our world. 

If we wish to enjoy our freedom, we must stay current on which leaders and policies grant us these rights. We must stay informed on the issues that are being debated in our government. Ignorance is one step from servitude.  If we don't pay attention to important events, we allow those who are informed, with ill purpose, to control us, the world, and our children's futures. 

I wouldn't say that those who aren't informed are bad, but that they do hurt the wellbeing of others. I believe that we are all responsible for our own actions. I also believe we are a community made up of individuals whose every decision impacts everyone else.  In this age of the internet, it's cheap and incredibly easy to stay informed on current event

There will always be wicked and corrupt people who take advantage of the apathy of people.  It is up to us to stay informed, stay alert, and preserve our natural resources for our children.

We have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world around us. We have a responsibility to be aware of what is happening in our community, state, and country.

If we wish to enjoy our freedom, we must stay current on which leaders and policies grant us these rights. We must stay informed on the issues that are being debated in our government. Ignorance is one step from servitude.  If we don't pay attention to important events, we allow those who are informed, with ill purpose, to control us, the world, and our children's futures.

Free individuals with rights and independence have implied responsibilities. We all have a responsibility to be informed citizens. We have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world around us. We have a responsibility to be aware of what is happening in our community, state, and country.

Free individuals with rights and independence have implied responsibilities. We all have a responsibility to be informed citizens. We have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world around us. We have a responsibility to be aware of what is happening in our community, state, and country.

Ignorance is one step from servitude.  If we don't pay attention to important events, we allow those who are informed, with ill purpose, to control us, the world, and our children's futures.

Free individuals with rights and independence have implied responsibilities. We all have a responsibility to be informed citizens. We have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world around us. We have a responsibility to be aware of what is happening in our community, state, and country.  Only by knowing what is happening around us can we make an informed decision on issues that impact our families, our futures, and our world. 

If we wish to enjoy our freedom, we must stay current on which leaders and policies grant us these rights. We must stay informed on the issues that are being debated in our government. Ignorance is one step from servitude.  If we don't pay attention to important events, we allow those who are informed, with ill purpose, to control us, the world, and our children's futures. 

I wouldn't say that those who aren't informed are bad, but that they do hurt the wellbeing of others. I believe that we are all responsible for our own actions. I also believe we are a community made up of individuals whose every decision impacts everyone else.  In this age of the internet, it's cheap and incredibly easy to stay informed on current events. If you don't stay informed out of an altruistic sense of community, you can also stay informed from self-preservation or self-interest.

Free individuals with rights and independence have implied responsibilities. We all have a responsibility to be informed citizens. We have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world around us. We have a responsibility to be aware of what is happening in our community, state, and country.  Only by knowing what is happening around us can we make an informed decision on issues that impact our families, our futures, and our world. 

If we wish to enjoy our freedom, we must stay current on which leaders and policies grant us these rights. We must stay informed on the issues that are being debated in our government. Ignorance is one step from servitude.  If we don't pay attention to important events, we allow those who are informed, with ill purpose, to control us, the world, and our children's futures. 

I wouldn't say that those who aren't informed are bad, but that they do hurt the wellbeing of others. I believe that we are all responsible for our own actions. I also believe we are a community made up of individuals whose every decision impacts everyone else.  In this age of the internet, it's cheap and incredibly easy to stay informed on current events. If you don't stay informed out of an altruistic sense of community, you can also stay informed from self-preservation or self-interest. 

There will always be wicked and corrupt people who take advantage of the apathy of people.  It is up to us to stay informed, stay alert, and preserve our resources  for ourselves, our children.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

Free individuals with rights and independence have implied responsibilities. We all have a responsibility to be informed citizens. We have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world around us. We have a responsibility to be aware of what is happening in our community, state, and country.  Only by knowing what is happening around us can we make an informed decision on issues that impact our families, our futures, and our world. 

If we wish to enjoy our freedom, we must stay current on which leaders and policies grant us these rights. We must stay informed on the issues that are being debated in our government. Ignorance is one step from servitude.  If we don't pay attention to important events, we allow those who are informed, with ill purpose, to control us, the world, and our children's futures. 

I wouldn't say that those who aren't informed are bad, but that they do hurt the wellbeing of others. I believe that we are all responsible for our own actions. I also believe we are a community made up of individuals whose every decision impacts everyone else.  In this age of the internet, it's cheap and incredibly easy to stay informed on current events. If you don't stay informed out of an altruistic sense of community, you can also stay informed from self-preservation or self-interest. 

There will always be wicked and corrupt people who take advantage of the apathy of people.  It is up to us to stay informed, stay alert, and preserve our resources  for ourselves, our children o the Earth.
