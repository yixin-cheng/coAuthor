Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I really don't buy it. I don't buy the idea that people would care about an animal over caring about a tourist being beaten with any kind of weapon. I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal. If you saw a dog and a person both drowning at the same time, and could only save the life of one, I doubt that most people would save the dog. You see this, unfortunately, all the time with police officers and firefighters. They will run into a burning building and look for people first, then any pets or animals.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I really don't buy it. I don't buy the idea that people would care about an animal over caring about a tourist being beaten with any kind of weapon. I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I really don't buy it. I don't buy the idea that people would care about an animal over caring about a tourist being beaten with any kind of weapon. I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal. If you saw a dog and a person both drowning at the same time, and could only save the life of one, I doubt that most people would save the dog. You see this, unfortunately, all the time with police officers and firefighters. They will run into a burning building and look for people first, then any pets or animals.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I really don't buy it. I don't buy the idea that people would care about an animal over caring about a tourist being beaten with any kind of weapon. I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal. If you saw a dog and a person both drowning at the same time, and could only save the life of one, I doubt that most people would save the dog. You see this, unfortunately, all the time with police officers and firefighters. They will run into a burning building and look for people first, then any pets or animals.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I really don't buy it. I don't buy the idea that people would care about an animal over caring about a tourist being beaten with any kind of weapon. I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal. If you saw a dog and a person both drowning at the same time, and could only save the life of one, I doubt that most people would save the dog. You see this, unfortunately, all the time with police officers and firefighters. They will run into a burning building and look for people first, then any pets or animals.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I really don't buy it. I don't buy the idea that people would care about an animal over caring about a tourist being beaten with any kind of weapon. I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal. If you saw a dog and a person both drowning at the same time, and could only save the life of one, I doubt that most people would save the dog. You see this, unfortunately, all the time with police officers and firefighters. They will run into a burning building and look for people first, then any pets or animals. In the same way, if a couple is driving down the road and their car breaks down, there would be a people that would stop to offer their help. To suggested otherwise is basically like saying all human beings are mostly monsters who do not care about other people.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I really don't buy it. I don't buy the idea that people would care about an animal over caring about a tourist being beaten with any kind of weapon. I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal. If you saw a dog and a person both drowning at the same time, and could only save the life of one, I doubt that most people would save the dog. You see this, unfortunately, all the time with police officers and firefighters. They will run into a burning building and look for people first, then any pets or animals.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I really don't buy it. I don't buy the idea that people would care about an animal over caring about a tourist being beaten with any kind of weapon. I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal. If you saw a dog and a person both drowning at the same time, and could only save the life of one, I doubt that most people would save the dog. You see this, unfortunately, all the time with police officers and firefighters. They will run into a burning building and look for people first, then any pets or animals.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I really don't buy it. I don't buy the idea that people would care about an animal over caring about a tourist being beaten with any kind of weapon. I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal. If you saw a dog and a person both drowning at the same time, and could only save the life of one, I doubt that most people would save the dog. You see this, unfortunately, all the time with police officers and firefighters. They will run into a burning building and look for people first, then any pets or animals. In the same way, if a couple is driving down the road and their car breaks down, there would be a people that would stop to offer their help.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I really don't buy it. I don't buy the idea that people would care about an animal over caring about a tourist being beaten with any kind of weapon. I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I really don't buy it. I don't buy the idea that people would care about an animal over caring about a tourist being beaten with any kind of weapon. I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal. If you saw a dog and a person both drowning at the same time, and could only save the life of one, I doubt that most people would save the dog. You see this, unfortunately, all the time with police officers and firefighters. They will run into a burning building and look for people first, then any pets or animals. In the same way, if a couple is driving down the road and their car breaks down, there would be a people that would stop to offer their help. To suggested otherwise is basically like saying all human beings are mostly monsters who do not care about other people. I find that false, because I have also experienced almost being robbed in a foreign country in south east asia. There were two guys who chased of the mugger, and made sure I was ok before sending me on my way and telling me to try to be careful. They did that because   they cared about me, they didn't even know me or my situation, but they cared for my well-being.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, I really don't buy it. I don't buy the idea that people would care about an animal over caring about a tourist being beaten with any kind of weapon. I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal. If you saw a dog and a person both drowning at the same time, and could only save the life of one, I doubt that most people would save the dog. You see this, unfortunately, all the time with police officers and firefighters. They will run into a burning building and look for people first, then any pets or animals. In the same way, if a couple is driving down the road and their car breaks down, there would be a people that would stop to offer their help. To suggested otherwise is basically like saying all human beings are mostly monsters who do not care about other people. I find that false, because I have also experienced almost being robbed in a foreign country in south east asia.

In my opinion, I really don't buy it. I don't buy the idea that people would care about an animal over caring about a tourist being beaten with any kind of weapon. I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal. If you saw a dog and a person both drowning at the same time, and could only save the life of one, I doubt that most people would save the dog. You see this, unfortunately, all the time with police officers and firefighters. They will run into a burning building and look for people first, then any pets or animals. In the same way, if a couple is driving down the road and their car breaks down, there would be a people that would stop to offer their help. To suggested otherwise is basically like saying all human beings are mostly monsters who do not care about other people.

In my opinion, I really don't buy it. I don't buy the idea that people would care about an animal over caring about a tourist being beaten with any kind of weapon. I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal. If you saw a dog and a person both drowning at the same time, and could only save the life of one, I doubt that most people would save the dog. You see this, unfortunately, all the time with police officers and firefighters. They will run into a burning building and look for people first, then any pets or animals. In the same way, if a couple is driving down the road and their car breaks down, there would be a people that would stop to offer their help. To suggested otherwise is basically like saying all human beings are mostly monsters who do not care about other people. I find that false, because I have also experienced almost being robbed in a foreign country in south east asia. There were two guys who chased of the mugger, and made sure I was ok before sending me on my way and telling me to try to be careful. They did that because   they cared about me, they didn't even know me or my situation, but they cared for my well-being.

I just think the media tries to convince us by using sensationalism and shock value of animal abuse. I understand there are some horrible people out there, but I don't think it's fair to try to paint all humans with that same brush, because most people are not even like that.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal. If you saw a dog and a person both drowning at the same time, and could only save the life of one, I doubt that most people would save the dog. You see this, unfortunately, all the time with police officers and firefighters. They will run into a burning building and look for people first, then any pets or animals. In the same way, if a couple is driving down the road and their car breaks down, there would be a people that would stop to offer their help. To suggested otherwise is basically like saying all human beings are mostly monsters who do not care about other people. I find that false, because I have also experienced almost being robbed in a foreign country in south east asia. There were two guys who chased of the mugger, and made sure I was ok before sending me on my way and telling me to try to be careful. They did that because   they cared about me, they didn't even know me or my situation, but they cared for my well-being.

I just think the media tries to convince us by using sensationalism and shock value of animal abuse. I understand there are some horrible people out there, but I don't think it's fair to try to paint all humans with that same brush, because most people are not even like that. 

On the other hand, we see videos of people sticking puppies and kittens in the dryer and I am deeply offended by this, but I think people would have a far worse reaction ",2230,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1185

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I really don't buy it. I don't buy the idea that people would care about an animal over caring about a tourist being beaten with any kind of weapon. I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal. If you saw a dog and a person both drowning at the same time, and could only save the life of one, I doubt that most people would save the dog. You see this, unfortunately, all the time with police officers and firefighters. They will run into a burning building and look for people first, then any pets or animals. In the same way, if a couple is driving down the road and their car breaks down, there would be a people that would stop to offer their help. To suggested otherwise is basically like saying all human beings are mostly monsters who do not care about other people. I find that false, because I have also experienced almost being robbed in a foreign country in south east asia. There were two guys who chased of the mugger, and made sure I was ok before sending me on my way and telling me to try to be careful. They did that because   they cared about me, they didn't even know me or my situation, but they cared for my well-being.

I just think the media tries to convince us by using sensationalism and shock value of animal abuse. I understand there are some horrible people out there, but I don't think it's fair to try to paint all humans with that same brush, because most people are not even like that. 

On the other hand, we see videos of people sticking puppies and kittens in the dryer and I am deeply offended by this, but I think people would have a far worse reaction if they saw it",2244,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1199

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

They did that because   they cared about me, they didn't even know me or my situation, but they cared for my well-being.

I just think the media tries to convince us by using sensationalism and shock value of animal abuse. I understand there are some horrible people out there, but I don't think it's fair to try to paint all humans with that same brush, because most people are not even like that.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, I really don't buy it. I don't buy the idea that people would care about an animal over caring about a tourist being beaten with any kind of weapon. I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal. If you saw a dog and a person both drowning at the same time, and could only save the life of one, I doubt that most people would save the dog. You see this, unfortunately, all the time with police officers and firefighters. They will run into a burning building and look for people first, then any pets or animals. In the same way, if a couple is driving down the road and their car breaks down, there would be a people that would stop to offer their help. To suggested otherwise is basically like saying all human beings are mostly monsters who do not care about other people. I find that false, because I have also experienced almost being robbed in a foreign country in south east asia. There were two guys who chased of the mugger, and made sure I was ok before sending me on my way and telling me to try to be careful. They did that because   they cared about me, they didn't even know me or my situation, but they cared for my well-being.

In my opinion, I really don't buy it. I don't buy the idea that people would care about an animal over caring about a tourist being beaten with any kind of weapon. I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal. If you saw a dog and a person both drowning at the same time, and could only save the life of one, I doubt that most people would save the dog. You see this, unfortunately, all the time with police officers and firefighters. They will run into a burning building and look for people first, then any pets or animals. In the same way, if a couple is driving down the road and their car breaks down, there would be a people that would stop to offer their help. To suggested otherwise is basically like saying all human beings are mostly monsters who do not care about other people. I find that false, because I have also experienced almost being robbed in a foreign country in south east asia. There were two guys who chased of the mugger, and made sure I was ok before sending me on my way and telling me to try to be careful. They did that because   they cared about me, they didn't even know me or my situation, but they cared for my well-being.

I just think the media tries to convince us by using sensationalism and shock value of animal abuse. I understand there are some horrible people out there, but I don't think it's fair to try to paint all humans with that same brush, because most people are not even like that. 

On the other hand, we see videos of people sticking puppies and kittens in the dryer and I am deeply offended by this, but I think people would have a far worse reaction if they saw it happen to a human baby. Not to mention, if a person a",2298,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1253

I just think the media tries to convince us by using sensationalism and shock value of animal abuse. I understand there are some horrible people out there, but I don't think it's fair to try to paint all humans with that same brush, because most people are not even like that.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, I really don't buy it. I don't buy the idea that people would care about an animal over caring about a tourist being beaten with any kind of weapon. I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal. If you saw a dog and a person both drowning at the same time, and could only save the life of one, I doubt that most people would save the dog. You see this, unfortunately, all the time with police officers and firefighters. They will run into a burning building and look for people first, then any pets or animals. In the same way, if a couple is driving down the road and their car breaks down, there would be a people that would stop to offer their help.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I really don't buy it. I don't buy the idea that people would care about an animal over caring about a tourist being beaten with any kind of weapon. I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal. If you saw a dog and a person both drowning at the same time, and could only save the life of one, I doubt that most people would save the dog. You see this, unfortunately, all the time with police officers and firefighters. They will run into a burning building and look for people first, then any pets or animals. In the same way, if a couple is driving down the road and their car breaks down, there would be a people that would stop to offer their help. To suggested otherwise is basically like saying all human beings are mostly monsters who do not care about other people. I find that false, because I have also experienced almost being robbed in a foreign country in south east asia. There were two guys who chased of the mugger, and made sure I was ok before sending me on my way and telling me to try to be careful. They did that because   they cared about me, they didn't even know me or my situation, but they cared for my well-being.

I just think the media tries to convince us by using sensationalism and shock value of animal abuse. I understand there are some horrible people out there, but I don't think it's fair to try to paint all humans with that same brush, because most people are not even like that.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I really don't buy it. I don't buy the idea that people would care about an animal over caring about a tourist being beaten with any kind of weapon. I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal. If you saw a dog and a person both drowning at the same time, and could only save the life of one, I doubt that most people would save the dog. You see this, unfortunately, all the time with police officers and firefighters. They will run into a burning building and look for people first, then any pets or animals. In the same way, if a couple is driving down the road and their car breaks down, there would be a people that would stop to offer their help. To suggested otherwise is basically like saying all human beings are mostly monsters who do not care about other people. I find that false, because I have also experienced almost being robbed in a foreign country in south east asia. There were two guys who chased of the mugger, and made sure I was ok before sending me on my way and telling me to try to be careful. They did that because   they cared about me, they didn't even know me or my situation, but they cared for my well-being.

I just think the media tries to convince us by using sensationalism and shock value of animal abuse. I understand there are some horrible people out there, but I don't think it's fair to try to paint all humans with that same brush, because most people are not even like that. 

On the other hand, we see videos of people sticking puppies and kittens in the dryer and I am deeply offended by this, but I think people would have a far worse reaction if they saw it happen to a human baby.

In my opinion, I really don't buy it. I don't buy the idea that people would care about an animal over caring about a tourist being beaten with any kind of weapon. I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal. If you saw a dog and a person both drowning at the same time, and could only save the life of one, I doubt that most people would save the dog. You see this, unfortunately, all the time with police officers and firefighters. They will run into a burning building and look for people first, then any pets or animals. In the same way, if a couple is driving down the road and their car breaks down, there would be a people that would stop to offer their help. To suggested otherwise is basically like saying all human beings are mostly monsters who do not care about other people. I find that false, because I have also experienced almost being robbed in a foreign country in south east asia. There were two guys who chased of the mugger, and made sure I was ok before sending me on my way and telling me to try to be careful. They did that because   they cared about me, they didn't even know me or my situation, but they cared for my well-being.

I just think the media tries to convince us by using sensationalism and shock value of animal abuse. I understand there are some horrible people out there, but I don't think it's fair to try to paint all humans with that same brush, because most people are not even like that. 

On the other hand, we see videos of people sticking puppies and kittens in the dryer and I am deeply offended by this, but I think people would have a far worse reaction if they saw it happen to a human baby.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

I just think the media tries to convince us by using sensationalism and shock value of animal abuse. I understand there are some horrible people out there, but I don't think it's fair to try to paint all humans with that same brush, because most people are not even like that. 

On the other hand, we see videos of people sticking puppies and kittens in the dryer and I am deeply offended by this, but I think people would have a far worse reaction if they saw it happen to a human baby.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I really don't buy it. I don't buy the idea that people would care about an animal over caring about a tourist being beaten with any kind of weapon. I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal. If you saw a dog and a person both drowning at the same time, and could only save the life of one, I doubt that most people would save the dog.
