In my opinion, schools are ideally responsible for the safety, health, welfare and formal education of young people. Unfortunately, many school districts barely have funding to provide education, leaving absolutely nothing for considerations of health and welfare of the children. And that doesn't even factor in the other things that schools are responsible for (building maintenance, transportation of students and special needs children, etc.

The short answer is yes, schools should be providing everything that any and all students may need, throughout the school day. Unfortunately, the text above isn't an opinion piece, and so the short answer, though likely correct, is rather unsatisfying. It is disingenuous to suggest that schools should provide more material resources than they are afforded by their communities. The slightly longer and much sadder answer is, yes they should provide such resources to students, if they can afford to do that.

In my opinion, schools are ideally responsible for the safety, health, welfare and formal education of young people. Unfortunately, many school districts barely have funding to provide education, leaving absolutely nothing for considerations of health and welfare of the children. And that doesn't even factor in the other things that schools are responsible for (building maintenance, transportation of students and special needs children, etc.

The short answer is yes, schools should be providing everything that any and all students may need, throughout the school day. Unfortunately, the text above isn't an opinion piece, and so the short answer, though likely correct, is rather unsatisfying. It is disingenuous to suggest that schools should provide more material resources than they are afforded by their communities. The slightly longer and much sadder answer is, yes they should provide such resources to students, if they can afford to do that. That is not ideal, but it is the reality faced by school administrators.

The problem of sanitary napkins in schools cannot be addressed without first addressing the broader social issue of community expenditures. Communities decide how to allocate funds, and until they allocate a sufficient amount to the school systems that serve their children, the schools are not, ultimately, to blame for a lack of resources.

In my opinion, schools are ideally responsible for the safety, health, welfare and formal education of young people.

The short answer is yes, schools should be providing everything that any and all students may need, throughout the school day. Unfortunately, the text above isn't an opinion piece, and so the short answer, though likely correct, is rather unsatisfying. It is disingenuous to suggest that schools should provide more material resources than they are afforded by their communities.

In my opinion, schools are ideally responsible for the safety, health, welfare and formal education of young people. Unfortunately, many school districts barely have funding to provide education, leaving absolutely nothing for considerations of health and welfare of the children.

The short answer is yes, schools should be providing everything that any and all students may need, throughout the school day. Unfortunately, the text above isn't an opinion piece, and so the short answer, though likely correct, is rather unsatisfying. It is disingenuous to suggest that schools should provide more material resources than they are afforded by their communities. The slightly longer and much sadder answer is, yes they should provide such resources to students, if they can afford to do that. That is not ideal, but it is the reality faced by school administrators.

The problem of sanitary napkins in schools cannot be addressed without first addressing the broader social issue of community expenditures.

In my opinion, schools are ideally responsible for the safety, health, welfare and formal education of young people. Unfortunately, many school districts barely have funding to provide education, leaving absolutely nothing for considerations of health and welfare of the children. And that doesn't even factor in the other things that schools are responsible for (building maintenance, transportation of students and special needs children, etc.

The short answer is yes, schools should be providing everything that any and all students may need, throughout the school day. Unfortunately, the text above isn't an opinion piece, and so the short answer, though likely correct, is rather unsatisfying. It is disingenuous to suggest that schools should provide more material resources than they are afforded by their communities. The slightly longer and much sadder answer is, yes they should provide such resources to students, if they can afford to do that. That is not ideal, but it is the reality faced by school administrators.

The problem of sanitary napkins in schools cannot be addressed without first addressing the broader social issue of community expenditures.

Unfortunately, many school districts barely have funding to provide education, leaving absolutely nothing for considerations of health and welfare of the children. And that doesn't even factor in the other things that schools are responsible for (building maintenance, transportation of students and special needs children, etc.

The slightly longer and much sadder answer is, yes they should provide such resources to students, if they can afford to do that.

In my opinion, schools are ideally responsible for the safety, health, welfare and formal education of young people. Unfortunately, many school districts barely have funding to provide education, leaving absolutely nothing for considerations of health and welfare of the children. And that doesn't even factor in the other things that schools are responsible for (building maintenance, transportation of students and special needs children, etc.

The short answer is yes, schools should be providing everything that any and all students may need, throughout the school day. Unfortunately, the text above isn't an opinion piece, and so the short answer, though likely correct, is rather unsatisfying. It is disingenuous to suggest that schools should provide more material resources than they are afforded by their communities. The slightly longer and much sadder answer is, yes they should provide such resources to students, if they can afford to do that. That is not ideal, but it is the reality faced by school administrators.

The problem of sanitary napkins in schools cannot be addressed without first addressing the broader social issue of community expenditures.

In my opinion, schools are ideally responsible for the safety, health, welfare and formal education of young people. Unfortunately, many school districts barely have funding to provide education, leaving absolutely nothing for considerations of health and welfare of the children. And that doesn't even factor in the other things that schools are responsible for (building maintenance, transportation of students and special needs children, etc.

The short answer is yes, schools should be providing everything that any and all students may need, throughout the school day. Unfortunately, the text above isn't an opinion piece, and so the short answer, though likely correct, is rather unsatisfying. It is disingenuous to suggest that schools should provide more material resources than they are afforded by their communities. The slightly longer and much sadder answer is, yes they should provide such resources to students, if they can afford to do that. That is not ideal, but it is the reality faced by school administrators.

The problem of sanitary napkins in schools cannot be addressed without first addressing the broader social issue of community expenditures.

In my opinion, schools are ideally responsible for the safety, health, welfare and formal education of young people. Unfortunately, many school districts barely have funding to provide education, leaving absolutely nothing for considerations of health and welfare of the children. And that doesn't even factor in the other things that schools are responsible for (building maintenance, transportation of students and special needs children, etc.

The short answer is yes, schools should be providing everything that any and all students may need, throughout the school day. Unfortunately, the text above isn't an opinion piece, and so the short answer, though likely correct, is rather unsatisfying. It is disingenuous to suggest that schools should provide more material resources than they are afforded by their communities. The slightly longer and much sadder answer is, yes they should provide such resources to students, if they can afford to do that. That is not ideal, but it is the reality faced by school administrators.

The problem of sanitary napkins in schools cannot be addressed without first addressing the broader social issue of community expenditures. Communities decide how to allocate funds, and until they allocate a sufficient amount to the school systems that serve their children, the schools are not, ultimately, to blame for a lack of resources. That said, it is the school administrators’ responsibility to find creative ways to be responsive to vulnerable populations within their districts. There needs to be a renewed interest in renaissance values to get the necessary funding and there needs to be accountability, from an administrative point of view, for how the funds are used.

Unfortunately, many school districts barely have funding to provide education, leaving absolutely nothing for considerations of health and welfare of the children. And that doesn't even factor in the other things that schools are responsible for (building maintenance, transportation of students and special needs children, etc.

The short answer is yes, schools should be providing everything that any and all students may need, throughout the school day. Unfortunately, the text above isn't an opinion piece, and so the short answer, though likely correct, is rather unsatisfying. It is disingenuous to suggest that schools should provide more material resources than they are afforded by their communities. The slightly longer and much sadder answer is, yes they should provide such resources to students, if they can afford to do that. That is not ideal, but it is the reality faced by school administrators.

The problem of sanitary napkins in schools cannot be addressed without first addressing the broader social issue of community expenditures. Communities decide how to allocate funds, and until they allocate a sufficient amount to the school systems that serve their children, the schools are not, ultimately, to blame for a lack of resources. That said, it is the school administrators’ responsibility to find creative ways to be responsive to vulnerable populations within their districts.

In my opinion, schools are ideally responsible for the safety, health, welfare and formal education of young people. Unfortunately, many school districts barely have funding to provide education, leaving absolutely nothing for considerations of health and welfare of the children. And that doesn't even factor in the other things that schools are responsible for (building maintenance, transportation of students and special needs children, etc.

The short answer is yes, schools should be providing everything that any and all students may need, throughout the school day. Unfortunately, the text above isn't an opinion piece, and so the short answer, though likely correct, is rather unsatisfying. It is disingenuous to suggest that schools should provide more material resources than they are afforded by their communities. The slightly longer and much sadder answer is, yes they should provide such resources to students, if they can afford to do that. That is not ideal, but it is the reality faced by school administrators.

The problem of sanitary napkins in schools cannot be addressed without first addressing the broader social issue of community expenditures. Communities decide how to allocate funds, and until they allocate a sufficient amount to the school systems that serve their children, the schools are not, ultimately, to blame for a lack of resources. That said, it is the school administrators’ responsibility to find creative ways to be responsive to vulnerable populations within their districts.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools are ideally responsible for the safety, health, welfare and formal education of young people. Unfortunately, many school districts barely have funding to provide education, leaving absolutely nothing for considerations of health and welfare of the children. And that doesn't even factor in the other things that schools are responsible for (building maintenance, transportation of students and special needs children, etc.

The short answer is yes, schools should be providing everything that any and all students may need, throughout the school day. Unfortunately, the text above isn't an opinion piece, and so the short answer, though likely correct, is rather unsatisfying. It is disingenuous to suggest that schools should provide more material resources than they are afforded by their communities. The slightly longer and much sadder answer is, yes they should provide such resources to students, if they can afford to do that. That is not ideal, but it is the reality faced by school administrators.

The problem of sanitary napkins in schools cannot be addressed without first addressing the broader social issue of community expenditures. Communities decide how to allocate funds, and until they allocate a sufficient amount to the school systems that serve their children, the schools are not, ultimately, to blame for a lack of resources. That said, it is the school administrators’ responsibility to find creative ways to be responsive to vulnerable populations within their districts. There needs to be a renewed interest in renaissance values to get the necessary funding and there needs to be accountability, from an administrative point of view, for how the funds are used.

In my opinion, schools are ideally responsible for the safety, health, welfare and formal education of young people. Unfortunately, many school districts barely have funding to provide education, leaving absolutely nothing for considerations of health and welfare of the children. And that doesn't even factor in the other things that schools are responsible for (building maintenance, transportation of students and special needs children, etc.

The short answer is yes, schools should be providing everything that any and all students may need, throughout the school day. Unfortunately, the text above isn't an opinion piece, and so the short answer, though likely correct, is rather unsatisfying. It is disingenuous to suggest that schools should provide more material resources than they are afforded by their communities. The slightly longer and much sadder answer is, yes they should provide such resources to students, if they can afford to do that. That is not ideal, but it is the reality faced by school administrators.

The problem of sanitary napkins in schools cannot be addressed without first addressing the broader social issue of community expenditures. Communities decide how to allocate funds, and until they allocate a sufficient amount to the school systems that serve their children, the schools are not, ultimately, to blame for a lack of resources. That said, it is the school administrators’ responsibility to find creative ways to be responsive to vulnerable populations within their districts.

In my opinion, schools are ideally responsible for the safety, health, welfare and formal education of young people. Unfortunately, many school districts barely have funding to provide education, leaving absolutely nothing for considerations of health and welfare of the children. And that doesn't even factor in the other things that schools are responsible for (building maintenance, transportation of students and special needs children, etc.

The short answer is yes, schools should be providing everything that any and all students may need, throughout the school day. Unfortunately, the text above isn't an opinion piece, and so the short answer, though likely correct, is rather unsatisfying. It is disingenuous to suggest that schools should provide more material resources than they are afforded by their communities. The slightly longer and much sadder answer is, yes they should provide such resources to students, if they can afford to do that. That is not ideal, but it is the reality faced by school administrators.

The problem of sanitary napkins in schools cannot be addressed without first addressing the broader social issue of community expenditures. Communities decide how to allocate funds, and until they allocate a sufficient amount to the school systems that serve their children, the schools are not, ultimately, to blame for a lack of resources.

In my opinion, schools are ideally responsible for the safety, health, welfare and formal education of young people. Unfortunately, many school districts barely have funding to provide education, leaving absolutely nothing for considerations of health and welfare of the children. And that doesn't even factor in the other things that schools are responsible for (building maintenance, transportation of students and special needs children, etc.

The short answer is yes, schools should be providing everything that any and all students may need, throughout the school day. Unfortunately, the text above isn't an opinion piece, and so the short answer, though likely correct, is rather unsatisfying. It is disingenuous to suggest that schools should provide more material resources than they are afforded by their communities. The slightly longer and much sadder answer is, yes they should provide such resources to students, if they can afford to do that. That is not ideal, but it is the reality faced by school administrators.

The problem of sanitary napkins in schools cannot be addressed without first addressing the broader social issue of community expenditures. Communities decide how to allocate funds, and until they allocate a sufficient amount to the school systems that serve their children, the schools are not, ultimately, to blame for a lack of resources. That said, it is the school administrators’ responsibility to find creative ways to be responsive to vulnerable populations within their districts. There needs to be a renewed interest in renaissance values to get the necessary funding and there needs to be accountability, from an administrative point of view, for how the funds are used. It's a multi-faceted problem that begins with voter mindset.

The short answer is yes, schools should be providing everything that any and all students may need, throughout the school day.

Communities decide how to allocate funds, and until they allocate a sufficient amount to the school systems that serve their children, the schools are not, ultimately, to blame for a lack of resources. That said, it is the school administrators’ responsibility to find creative ways to be responsive to vulnerable populations within their districts. There needs to be a renewed interest in renaissance values to get the necessary funding and there needs to be accountability, from an administrative point of view, for how the funds are used. It's a multi-faceted problem that begins with voter mindset.

There can be no simple solution to this problem. For now, administrators will have to do the best they can with what they have",2269,[],0,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1835

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools are ideally responsible for the safety, health, welfare and formal education of young people. Unfortunately, many school districts barely have funding to provide education, leaving absolutely nothing for considerations of health and welfare of the children. And that doesn't even factor in the other things that schools are responsible for (building maintenance, transportation of students and special needs children, etc.

The short answer is yes, schools should be providing everything that any and all students may need, throughout the school day. Unfortunately, the text above isn't an opinion piece, and so the short answer, though likely correct, is rather unsatisfying. It is disingenuous to suggest that schools should provide more material resources than they are afforded by their communities. The slightly longer and much sadder answer is, yes they should provide such resources to students, if they can afford to do that. That is not ideal, but it is the reality faced by school administrators.
