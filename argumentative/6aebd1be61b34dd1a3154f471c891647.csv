I've never experienced period shaming, but have personally witnessed someone get her first period during a class, without knowing what it was, in a class of cruel children. It was an traumatic memory that will hurt and stay with her for the rest of her life. Menstruation is less controversial a topic than most Sex Ed topic, and people from all walks of life can agree that it happens to girls during puberty, and requires ways to control it. Without proper help during periods, clothes can be damaged, and there can be unsanitary conditions, not to mention potential humiliation and judgement from uncaring peers. 

Pads and tampons are similar to toilet paper, soap and Band-Aids because they all serve a common purpose: they help clean and protect, to prevent illness and infection.  The parents should provide most basic healthcare items, but they also should be available from the school.

I've never experienced period shaming, but have personally witnessed someone get her first period during a class, without knowing what it was, in a class of cruel children. It was an traumatic memory that will hurt and stay with her for the rest of her life. Menstruation is less controversial a topic than most Sex Ed topic, and people from all walks of life can agree that it happens to girls during puberty, and requires ways to control it. Without proper help during periods, clothes can be damaged, and there can be unsanitary conditions, not to mention potential humiliation and judgement from uncaring peers. 

Pads and tampons are similar to toilet paper, soap and Band-Aids because they all serve a common purpose: they help clean and protect, to prevent illness and infection.  The parents should provide most basic healthcare items, but they also should be available from the school. 
No girl should ever need to have embarrassing stains or be afraid of her own body. It is the least we can do to provide cheap and readily available tampons and pads in our schools.

I've never experienced period shaming, but have personally witnessed someone get her first period during a class, without knowing what it was, in a class of cruel children. It was an traumatic memory that will hurt and stay with her for the rest of her life. 

Menstruation is less controversial a topic than most Sex Ed topic, and people from all walks of life can agree that it happens to girls during puberty, and requires ways to control it. Without proper help during periods, clothes can be damaged, and there can be unsanitary conditions, not to mention potential humiliation and judgement from uncaring peers. 

Pads and tampons are similar to toilet paper, soap and Band-Aids because they all serve a common purpose: they help clean and protect, to prevent illness and infection.  The parents should provide most basic healthcare items, but they also should be available from the school. 
No girl should ever need to have embarrassing stains or be afraid of her own body. It is the least we can do to provide cheap and readily available tampons and pads in our schools. 


Our children are the future-they deserve to have the basic items they need to stay healthy, mentally and physically.
