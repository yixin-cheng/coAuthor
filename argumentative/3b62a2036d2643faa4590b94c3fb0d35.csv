In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school is to learn about the American democratic system and how it works. I think this is the most important thing because the system affects all of our lives in a direct way, and we should know who does what and why. We have seen the result of ignorance about this system in many peoples' belief that Trump won the election and will be reinstated as President.

First, the belief that Trump won. Regardless of how much direct knowledge of the voting process one has, it is beyond doubt that the courts have reviewed over 60 lawsuits alleging fraud and have dismissed or ruled against every single one. The Supreme Court did not choose to reverse any of those rulings. In our system of government, the matter ends there. Only persons ignorant of the constitution could think that there is still a way to reverse the election results.

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school is to learn about the American democratic system and how it works. I think this is the most important thing because the system affects all of our lives in a direct way, and we should know who does what and why. We have seen the result of ignorance about this system in many peoples' belief that Trump won the election and will be reinstated as President.

First, the belief that Trump won. Regardless of how much direct knowledge of the voting process one has, it is beyond doubt that the courts have reviewed over 60 lawsuits alleging fraud and have dismissed or ruled against every single one. The Supreme Court did not choose to reverse any of those rulings. In our system of government, the matter ends there. Only persons ignorant of the constitution could think that there is still a way to reverse the election results.

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school is to learn about the American democratic system and how it works. I think this is the most important thing because the system affects all of our lives in a direct way, and we should know who does what and why. We have seen the result of ignorance about this system in many peoples' belief that Trump won the election and will be reinstated as President.

First, the belief that Trump won. Regardless of how much direct knowledge of the voting process one has, it is beyond doubt that the courts have reviewed over 60 lawsuits alleging fraud and have dismissed or ruled against every single one. The Supreme Court did not choose to reverse any of those rulings. In our system of government, the matter ends there. Only persons ignorant of the constitution could think that there is still a way to reverse the election results.

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school is to learn about the American democratic system and how it works. I think this is the most important thing because the system affects all of our lives in a direct way, and we should know who does what and why. We have seen the result of ignorance about this system in many peoples' belief that Trump won the election and will be reinstated as President.

First, the belief that Trump won. Regardless of how much direct knowledge of the voting process one has, it is beyond doubt that the courts have reviewed over 60 lawsuits alleging fraud and have dismissed or ruled against every single one. The Supreme Court did not choose to reverse any of those rulings. In our system of government, the matter ends there. Only persons ignorant of the constitution could think that there is still a way to reverse the election results.

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school is to learn about the American democratic system and how it works. I think this is the most important thing because the system affects all of our lives in a direct way, and we should know who does what and why. We have seen the result of ignorance about this system in many peoples' belief that Trump won the election and will be reinstated as President.

First, the belief that Trump won. Regardless of how much direct knowledge of the voting process one has, it is beyond doubt that the courts have reviewed over 60 lawsuits alleging fraud and have dismissed or ruled against every single one. The Supreme Court did not choose to reverse any of those rulings. In our system of government, the matter ends there. Only persons ignorant of the constitution could think that there is still a way to reverse the election results.

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school is to learn about the American democratic system and how it works. I think this is the most important thing because the system affects all of our lives in a direct way, and we should know who does what and why. We have seen the result of ignorance about this system in many peoples' belief that Trump won the election and will be reinstated as President.

First, the belief that Trump won. Regardless of how much direct knowledge of the voting process one has, it is beyond doubt that the courts have reviewed over 60 lawsuits alleging fraud and have dismissed or ruled against every single one. The Supreme Court did not choose to reverse any of those rulings. In our system of government, the matter ends there. Only persons ignorant of the constitution could think that there is still a way to reverse the election results.

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school is to learn about the American democratic system and how it works. I think this is the most important thing because the system affects all of our lives in a direct way, and we should know who does what and why. We have seen the result of ignorance about this system in many peoples' belief that Trump won the election and will be reinstated as President.

First, the belief that Trump won. Regardless of how much direct knowledge of the voting process one has, it is beyond doubt that the courts have reviewed over 60 lawsuits alleging fraud and have dismissed or ruled against every single one. The Supreme Court did not choose to reverse any of those rulings. In our system of government, the matter ends there. Only persons ignorant of the constitution could think that there is still a way to reverse the election results.
Secondly, the belief that Trump will be reinstated as President is based in ignorance of the United States Constitution.
 There is no ""reinstatement clause,"" and anyone who thinks there is, again, is ignorant of the Constitution upon which the US government is based. Although there is an impeachment process (with which Trump suppoeters shoiuld ne fa for removal of an official from office, that process requires a majority vote in the House and two-thirds majority vote in the Senate.

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school is to learn about the American democratic system and how it works. I think this is the most important thing because the system affects all of our lives in a direct way, and we should know who does what and why. We have seen the result of ignorance about this system in many peoples' belief that Trump won the election and will be reinstated as President.

First, the belief that Trump won. Regardless of how much direct knowledge of the voting process one has, it is beyond doubt that the courts have reviewed over 60 lawsuits alleging fraud and have dismissed or ruled against every single one. The Supreme Court did not choose to reverse any of those rulings. In our system of government, the matter ends there. Only persons ignorant of the constitution could think that there is still a way to reverse the election results.
Secondly, the belief that Trump will be reinstated as President is based in ignorance of the United States Constitution.
 There is no ""reinstatement clause,"" and anyone who thinks there is, again, is ignorant of the Constitution upon which the US government is based. Although there is an impeachment process (with which Trump supporters should ne familiar, their candidate having been impeached twice) for removal of an official from office, that process requires a majority vote in the House and two-thirds majority vote in the Senate.

We have seen the result of ignorance about this system in many peoples' belief that Trump won the election and will be reinstated as President.

First, the belief that Trump won. Regardless of how much direct knowledge of the voting process one has, it is beyond doubt that the courts have reviewed over 60 lawsuits alleging fraud and have dismissed or ruled against every single one. The Supreme Court did not choose to reverse any of those rulings. In our system of government, the matter ends there. Only persons ignorant of the constitution could think that there is still a way to reverse the election results.
Secondly, the belief that Trump will be reinstated as President is based in ignorance of the United States Constitution.
 There is no ""reinstatement clause,"" and anyone who thinks there is, again, is ignorant of the Constitution upon which the US government is based. Although there is an impeachment process (with which Trump supporters should ne familiar, their candidate having been impeached twice) for removal of an official from office, that process requires a majority vote in the House and two-thirds majority vote in the Senate. 

So the belief that Trump will be reinstated as President only serves to highlight the ignorance of the people who hold it. This belief is the principle reason I think teaching people how our system works is the most important thing we can be learning in school. If peopl",2031,[],0,1,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1184

Regardless of how much direct knowledge of the voting process one has, it is beyond doubt that the courts have reviewed over 60 lawsuits alleging fraud and have dismissed or ruled against every single one. The Supreme Court did not choose to reverse any of those rulings. In our system of government, the matter ends there. Only persons ignorant of the constitution could think that there is still a way to reverse the election results.
Secondly, the belief that Trump will be reinstated as President is based in ignorance of the United States Constitution.
 There is no ""reinstatement clause,"" and anyone who thinks there is, again, is ignorant of the Constitution upon which the US government is based. Although there is an impeachment process (with which Trump supporters should ne familiar, their candidate having been impeached twice) for removal of an official from office, that process requires a majority vote in the House and two-thirds majority vote in the Senate. 

So the belief that Trump will be reinstated as President only serves to highlight the ignorance of the people who hold it.

I think this is the most important thing because the system affects all of our lives in a direct way, and we should know who does what and why. We have seen the result of ignorance about this system in many peoples' belief that Trump won the election and will be reinstated as President.

First, the belief that Trump won. Regardless of how much direct knowledge of the voting process one has, it is beyond doubt that the courts have reviewed over 60 lawsuits alleging fraud and have dismissed or ruled against every single one. The Supreme Court did not choose to reverse any of those rulings. In our system of government, the matter ends there. Only persons ignorant of the constitution could think that there is still a way to reverse the election results.
Secondly, the belief that Trump will be reinstated as President is based in ignorance of the United States Constitution.
 There is no ""reinstatement clause,"" and anyone who thinks there is, again, is ignorant of the Constitution upon which the US government is based. Although there is an impeachment process (with which Trump supporters should ne familiar, their candidate having been impeached twice) for removal of an official from office, that process requires a majority vote in the House and two-thirds majority vote in the Senate. 

So the belief that Trump will be reinstated as President only serves to highlight the ignorance of the people who hold it. This belief is the principle reason I think teaching people how our system works is the most important thing we can be learning in school.

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school is to learn about the American democratic system and how it works. I think this is the most important thing because the system affects all of our lives in a direct way, and we should know who does what and why. We have seen the result of ignorance about this system in many peoples' belief that Trump won the election and will be reinstated as President.

First, the belief that Trump won. Regardless of how much direct knowledge of the voting process one has, it is beyond doubt that the courts have reviewed over 60 lawsuits alleging fraud and have dismissed or ruled against every single one. The Supreme Court did not choose to reverse any of those rulings. In our system of government, the matter ends there. Only persons ignorant of the constitution could think that there is still a way to reverse the election results.
Secondly, the belief that Trump will be reinstated as President is based in ignorance of the United States Constitution.
 There is no ""reinstatement clause,"" and anyone who thinks there is, again, is ignorant of the Constitution upon which the US government is based. Although there is an impeachment process (with which Trump supporters should ne familiar, their candidate having been impeached twice) for removal of an official from office, that process requires a majority vote in the House and two-thirds majority vote in the Senate. 

So the belief that Trump will be reinstated as President only serves to highlight the ignorance of the people who hold it.

The Supreme Court did not choose to reverse any of those rulings. In our system of government, the matter ends there.

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school is to learn about the American democratic system and how it works. I think this is the most important thing because the system affects all of our lives in a direct way, and we should know who does what and why. We have seen the result of ignorance about this system in many peoples' belief that Trump won the election and will be reinstated as President.

First, the belief that Trump won. Regardless of how much direct knowledge of the voting process one has, it is beyond doubt that the courts have reviewed over 60 lawsuits alleging fraud and have dismissed or ruled against every single one. The Supreme Court did not choose to reverse any of those rulings. In our system of government, the matter ends there. Only persons ignorant of the constitution could think that there is still a way to reverse the election results.
Secondly, the belief that Trump will be reinstated as President is based in ignorance of the United States Constitution.
 There is no ""reinstatement clause,"" and anyone who thinks there is, again, is ignorant of the Constitution upon which the US government is based. Although there is an impeachment process (with which Trump supporters should ne familiar, their candidate having been impeached twice) for removal of an official from office, that process requires a majority vote in the House and two-thirds majority vote in the Senate. 

So the belief that Trump will be reinstated as President only serves to highlight the ignorance of the people who hold it. This belief is the principle reason I think teaching people how our system works is the most important thing we can be learning in school. If people knew about and supported the American democratic system none of this Trumpian foolishness would ever have had happened.",398,[],0,1,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1311

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school is the American democratic system and how it works. I think this is the most important thing because the system affects all of our lives in a direct way, and we should know who does what and why. We have seen the result of ignorance about this system in many peoples' belief that Trump won the election and that he will be reinstated as President.

First, the belief that Trump won. Regardless of how much direct knowledge of the voting process one has, it is beyond doubt that the courts have reviewed over 60 lawsuits alleging fraud and have dismissed or ruled against every single one. The Supreme Court did not choose to reverse any of those rulings. In our system of government, the matter ends there. Only persons ignorant of the constitution could think that there is still a way to reverse the election results.
Secondly, the belief that Trump will be reinstated as President is based in ignorance of the United States Constitution.
 There is no ""reinstatement clause,"" and anyone who thinks there is, again, is ignorant of the Constitution upon which the US government is based. Although there is an impeachment process (with which Trump supporters should ne familiar, their candidate having been impeached twice) for removal of an official from office, that process requires a majority vote in the House and two-thirds majority vote in the Senate. 

So the belief that Trump will be reinstated as President only serves to highlight the ignorance of the people who hold it.
