That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved.

The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.

That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.

That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species. We're still working on that connection with other animals such as cats, but it will get there. And that bond is not possible with a stranger. That bond would take time to develop.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species. We're still working on that connection with other animals such as cats, but it will get there. And that bond is not possible with a stranger. That bond would take time to develop.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species. We're still working on that connection with other animals such as cats, but it will get there. And that bond is not possible with a stranger. That bond would take time to develop.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger.

 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal.

That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species. We're still working on that connection with other animals such as cats, but it will get there. And that bond is not possible with a stranger. That bond would take time to develop.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species. We're still working on that connection with other animals such as cats, but it will get there. And that bond is not possible with a stranger. That bond would take time to develop.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species. We're still working on that connection with other animals such as cats, but it will get there. And that bond is not possible with a stranger. That bond would take time to develop.

Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species. We're still working on that connection with other animals such as cats, but it will get there. And that bond is not possible with a stranger. That bond would take time to develop.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species. We're still working on that connection with other animals such as cats, but it will get there. And that bond is not possible with a stranger. That bond would take time to develop.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species. We're still working on that connection with other animals such as cats, but it will get there. And that bond is not possible with a stranger. That bond would take time to develop. 

So there's nothing wrong with focusing more on animal welfare in general. Animals can not take care of themselves in many cases and need our help. Animal c",2168,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1569

The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger.

 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger.

 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.

The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species. We're still working on that connection with other animals such as cats, but it will get there. And that bond is not possible with a stranger. That bond would take time to develop. 

So there's nothing wrong with focusing more on animal welfare in general. Animals can not take care of themselves in many cases and need our help. Animal charities are often overlooked.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species. We're still working on that connection with other animals such as cats, but it will get there. And that bond is not possible with a stranger. That bond would take time to develop.

 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species. We're still working on that connection with other animals such as cats, but it will get there. And that bond is not possible with a stranger. That bond would take time to develop. 

So there's nothing wrong with focusing more on animal welfare in general. Animals can not take care of themselves in many cases and need our help. Animal charities are often overlooked.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species. We're still working on that connection with other animals such as cats, but it will get there. And that bond is not possible with a stranger. That bond would take time to develop.

The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species. We're still working on that connection with other animals such as cats, but it will get there. And that bond is not possible with a stranger. That bond would take time to develop. 

So there's nothing wrong with focusing more on animal welfare in general. Animals can not take care of themselves in many cases and need our help. Animal charities are often overlooked. It's our responsibility to take care of animals as they rely on us. There's no reason to feel bad about it, it's just the way that some o",2336,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1749

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species. We're still working on that connection with other animals such as cats, but it will get there. And that bond is not possible with a stranger. That bond would take time to develop. 

So there's nothing wrong with focusing more on animal welfare in general. Animals can not take care of themselves in many cases and need our help. Animal charities are often overlooked. It's our responsibility to take care of animals as they rely on us. There's no reason to feel bad about it, it's just the way ",2325,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1776

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species. We're still working on that connection with other animals such as cats, but it will get there. And that bond is not possible with a stranger. That bond would take time to develop. 

So there's nothing wrong with focusing more on animal welfare in general. Animals can not take care of themselves in many cases and need our help. Animal charities are often overlooked.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species. We're still working on that connection with other animals such as cats, but it will get there. And that bond is not possible with a stranger. That bond would take time to develop. 

So there's nothing wrong with focusing more on animal welfare in general. Animals can not take care of themselves in many cases and need our help. Animal charities are often overlooked. It's our responsibility to take care of animals as they rely on us. There's no reason to feel bad about choosing to help animals over a ",2335,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1830

Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species. We're still working on that connection with other animals such as cats, but it will get there. And that bond is not possible with a stranger. That bond would take time to develop. 

So there's nothing wrong with focusing more on animal welfare in general. Animals can not take care of themselves in many cases and need our help. Animal charities are often overlooked. It's our responsibility to take care of animals as they rely on us. There's no reason to feel bad about choosing to help animals over a person. At le",2348,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1843

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species. We're still working on that connection with other animals such as cats, but it will get there. And that bond is not possible with a stranger. That bond would take time to develop. 

So there's nothing wrong with focusing more on animal welfare in general. Animals can not take care of themselves in many cases and need our help. Animal charities are often overlooked. It's our responsibility to take care of animals as they rely on us. There's no reason to feel bad about choosing to help animals over a person.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species. We're still working on that connection with other animals such as cats, but it will get there. And that bond is not possible with a stranger. That bond would take time to develop. 

So there's nothing wrong with focusing more on animal welfare in general. Animals can not take care of themselves in many cases and need our help. Animal charities are often overlooked. It's our responsibility to take care of animals as they rely on us. There's no reason to feel bad about choosing to help animals over a person.

 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species. We're still working on that connection with other animals such as cats, but it will get there. And that bond is not possible with a stranger. That bond would take time to develop. 

So there's nothing wrong with focusing more on animal welfare in general. Animals can not take care of themselves in many cases and need our help. Animal charities are often overlooked.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species.
