In my opinion, listening to an audiobook is every bit, if not better than reading an actual book for many reasons. he first and most obvious is that listening to audiobooks generally requires less attention.
 I don't know about everyone else, but as far as I'm concerned, reading lines on a page can make my eyes tired and my mind wander. When I listen to an audiobook, my focus doesn't have to be so strained that I can't keep it. In other words, I remember what I've listened to better than what I have read. I'm sure if I feel this way there are countless others who agree and also benefit from audiobook listening. 

Another benefit to listening to an audiobook is its portability. I can pick up nearly ANYWHERE and listen. I don't have to worry about getting the pages of a book dirty if I'm outside. Also by listening I can multi-task, such as keep the book on in the background while I am doing other things. Taking an afternoon walk while listening to a book is actually a delightful activity. 

Another obvious benefit of audiobooks to many is the increased accessibility for the vision impaired. Books in braille can be expensive, but now people can find nearly any book in an audio version and listen to it.    

My final major point is that sometimes it's just easier to listen to a story. Sometimes at the end of a hard day I want more than anything to relax. A",1635,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1288

When I listen to an audiobook, my focus doesn't have to be so strained that I can't keep it. In other words, I remember what I've listened to better than what I have read. I'm sure if I feel this way there are countless others who agree and also benefit from audiobook listening. 

Another benefit to listening to an audiobook is its portability. I can pick up nearly ANYWHERE and listen. I don't have to worry about getting the pages of a book dirty if I'm outside.

Another obvious benefit of audiobooks to many is the increased accessibility for the vision impaired. Books in braille can be expensive, but now people can find nearly any book in an audio version and listen to it.    

My final major point is that sometimes it's just easier to listen to a story. Sometimes at the end of a long, hard day I want more than anything to relax.

When I listen to an audiobook, my focus doesn't have to be so strained that I can't keep it. In other words, I remember what I've listened to better than what I have read. I'm sure if I feel this way there are countless others who agree and also benefit from audiobook listening. 

Another benefit to listening to an audiobook is its portability. I can pick up nearly ANYWHERE and listen. I don't have to worry about getting the pages of a book dirty if I'm outside.

My final major point is that sometimes it's just easier to listen to a story. Sometimes at the end of a long, hard day I want more than anything to relax.

In my opinion, listening to an audiobook is every bit, if not better than reading an actual book for many reasons. he first and most obvious is that listening to audiobooks generally requires less attention.
 I don't know about everyone else, but as far as I'm concerned, reading lines on a page can make my eyes tired and my mind wander. When I listen to an audiobook, my focus doesn't have to be so strained that I can't keep it. In other words, I remember what I've listened to better than what I have read. I'm sure if I feel this way there are countless others who agree and also benefit from audiobook listening. 

Another benefit to listening to an audiobook is its portability. I can pick up nearly ANYWHERE and listen. I don't have to worry about getting the pages of a book dirty if I'm outside. Also by listening I can multi-task, such as keep the book on in the background while I am doing other things. Taking an afternoon walk while listening to a book is actually a delightful activity. 

Another obvious benefit of audiobooks to many is the increased accessibility for the vision impaired. Books in braille can be expensive, but now people can find nearly any book in an audio version and listen to it.    

My final major point is that sometimes it's just easier to listen to a story. Sometimes at the end of a long, hard day I want more than anything to relax. Audiobooks allow me to enjoy the experience of a book without having to exert the energy of holding a book up or strain my eyes that are tired from looking at a screen all day.

In my opinion, listening to an audiobook is every bit, if not better than reading an actual book for many reasons. he first and most obvious is that listening to audiobooks generally requires less attention.
 I don't know about everyone else, but as far as I'm concerned, reading lines on a page can make my eyes tired and my mind wander. When I listen to an audiobook, my focus doesn't have to be so strained that I can't keep it. In other words, I remember what I've listened to better than what I have read. I'm sure if I feel this way there are countless others who agree and also benefit from audiobook listening. 

Another benefit to listening to an audiobook is its portability. I can pick up nearly ANYWHERE and listen. I don't have to worry about getting the pages of a book dirty if I'm outside. Also by listening I can multi-task, such as keep the book on in the background while I am doing other things. Taking an afternoon walk while listening to a book is actually a delightful activity. 

Another obvious benefit of audiobooks to many is the increased accessibility for the vision impaired. Books in braille can be expensive, but now people can find nearly any book in an audio version and listen to it.    

My final major point is that sometimes it's just easier to listen to a story. Sometimes at the end of a long, hard day I want more than anything to relax. Audiobooks allow me to enjoy the experience of a book without having to exert the energy of holding a book up or strain my eyes that are tired from looking at a screen all day.

Another benefit to listening to an audiobook is its portability. I can pick up nearly ANYWHERE and listen. I don't have to worry about getting the pages of a book dirty if I'm outside. Also by listening I can multi-task, such as keep the book on in the background while I am doing other things. Taking an afternoon walk while listening to a book is actually a delightful activity. 

Another obvious benefit of audiobooks to many is the increased accessibility for the vision impaired. Books in braille can be expensive, but now people can find nearly any book in an audio version and listen to it.

Audiobooks allow me to enjoy the experience of a book without having to exert the energy of holding a book up or strain my eyes that are tired from looking at a screen all day.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?
