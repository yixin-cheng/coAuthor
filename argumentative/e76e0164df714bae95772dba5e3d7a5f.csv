In my opinion, characters who are young and in love are often over generalized too much.  People are unique and handle relationship issues differently. MUST every young straight couple be Thin and beautiful. Can't one of the couple be thin, and the other normal? Or someone heavy with someone thin. I like contrast and the story would be richer with more contrasts instead of homogenizing everything so.
How about this, to avoid cringing; have someone, of similar age, but different educational and physical ability in love with someone who is able bodied? We never see such things, yet they exist? Why can't we see real things that represent real America?

I also cringe when people kiss constantly, and just walk hand in hand? When people do such things in real life, it's a spectacle. Why do such cringeworthy things gain acceptance on TV? 
I also cringe when people are so beautiful, and have perfect skin, and perfect teeth.

MUST every young straight couple be Thin and beautiful. Can't one of the couple be thin, and the other normal? Or someone heavy with someone thin. I like contrast and the story would be richer with more contrasts instead of homogenizing everything so.
How about this, to avoid cringing; have someone, of similar age, but different educational and physical ability in love with someone who is able bodied? We never see such things, yet they exist? Why can't we see real things that represent real America?

I also cringe when people kiss constantly, and just walk hand in hand? When people do such things in real life, it's a spectacle. Why do such cringeworthy things gain acceptance on TV? 
I also cringe when people are so beautiful, and have perfect skin, and perfect teeth.
 Few people of normal life are this way. What about people who are too poor to afford plastic surgery, or the latest spa treatments. Also, what is the deal with Waxing, and spas? I think with Covid few people do these things. Why not portray folks in covid  times as ungroomed (at least professionally?).  I often change the channel if there is too much model like perfection.  It's so hard to feel sorry for a character when they are perfect in appearance, no flaws. Please, I don't really care if they can't afford the latest edition of the I Phone.

MUST every young straight couple be Thin and beautiful. Can't one of the couple be thin, and the other normal? Or someone heavy with someone thin. I like contrast and the story would be richer with more contrasts instead of homogenizing everything so.
How about this, to avoid cringing; have someone, of similar age, but different educational and physical ability in love with someone who is able bodied? We never see such things, yet they exist? Why can't we see real things that represent real America?

I also cringe when people kiss constantly, and just walk hand in hand? When people do such things in real life, it's a spectacle. Why do such cringeworthy things gain acceptance on TV? 
I also cringe when people are so beautiful, and have perfect skin, and perfect teeth.
 Few people of normal life are this way. What about people who are too poor to afford plastic surgery, or the latest spa treatments. Also, what is the deal with Waxing, and spas? I think with Covid few people do these things. Why not portray folks in covid  times as ungroomed (at least professionally?).  I often change the channel if there is too much model like perfection.  It's so hard to feel sorry for a character when they are perfect in appearance, no flaws. Please, I don't really care if they can't afford the latest edition of the I Phone. REally, I don't.

In my opinion, characters who are young and in love are often over generalized too much.  People are unique and handle relationship issues differently. MUST every young straight couple be Thin and beautiful. Can't one of the couple be thin, and the other normal? Or someone heavy with someone thin. I like contrast and the story would be richer with more contrasts instead of homogenizing everything so.
How about this, to avoid cringing; have someone, of similar age, but different educational and physical ability in love with someone who is able bodied? We never see such things, yet they exist? Why can't we see real things that represent real America?

I also cringe when people kiss constantly, and just walk hand in hand? When people do such things in real life, it's a spectacle. Why do such cringeworthy things gain acceptance on TV? 
I also cringe when people are so beautiful, and have perfect skin, and perfect teeth.
 Few people of normal life are this way. What about people who are too poor to afford plastic surgery, or the latest spa treatments. Also, what is the deal with Waxing, and spas? I think with Covid few people do these things. Why not portray folks in covid  times as ungroomed (at least professionally?).  I often change the channel if there is too much model like perfection.  It's so hard to feel sorry for a character when they are perfect in appearance, no flaws. Please, I don't really care if they can't afford the latest edition of the I Phone. REally, I don't.

In my opinion, characters who are young and in love are often over generalized too much.  People are unique and handle relationship issues differently. MUST every young straight couple be Thin and beautiful. Can't one of the couple be thin, and the other normal? Or someone heavy with someone thin. I like contrast and the story would be richer with more contrasts instead of homogenizing everything so.
How about this, to avoid cringing; have someone, of similar age, but different educational and physical ability in love with someone who is able bodied? We never see such things, yet they exist? Why can't we see real things that represent real America?

I also cringe when people kiss constantly, and just walk hand in hand? When people do such things in real life, it's a spectacle. Why do such cringeworthy things gain acceptance on TV? 
I also cringe when people are so beautiful, and have perfect skin, and perfect teeth.
 Few people of normal life are this way. What about people who are too poor to afford plastic surgery, or the latest spa treatments. Also, what is the deal with Waxing, and spas? I think with Covid few people do these things. Why not portray folks in covid  times as ungroomed (at least professionally?).  I often change the channel if there is too much model like perfection.  It's so hard to feel sorry for a character when they are perfect in appearance, no flaws. Please, I don't really care if they can't afford the latest edition of the I Phone. REally, I don't.

MUST every young straight couple be Thin and beautiful. Can't one of the couple be thin, and the other normal? Or someone heavy with someone thin. I like contrast and the story would be richer with more contrasts instead of homogenizing everything so.
How about this, to avoid cringing; have someone, of similar age, but different educational and physical ability in love with someone who is able bodied? We never see such things, yet they exist? Why can't we see real things that represent real America?

I also cringe when people kiss constantly, and just walk hand in hand? When people do such things in real life, it's a spectacle. Why do such cringeworthy things gain acceptance on TV? 
I also cringe when people are so beautiful, and have perfect skin, and perfect teeth.
 Few people of normal life are this way. What about people who are too poor to afford plastic surgery, or the latest spa treatments. Also, what is the deal with Waxing, and spas? I think with Covid few people do these things. Why not portray folks in covid  times as ungroomed (at least professionally?).  I often change the channel if there is too much model like perfection.  It's so hard to feel sorry for a character when they are perfect in appearance, no flaws. Please, I don't really care if they can't afford the latest edition of the I Phone. REally, I don't.

In my opinion, characters who are young and in love are often over generalized too much.  People are unique and handle relationship issues differently. MUST every young straight couple be Thin and beautiful. Can't one of the couple be thin, and the other normal? Or someone heavy with someone thin. I like contrast and the story would be richer with more contrasts instead of homogenizing everything so.
How about this, to avoid cringing; have someone, of similar age, but different educational and physical ability in love with someone who is able bodied? We never see such things, yet they exist? Why can't we see real things that represent real America?

I also cringe when people kiss constantly, and just walk hand in hand? When people do such things in real life, it's a spectacle. Why do such cringeworthy things gain acceptance on TV? 
I also cringe when people are so beautiful, and have perfect skin, and perfect teeth.
 Few people of normal life are this way. What about people who are too poor to afford plastic surgery, or the latest spa treatments. Also, what is the deal with Waxing, and spas? I think with Covid few people do these things. Why not portray folks in covid  times as ungroomed (at least professionally?).  I often change the channel if there is too much model like perfection.  It's so hard to feel sorry for a character when they are perfect in appearance, no flaws. Please, I don't really care if they can't afford the latest edition of the I Phone. REally, I don't.

In my opinion, characters who are young and in love are often over generalized too much.  People are unique and handle relationship issues differently. MUST every young straight couple be Thin and beautiful. Can't one of the couple be thin, and the other normal? Or someone heavy with someone thin. I like contrast and the story would be richer with more contrasts instead of homogenizing everything so.
How about this, to avoid cringing; have someone, of similar age, but different educational and physical ability in love with someone who is able bodied? We never see such things, yet they exist? Why can't we see real things that represent real America?

I also cringe when people kiss constantly, and just walk hand in hand? When people do such things in real life, it's a spectacle. Why do such cringeworthy things gain acceptance on TV? 
I also cringe when people are so beautiful, and have perfect skin, and perfect teeth.
 Few people of normal life are this way. What about people who are too poor to afford plastic surgery, or the latest spa treatments. Also, what is the deal with Waxing, and spas? I think with Covid few people do these things. Why not portray folks in covid  times as ungroomed (at least professionally?).  I often change the channel if there is too much model like perfection.  It's so hard to feel sorry for a character when they are perfect in appearance, no flaws. Please, I don't really care if they can't afford the latest edition of the I Phone. REally, I don't.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, characters who are young and in love are often over generalized too much.  People are unique and handle relationship issues differently. MUST every young straight couple be Thin and beautiful. Can't one of the couple be thin, and the other normal? Or someone heavy with someone thin. I like contrast and the story would be richer with more contrasts instead of homogenizing everything so.
How about this, to avoid cringing; have someone, of similar age, but different educational and physical ability in love with someone who is able bodied? We never see such things, yet they exist? Why can't we see real things that represent real America?

I also cringe when people kiss constantly, and just walk hand in hand? When people do such things in real life, it's a spectacle. Why do such cringeworthy things gain acceptance on TV? 
I also cringe when people are so beautiful, and have perfect skin, and perfect teeth.
 Few people of normal life are this way. What about people who are too poor to afford plastic surgery, or the latest spa treatments. Also, what is the deal with Waxing, and spas? I think with Covid few people do these things. Why not portray folks in covid  times as ungroomed (at least professionally?).  I often change the channel if there is too much model like perfection.  It's so hard to feel sorry for a character when they are perfect in appearance, no flaws. Please, I don't really care if they can't afford the latest edition of the I Phone. REally, I don't.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, characters who are young and in love are often over generalized too much.  People are unique and handle relationship issues differently. MUST every young straight couple be Thin and beautiful. Can't one of the couple be thin, and the other normal? Or someone heavy with someone thin. I like contrast and the story would be richer with more contrasts instead of homogenizing everything so.
How about this, to avoid cringing; have someone, of similar age, but different educational and physical ability in love with someone who is able bodied? We never see such things, yet they exist? Why can't we see real things that represent real America?

I also cringe when people kiss constantly, and just walk hand in hand? When people do such things in real life, it's a spectacle. Why do such cringeworthy things gain acceptance on TV? 
I also cringe when people are so beautiful, and have perfect skin, and perfect teeth.
 Few people of normal life are this way. What about people who are too poor to afford plastic surgery, or the latest spa treatments. Also, what is the deal with Waxing, and spas? I think with Covid few people do these things. Why not portray folks in covid  times as ungroomed (at least professionally?).  I often change the channel if there is too much model like perfection.  It's so hard to feel sorry for a character when they are perfect in appearance, no flaws. Please, I don't really care if they can't afford the latest edition of the I Phone. REally, I don't. 

I'm curious about how normal people live. Here's what I think a producer should do, to avoid some of these cringeworthy things. FORGET about casting the latest model thin actor/actress.

In my opinion, characters who are young and in love are often over generalized too much.  People are unique and handle relationship issues differently. MUST every young straight couple be Thin and beautiful. Can't one of the couple be thin, and the other normal? Or someone heavy with someone thin. I like contrast and the story would be richer with more contrasts instead of homogenizing everything so.
How about this, to avoid cringing; have someone, of similar age, but different educational and physical ability in love with someone who is able bodied? We never see such things, yet they exist? Why can't we see real things that represent real America?

I also cringe when people kiss constantly, and just walk hand in hand? When people do such things in real life, it's a spectacle. Why do such cringeworthy things gain acceptance on TV? 
I also cringe when people are so beautiful, and have perfect skin, and perfect teeth.
 Few people of normal life are this way. What about people who are too poor to afford plastic surgery, or the latest spa treatments. Also, what is the deal with Waxing, and spas? I think with Covid few people do these things. Why not portray folks in covid  times as ungroomed (at least professionally?).  I often change the channel if there is too much model like perfection.  It's so hard to feel sorry for a character when they are perfect in appearance, no flaws. Please, I don't really care if they can't afford the latest edition of the I Phone. REally, I don't. 

I'm curious about how normal people live. Here's what I think a producer should do, to avoid some of these cringeworthy things. FORGET about casting the latest model thin actor/actress. Try for once to cast someone who is an actual Theater geek in high school college, just a normal young or old person who has talents but lives a life being overlooked.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, characters who are young and in love are often over generalized too much.  People are unique and handle relationship issues differently. MUST every young straight couple be Thin and beautiful. Can't one of the couple be thin, and the other normal? Or someone heavy with someone thin. I like contrast and the story would be richer with more contrasts instead of homogenizing everything so.
How about this, to avoid cringing; have someone, of similar age, but different educational and physical ability in love with someone who is able bodied? We never see such things, yet they exist? Why can't we see real things that represent real America?

I also cringe when people kiss constantly, and just walk hand in hand? When people do such things in real life, it's a spectacle. Why do such cringeworthy things gain acceptance on TV? 
I also cringe when people are so beautiful, and have perfect skin, and perfect teeth.
 Few people of normal life are this way. What about people who are too poor to afford plastic surgery, or the latest spa treatments. Also, what is the deal with Waxing, and spas? I think with Covid few people do these things. Why not portray folks in covid  times as ungroomed (at least professionally?).  I often change the channel if there is too much model like perfection.  It's so hard to feel sorry for a character when they are perfect in appearance, no flaws. Please, I don't really care if they can't afford the latest edition of the I Phone. REally, I don't. 

I'm curious about how normal people live. Here's what I think a producer should do, to avoid some of these cringeworthy things. FORGET about casting the latest model thin actor/actress.

MUST every young straight couple be Thin and beautiful. Can't one of the couple be thin, and the other normal? Or someone heavy with someone thin.

In my opinion, characters who are young and in love are often over generalized too much.  People are unique and handle relationship issues differently. MUST every young straight couple be Thin and beautiful. Can't one of the couple be thin, and the other normal? Or someone heavy with someone thin. I like contrast and the story would be richer with more contrasts instead of homogenizing everything so.
How about this, to avoid cringing; have someone, of similar age, but different educational and physical ability in love with someone who is able bodied? We never see such things, yet they exist? Why can't we see real things that represent real America?

I also cringe when people kiss constantly, and just walk hand in hand? When people do such things in real life, it's a spectacle. Why do such cringeworthy things gain acceptance on TV?

How about this, to avoid cringing; have someone, of similar age, but different educational and physical ability in love with someone who is able bodied? We never see such things, yet they exist? Why can't we see real things that represent real America?

In my opinion, characters who are young and in love are often over generalized too much.  People are unique and handle relationship issues differently. MUST every young straight couple be Thin and beautiful. Can't one of the couple be thin, and the other normal? Or someone heavy with someone thin. I like contrast and the story would be richer with more contrasts instead of homogenizing everything so.
How about this, to avoid cringing; have someone, of similar age, but different educational and physical ability in love with someone who is able bodied? We never see such things, yet they exist? Why can't we see real things that represent real America?

I also cringe when people kiss constantly, and just walk hand in hand? When people do such things in real life, it's a spectacle. Why do such cringeworthy things gain acceptance on TV? 
I also cringe when people are so beautiful, and have perfect skin, and perfect teeth.
 Few people of normal life are this way. What about people who are too poor to afford plastic surgery, or the latest spa treatments. Also, what is the deal with Waxing, and spas? I think with Covid few people do these things. Why not portray folks in covid  times as ungroomed (at least professionally?).  I often change the channel if there is too much model like perfection.  It's so hard to feel sorry for a character when they are perfect in appearance, no flaws. Please, I don't really care if they can't afford the latest edition of the I Phone. REally, I don't. 

I'm curious about how normal people live. Here's what I think a producer should do, to avoid some of these cringeworthy things. FORGET about casting the latest model thin actor/actress.

In my opinion, characters who are young and in love are often over generalized too much.  People are unique and handle relationship issues differently. MUST every young straight couple be Thin and beautiful. Can't one of the couple be thin, and the other normal? Or someone heavy with someone thin. I like contrast and the story would be richer with more contrasts instead of homogenizing everything so.
How about this, to avoid cringing; have someone, of similar age, but different educational and physical ability in love with someone who is able bodied? We never see such things, yet they exist? Why can't we see real things that represent real America?

I also cringe when people kiss constantly, and just walk hand in hand? When people do such things in real life, it's a spectacle. Why do such cringeworthy things gain acceptance on TV? 
I also cringe when people are so beautiful, and have perfect skin, and perfect teeth.
 Few people of normal life are this way. What about people who are too poor to afford plastic surgery, or the latest spa treatments. Also, what is the deal with Waxing, and spas? I think with Covid few people do these things. Why not portray folks in covid  times as ungroomed (at least professionally?).  I often change the channel if there is too much model like perfection.  It's so hard to feel sorry for a character when they are perfect in appearance, no flaws. Please, I don't really care if they can't afford the latest edition of the I Phone. REally, I don't.

In my opinion, characters who are young and in love are often over generalized too much.  People are unique and handle relationship issues differently. MUST every young straight couple be Thin and beautiful. Can't one of the couple be thin, and the other normal? Or someone heavy with someone thin. I like contrast and the story would be richer with more contrasts instead of homogenizing everything so.
How about this, to avoid cringing; have someone, of similar age, but different educational and physical ability in love with someone who is able bodied? We never see such things, yet they exist? Why can't we see real things that represent real America?

I also cringe when people kiss constantly, and just walk hand in hand? When people do such things in real life, it's a spectacle. Why do such cringeworthy things gain acceptance on TV? 
I also cringe when people are so beautiful, and have perfect skin, and perfect teeth.
 Few people of normal life are this way. What about people who are too poor to afford plastic surgery, or the latest spa treatments. Also, what is the deal with Waxing, and spas? I think with Covid few people do these things. Why not portray folks in covid  times as ungroomed (at least professionally?).  I often change the channel if there is too much model like perfection.  It's so hard to feel sorry for a character when they are perfect in appearance, no flaws. Please, I don't really care if they can't afford the latest edition of the I Phone. REally, I don't. 

I'm curious about how normal people live. Here's what I think a producer should do, to avoid some of these cringeworthy things. FORGET about casting the latest model thin actor/actress.

In my opinion, characters who are young and in love are often over generalized too much.  People are unique and handle relationship issues differently. MUST every young straight couple be Thin and beautiful. Can't one of the couple be thin, and the other normal? Or someone heavy with someone thin. I like contrast and the story would be richer with more contrasts instead of homogenizing everything so.
How about this, to avoid cringing; have someone, of similar age, but different educational and physical ability in love with someone who is able bodied? We never see such things, yet they exist? Why can't we see real things that represent real America?

I also cringe when people kiss constantly, and just walk hand in hand? When people do such things in real life, it's a spectacle. Why do such cringeworthy things gain acceptance on TV?

MUST every young straight couple be Thin and beautiful. Can't one of the couple be thin, and the other normal? Or someone heavy with someone thin. I like contrast and the story would be richer with more contrasts instead of homogenizing everything so.
How about this, to avoid cringing; have someone, of similar age, but different educational and physical ability in love with someone who is able bodied? We never see such things, yet they exist? Why can't we see real things that represent real America?

I also cringe when people kiss constantly, and just walk hand in hand? When people do such things in real life, it's a spectacle. Why do such cringeworthy things gain acceptance on TV? 
I also cringe when people are so beautiful, and have perfect skin, and perfect teeth.
 Few people of normal life are this way. What about people who are too poor to afford plastic surgery, or the latest spa treatments. Also, what is the deal with Waxing, and spas? I think with Covid few people do these things. Why not portray folks in covid  times as ungroomed (at least professionally?).  I often change the channel if there is too much model like perfection.  It's so hard to feel sorry for a character when they are perfect in appearance, no flaws. Please, I don't really care if they can't afford the latest edition of the I Phone. Really, I don't. 

I'm curious about how normal people live. Here's what I think a producer should do, to avoid some of these cringeworthy things. FORGET about casting the latest model thin actor/actress. Try for once to cast someone who is an actual Theater geek in high school college, just a normal young or old person who has talents but lives a life being overlooked. Make that person an actual star, in many ways, a sort of cinderella in real life story.

In my opinion, characters who are young and in love are often over generalized too much.  People are unique and handle relationship issues differently. MUST every young straight couple be Thin and beautiful. Can't one of the couple be thin, and the other normal? Or someone heavy with someone thin. I like contrast and the story would be richer with more contrasts instead of homogenizing everything so.
How about this, to avoid cringing; have someone, of similar age, but different educational and physical ability in love with someone who is able bodied? We never see such things, yet they exist? Why can't we see real things that represent real America?

I also cringe when people kiss constantly, and just walk hand in hand? When people do such things in real life, it's a spectacle. Why do such cringeworthy things gain acceptance on TV? 
I also cringe when people are so beautiful, and have perfect skin, and perfect teeth.
 Few people of normal life are this way. What about people who are too poor to afford plastic surgery, or the latest spa treatments. Also, what is the deal with Waxing, and spas? I think with Covid few people do these things. Why not portray folks in covid  times as ungroomed (at least professionally?).  I often change the channel if there is too much model like perfection.  It's so hard to feel sorry for a character when they are perfect in appearance, no flaws. Please, I don't really care if they can't afford the latest edition of the I Phone. Really, I don't. 

I'm curious about how normal people live. Here's what I think a producer should do, to avoid some of these cringeworthy things. FORGET about casting the latest model thin actor/actress. Try for once to cast someone who is an actual Theater geek in high school college, just a normal young or old person who has talents but lives a life being overlooked.

In my opinion, characters who are young and in love are often over generalized too much.  People are unique and handle relationship issues differently. MUST every young straight couple be Thin and beautiful. Can't one of the couple be thin, and the other normal? Or someone heavy with someone thin. I like contrast and the story would be richer with more contrasts instead of homogenizing everything so.
How about this, to avoid cringing; have someone, of similar age, but different educational and physical ability in love with someone who is able bodied? We never see such things, yet they exist? Why can't we see real things that represent real America?

I also cringe when people kiss constantly, and just walk hand in hand? When people do such things in real life, it's a spectacle. Why do such cringeworthy things gain acceptance on TV? 
I also cringe when people are so beautiful, and have perfect skin, and perfect teeth.
 Few people of normal life are this way. What about people who are too poor to afford plastic surgery, or the latest spa treatments. Also, what is the deal with Waxing, and spas? I think with Covid few people do these things. Why not portray folks in covid  times as ungroomed (at least professionally?).  I often change the channel if there is too much model like perfection.  It's so hard to feel sorry for a character when they are perfect in appearance, no flaws. Please, I don't really care if they can't afford the latest edition of the I Phone. Really, I don't. 

I'm curious about how normal people live. Here's what I think a producer should do, to avoid some of these cringeworthy things. FORGET about casting the latest model thin actor/actress.

I also cringe when people kiss constantly, and just walk hand in hand? When people do such things in real life, it's a spectacle. Why do such cringeworthy things gain acceptance on TV? 
I also cringe when people are so beautiful, and have perfect skin, and perfect teeth.
 Few people of normal life are this way. What about people who are too poor to afford plastic surgery, or the latest spa treatments. Also, what is the deal with Waxing, and spas? I think with Covid few people do these things. Why not portray folks in covid  times as ungroomed (at least professionally?).  I often change the channel if there is too much model like perfection.

I'm curious about how normal people live. Here's what I think a producer should do, to avoid some of these cringeworthy things. FORGET about casting the latest model thin actor/actress.
