In my opinion, some states' prefer to pretend that when it comes to older students sex does not exit. Period shaming is part of that benighted attitude. If anything with the word ""period"" or ""tampon"" appears in a school, then that school has failed in its duty to the state.

The reality is that there are a lot of girls who have periods.
 The bloods gonna flow. It's a fact of life. And in schools where this reality is not addressed, girls with periods can become pariahs. If students judges others for clothing, poverty, race, and social class, what makes us think that girls having periods would not be attacked too?
TIfgirls are not given the tools to deal with their periods, they will be forced to deal with them in a way

In my opinion, some states' prefer to pretend that when it comes to older students sex does not exit. Period shaming is part of that benighted attitude. If anything with the word ""period"" or ""tampon"" appears in a school, then that school has failed in its duty to the state.

The reality is that there are a lot of girls who have periods.
 The bloods gonna flow. It's a fact of life. And in schools where this reality is not addressed, girls with periods can become pariahs. If students judges others for clothing, poverty, race, and social class, what makes us think that girls having periods would not be attacked too?
TIfgirls are not given the tools to deal with their periods, they will be forced to deal with them in a way
 that demeans them and reinforces negative attitudes toward a spectrum of related gender and sexuality issues. Misogyny, poverty, LGBTQ rights: these are real issues in schools, and period poverty is yet another  way to reinforce the marginalization of what should be protected classes.

The reality is that there are a lot of girls who have periods.

In my opinion, some states' prefer to pretend that when it comes to older students sex does not exit. Period shaming is part of that benighted attitude. If anything with the word ""period"" or ""tampon"" appears in a school, then that school has failed in its duty to the state.

But what's the reality here?
The reality is that there are a lot of girls who have periods.
 The bloods gonna flow. It's a fact of life. And in schools where this reality is not addressed, girls with periods can become pariahs. If students judges others for clothing, poverty, race, and social class, what makes us think that girls having periods would not be attacked too?
TIfgirls are not given the tools to deal with their periods, they will be forced to deal with them in a way
 that demeans them and reinforces negative attitudes toward a spectrum of related gender and sexuality issues. Misogyny, poverty, LGBTQ rights: these are real issues in schools, and period poverty is yet another  way to reinforce the marginalization of what should be protected classes.

The reality is that there are a lot of girls who have periods.
 The bloods gonna flow. It's a fact of life. And in schools where this reality is not addressed, girls with periods can become pariahs. If students judges others for clothing, poverty, race, and social class, what makes us think that girls having periods would not be attacked too?
TIfgirls are not given the tools to deal with their periods, they will be forced to deal with them in a way
 that demeans them and reinforces negative attitudes toward a spectrum of related gender and sexuality issues. Misogyny, poverty, LGBTQ rights: these are real issues in schools, and period poverty is yet another  way to reinforce the marginalization of what should be protected classes.
The question is not whether schools should provide pads and tampons.
 Of course they should. But more deeply, will the schools try to protect the weak, the vulnerable, the disenfranchised, the loner? What is the life lesson that period-shaming victims are learning?

 The bloods gonna flow. It's a fact of life. And in schools where this reality is not addressed, girls with periods can become pariahs. If students judges others for clothing, poverty, race, and social class, what makes us think that girls having periods would not be attacked too?
TIfgirls are not given the tools to deal with their periods, they will be forced to deal with them in a way
 that demeans them and reinforces negative attitudes toward a spectrum of related gender and sexuality issues. Misogyny, poverty, LGBTQ rights: these are real issues in schools, and period poverty is yet another  way to reinforce the marginalization of what should be protected classes.
The question is not whether schools should provide pads and tampons.
 Of course they should. But more deeply, will the schools try to protect the weak, the vulnerable, the disenfranchised, the loner? What is the life lesson that period-shaming victims are learning? That they don't count and will likely never count. That they are not worthy of protection. That they are not worthy of empathy. That they are not worthy of respect.

 The bloods gonna flow. It's a fact of life. And in schools where this reality is not addressed, girls with periods can become pariahs. If students judges others for clothing, poverty, race, and social class, what makes us think that girls having periods would not be attacked too?
TIfgirls are not given the tools to deal with their periods, they will be forced to deal with them in a way
 that demeans them and reinforces negative attitudes toward a spectrum of related gender and sexuality issues. Misogyny, poverty, LGBTQ rights: these are real issues in schools, and period poverty is yet another  way to reinforce the marginalization of what should be protected classes.
The question is not whether schools should provide pads and tampons.
 Of course they should. But more deeply, will the schools try to protect the weak, the vulnerable, the disenfranchised, the loner? What is the life lesson that period-shaming victims are learning? That they don't count and will likely never count. That they are not worthy of protection. That they are not worthy of empathy. That they are not worthy of respect.

In my opinion, some states' prefer to pretend that when it comes to older students sex does not exit. Period shaming is part of that benighted attitude. If anything with the word ""period"" or ""tampon"" appears in a school, then that school has failed in its duty to the state.

But what's the reality here?
The reality is that there are a lot of girls who have periods.
 The bloods gonna flow. It's a fact of life. And in schools where this reality is not addressed, girls with periods can become pariahs. If students judges others for clothing, poverty, race, and social class, what makes us think that girls having periods would not be attacked too?
TIfgirls are not given the tools to deal with their periods, they will be forced to deal with them in a way
 that demeans them and reinforces negative attitudes toward a spectrum of related gender and sexuality issues. Misogyny, poverty, LGBTQ rights: these are real issues in schools, and period poverty is yet another  way to reinforce the marginalization of what should be protected classes.
The question is not whether schools should provide pads and tampons.
 Of course they should. But more deeply, will the schools try to protect the weak, the vulnerable, the disenfranchised, the loner? What is the life lesson that period-shaming victims are learning? That they don't count and will likely never count. That they are not worthy of protection. That they are not worthy of empathy. That they are not worthy of respect.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, some states' prefer to pretend that when it comes to older students sex does not exit. Period shaming is part of that benighted attitude. If anything with the word ""period"" or ""tampon"" appears in a school, then that school has failed in its duty to the state.

But what's the reality here?
The reality is that there are a lot of girls who have periods.
 The blood will flow, t's a fact of life. And in schools where this reality is not addressed, girls with periods can become pariahs. If students judges others for clothing, poverty, race, and social class, what makes us think that girls having periods would not be attacked too?
TIfgirls are not given the tools to deal with their periods, they will be forced to deal with them in a way
 that demeans them and reinforces negative attitudes toward a spectrum of related gender and sexuality issues. Misogyny, poverty, LGBTQ rights: these are real issues in schools, and period poverty is yet another  way to reinforce the marginalization of what should be protected classes.
The question is not whether schools should provide pads and tampons.
 Of course they should. But more deeply, will the schools try to protect the weak, the vulnerable, the disenfranchised, the loner? What is the life lesson that period-shaming victims are learning? That they don't count and will likely never count. That they are not worthy of protection. That they are not worthy of empathy. That they are not worthy of respect.
