In my opinion, listening to an audiobook is like looking at a painting without ever seeing it in person. You are technically experiencing it but you are missing out on the fine details that make it special. It's an experience, not just a story. his is not to say that audiobooks are inferior.
 They just are an alternate experience. They just lack the full experience that you otherwise could be having with a book. 
Have you ever listened to an audiobook?
 The process alone is different. You're not using your eyes. You're listening and hearing someone else read the story. You're not hearing it in your head. Instead, you're hearing someone else and their voice emphasizing key parts of the story. It just makes it different. The experience is still valid for sure. It's just different. 

I enjoy listening when I do not have free time to focus specifically to a book. This way I can listen to the story when doing something else. I feel like that's how most people listen, so they can multitask while listening.

In my opinion, listening to an audiobook is like looking at a painting without ever seeing it in person. You are technically experiencing it but you are missing out on the fine details that make it special. It's an experience, not just a story. his is not to say that audiobooks are inferior.
 They just are an alternate experience. They just lack the full experience that you otherwise could be having with a book. 
Have you ever listened to an audiobook?
 The process alone is different. You're not using your eyes. You're listening and hearing someone else read the story. You're not hearing it in your head. Instead, you're hearing someone else and their voice emphasizing key parts of the story. It just makes it different. The experience is still valid for sure. It's just different. 

I enjoy listening when I do not have free time to focus specifically to a book. This way I can listen to the story when doing something else. I feel like that's how most people listen, so they can multitask while listening.
