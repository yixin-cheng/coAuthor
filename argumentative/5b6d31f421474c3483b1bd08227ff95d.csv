In my opinion, audiobooks have two major advantages–they allow you to multitask and/or get through a lot more books in a shorter amount of time. I always have a hard time finding time to read. I also find it hard to focus on the words on the page. Reading in print can be taxing on the eyes, too. Printed books also lead to more paper consumption and waste–and I personally feel it is irresponsible to consume as much paper as we do. Many books are never touched again after being read only one time. What a waste! We can take advantage of technology and use this to reduce paper waste.

In my opinion, audiobooks have two major advantages–they allow you to multitask and/or get through a lot more books in a shorter amount of time. I always have a hard time finding time to read. I also find it hard to focus on the words on the page. Reading in print can be taxing on the eyes, too. Printed books also lead to more paper consumption and waste–and I personally feel it is irresponsible to consume as much paper as we do. Many books are never touched again after being read only one time. What a waste! We can take advantage of technology and use this to reduce paper waste.

In my opinion, audiobooks have two major advantages–they allow you to multitask and/or get through a lot more books in a shorter amount of time. I always have a hard time finding time to read. I also find it hard to focus on the words on the page. Reading in print can be taxing on the eyes, too. Printed books also lead to more paper consumption and waste–and I personally feel it is irresponsible to consume as much paper as we do. Many books are never touched again after being read only one time. What a waste! We can take advantage of technology and use this to reduce paper waste.

In my opinion, audiobooks have two major advantages–they allow you to multitask and/or get through a lot more books in a shorter amount of time. I always have a hard time finding time to read. I also find it hard to focus on the words on the page. Reading in print can be taxing on the eyes, too. Printed books also lead to more paper consumption and waste–and I personally feel it is irresponsible to consume as much paper as we do. Many books are never touched again after being read only one time. What a waste! We can take advantage of technology and use this to reduce paper waste.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, audiobooks have two major advantages–they allow you to multitask and/or get through a lot more books in a shorter amount of time. I always have a hard time finding time to read. I also find it hard to focus on the words on the page. Reading in print can be taxing on the eyes, too. Printed books also lead to more paper consumption and waste–and I personally feel it is irresponsible to consume as much paper as we do. Many books are never touched again after being read only one time. What a waste! We can take advantage of technology and use this to reduce paper waste. 
Further, listening to audiobooks can help improve your memory.
