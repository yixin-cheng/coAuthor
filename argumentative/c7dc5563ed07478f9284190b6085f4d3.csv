In my opinion, the term ""screens"" is unhelpful. Long before the social media age and the pandemic, people sat at home glued to TV screens for hour after hour.  There are three main purposes of looking at a screen, for information, social connection and entertainment. If we divide out screen time to embrace social media and education, we are putting them to good use. And as for entertainment, this come in large part via screens since relatively early in the twentieth century.
In my opinion, screen time is as beneficial as any other leisure activity.
 The mechanics and ergonomics of screen use are another issue. Hunching over a screen is unhealthy, as is long-term squinting at a screen and its attendant physical immobility. But these are practical, not moral issues. Improved AI,  AR and robotics are likely to progressively integrate the main functions of screen time with the physical world in a relatively healthy manner. 

In time, whole populations might live mostly in virtual environments without any significant increase in health problems. The benefits of physical exercise and fresh air will still apply, but exercise has been integrated with VR and gaming since the Nintendo Wi. 

Reality and entertainment will merge in the best possible ways. Do you agree? Write me @twit",1750,[],0,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1258

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?
