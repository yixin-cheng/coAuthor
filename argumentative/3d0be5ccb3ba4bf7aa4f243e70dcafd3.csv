In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them.

With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them.

With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them. 

People also disappoint us. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they hurt us. These are things that we realize from a young age. I feel that on a more instinctive nature that we're more likely to care about an animal being harmed than a human for those reasons.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them. 

People also disappoint us. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they hurt us. These are things that we realize from a young age. I feel that on a more instinctive nature that we're more likely to care about an animal being harmed than a human for those reasons.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them. 

People also disappoint us. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they hurt us. These are things that we realize from a young age. I feel that on a more instinctive nature that we're more likely to care about an animal being harmed than a human for those reasons. 

I feel probably that people who haven't had pets may be more likely to feel empathetic towards a human than an animal though. They may not realize how kind and loving animals can ",1620,[],4,4,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1081

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them. 

People also disappoint us. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they hurt us. These are things that we realize from a young age. I feel that on a more instinctive nature that we're more likely to care about an animal being harmed than a human for those reasons.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them. 

People also disappoint us. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they hurt us. These are things that we realize from a young age. I feel that on a more instinctive nature that we're more likely to care about an animal being harmed than a human for those reasons. 

I feel probably that people who haven't had pets may be more likely to feel empathetic towards a human than an animal though. They may not realize how kind and loving animals can be.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them. 

People also disappoint us. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they hurt us. These are things that we realize from a young age. I feel that on a more instinctive nature that we're more likely to care about an animal being harmed than a human for those reasons.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them.

They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them. 

People also disappoint us. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they hurt us. These are things that we realize from a young age. I feel that on a more instinctive nature that we're more likely to care about an animal being harmed than a human for those reasons. 

I feel probably that people who haven't had pets may be more likely to feel empathetic towards a human than an animal though. They may not realize how kind and loving animals can be. They may not realize that animals are just as capable of feeling pain and suffering as humans.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them. 

People also disappoint us. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they hurt us. These are things that we realize from a young age. I feel that on a more instinctive nature that we're more likely to care about an animal being harmed than a human for those reasons. 

I feel probably that people who haven't had pets may be more likely to feel empathetic towards a human than an animal though. They may not realize how kind and loving animals can be. They may not realize that animals are just as capable of feeling pain and suffering as humans.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them. 

People also disappoint us. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they hurt us. These are things that we realize from a young age. I feel that on a more instinctive nature that we're more likely to care about an animal being harmed than a human for those reasons. 

I feel probably that people who haven't had pets may be more likely to feel empathetic towards a human than an animal though. They may not realize how kind and loving animals can be. They may not realize that animals are just as capable of feeling pain and suffering as humans. That could be a factor in how people respond to whether they feel more sympathy for a person or an animals.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them. 

People also disappoint us. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they hurt us. These are things that we realize from a young age. I feel that on a more instinctive nature that we're more likely to care about an animal being harmed than a human for those reasons. 

I feel probably that people who haven't had pets may be more likely to feel empathetic towards a human than an animal though. They may not realize how kind and loving animals can be. They may not realize that animals are just as capable of feeling pain and suffering as humans. That could be a factor in how people respond to whether they feel more sympathy for a person or an animals.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them. 

People also disappoint us. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they hurt us. These are things that we realize from a young age. I feel that on a more instinctive nature that we're more likely to care about an animal being harmed than a human for those reasons. 

I feel probably that people who haven't had pets may be more likely to feel empathetic towards a human than an animal though. They may not realize how kind and loving animals can be. They may not realize that animals are just as capable of feeling pain and suffering as humans. That could be a factor in how people respond to whether they feel more sympathy for a person or an animals.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them. 

People also disappoint us. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they hurt us. These are things that we realize from a young age. I feel that on a more instinctive nature that we're more likely to care about an animal being harmed than a human for those reasons. 

I feel probably that people who haven't had pets may be more likely to feel empathetic towards a human than an animal though. They may not realize how kind and loving animals can be. They may not realize that animals are just as capable of feeling pain and suffering as humans.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them. 

People also disappoint us. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they hurt us. These are things that we realize from a young age. I feel that on a more instinctive nature that we're more likely to care about an animal being harmed than a human for those reasons. 

I feel probably that people who haven't had pets may be more likely to feel empathetic towards a human than an animal though. They may not realize how kind and loving animals can be.

They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them. 

People also disappoint us. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they hurt us. These are things that we realize from a young age. I feel that on a more instinctive nature that we're more likely to care about an animal being harmed than a human for those reasons. 

I feel probably that people who haven't had pets may be more likely to feel empathetic towards a human than an animal though. They may not realize how kind and loving animals can be. They may not realize that animals are just as capable of feeling pain and suffering as humans. That could be a factor in how people respond to whether they feel more sympathy for a person or an animals. 

In general I believe people respond to the innocence of animals which is why they may feel more sympathy for them. I'm one of ",1955,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1395

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them. 

People also disappoint us. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they hurt us. These are things that we realize from a young age. I feel that on a more instinctive nature that we're more likely to care about an animal being harmed than a human for those reasons. 

I feel probably that people who haven't had pets may be more likely to feel empathetic towards a human than an animal though. They may not realize how kind and loving animals can be. They may not realize that animals are just as capable of feeling pain and suffering as humans. That could be a factor in how people respond to whether they feel more sympathy for a person or an animals.

They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them. 

People also disappoint us. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they hurt us. These are things that we realize from a young age. I feel that on a more instinctive nature that we're more likely to care about an animal being harmed than a human for those reasons. 

I feel probably that people who haven't had pets may be more likely to feel empathetic towards a human than an animal though. They may not realize how kind and loving animals can be. They may not realize that animals are just as capable of feeling pain and suffering as humans. That could be a factor in how people respond to whether they feel more sympathy for a person or an animals. 

In general I believe people respond to the innocence of animals which is why they may feel more sympathy for them. I'm one of those people so I can relate. I",1986,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1426

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them. 

People also disappoint us. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they hurt us. These are things that we realize from a young age. I feel that on a more instinctive nature that we're more likely to care about an animal being harmed than a human for those reasons.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them. 

People also disappoint us. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they hurt us. These are things that we realize from a young age. I feel that on a more instinctive nature that we're more likely to care about an animal being harmed than a human for those reasons. 

I feel probably that people who haven't had pets may be more likely to feel empathetic towards a human than an animal though. They may not realize how kind and loving animals can be. They may not realize that animals are just as capable of feeling pain and suffering as humans.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them. 

People also disappoint us. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they hurt us. These are things that we realize from a young age. I feel that on a more instinctive nature that we're more likely to care about an animal being harmed than a human for those reasons. 

I feel probably that people who haven't had pets may be more likely to feel empathetic towards a human than an animal though. They may not realize how kind and loving animals can be. They may not realize that animals are just as capable of feeling pain and suffering as humans. That could be a factor in how people respond to whether they feel more sympathy for a person or an animals.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them. 

People also disappoint us. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they hurt us. These are things that we realize from a young age. I feel that on a more instinctive nature that we're more likely to care about an animal being harmed than a human for those reasons. 

I feel probably that people who haven't had pets may be more likely to feel empathetic towards a human than an animal though. They may not realize how kind and loving animals can be.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them. 

People also disappoint us. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they hurt us. These are things that we realize from a young age. I feel that on a more instinctive nature that we're more likely to care about an animal being harmed than a human for those reasons. 

I feel probably that people who haven't had pets may be more likely to feel empathetic towards a human than an animal though. They may not realize how kind and loving animals can be. They may not realize that animals are just as capable of feeling pain and suffering as humans. That could be a factor in how people respond to whether they feel more sympathy for a person or an animals. 

In general I believe people respond to the innocence of animals which is why they may feel more sympathy for them. I'm one of those people so I can relate. I wish more people would want to help animals as they need our help. I am happy though that there are people who cons",2102,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1546

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them. 

People also disappoint us. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they hurt us. These are things that we realize from a young age. I feel that on a more instinctive nature that we're more likely to care about an animal being harmed than a human for those reasons. 

I feel probably that people who haven't had pets may be more likely to feel empathetic towards a human than an animal though. They may not realize how kind and loving animals can be. They may not realize that animals are just as capable of feeling pain and suffering as humans. That could be a factor in how people respond to whether they feel more sympathy for a person or an animals. 

In general I believe people respond to the innocence of animals which is why they may feel more sympathy for them. I'm one of those people so I can relate. I wish more people would want to help animals as they need our help. I am happy though that there are people who consider them just as important a",2131,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1575
