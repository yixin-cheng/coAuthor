While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled.

Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I",1864,[],4,4,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,986

Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter.",1644,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1097

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter.

While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.

Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled.

Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter.

Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.

He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter.

Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them.

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking.

While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of o",2432,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1329

 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes with",2453,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1352

While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside.

 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by",2479,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1397

Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that poi",2488,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1408

He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside.

Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.

Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him.

Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands",2543,[],1,1,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1452

He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him",2554,[],1,1,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1463

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside.

Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. ",2575,[],1,1,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1485

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom.

Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. ",2680,[],1,1,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1506

Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. ",2736,[],1,1,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1516

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys.

 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. ",2849,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1526

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter.

I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. ",2849,[],0,2,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1536

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan.

Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. ",2897,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1546

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside.

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him.

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom.

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside.

While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom.

Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, bec",3053,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1669

I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more ",3086,[],0,2,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1706

Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs.

I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs.

I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom.

I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside.

We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter.

I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We're getting married in less than a month now and I can't wait! If it weren't for",3237,[],1,1,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1832

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan.

He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last.

Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We're getting married in less than a month now and I can't wait! If it weren't for Tinder, I never would have met Matt. An",3277,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1850

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs.

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary.

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We're getting married in less than a month now and I can't wait! If it weren't for Tinder, I never would have met Matt. And if I hadn't met Matt, I",3302,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1876

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs.

I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We're getting married in less than a month now and I can't wait! If it weren't for Tinder, I never would have met Matt.

I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We're getting married in less than a month now and I can't wait! If it weren't for Tinder, I never would have met Matt.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs.

He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We're getting married in less than a month now and I can't wait! If it weren't for Tinder, I never would have met Matt.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs.

While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We're getting married in less than a month now and I can't wait! If it weren't for Tinder, I never would have met Matt.

Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We're getting married in less than a month now and I can't wait! If it weren't for Tinder, I never would have met Matt.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We're getting married in less than a month now and I can't wait! If it weren't for Tinder, I never would have met Matt. And if I hadn't met Matt, I certainly wouldn't be having as much fun as I am now. So I am a firm believer that ",3386,[],0,2,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1970
