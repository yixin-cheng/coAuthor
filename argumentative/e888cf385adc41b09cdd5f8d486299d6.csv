In my opinion, the argument makes sense but there are other ways the players could get paid. They could get paid by the TV stations, promotional situations and maybe enjoy some extra non-monetary perks from Universities. As stated above, the TV networks make a killing off of these players and should at the very least help pay for higher education or other beneficial pursuits.

In my opinion, the argument makes sense but there are other ways the players could get paid. They could get paid by the TV stations, promotional situations and maybe enjoy some extra non-monetary perks from Universities. As stated above, the TV networks make a killing off of these players and should at the very least help pay for higher education or other beneficial pursuits. This would probably create an elite class of players even more then now but probably not by much. They are already highly regarded and respected players who are on TV all the time, some extra money or a car here and there would not make much of a difference. It may actually encourage some players to focus more on their game and get better. I imagine there would be a few down sides, like the poorer colleges not being able to secure decent players and then it would be a cycle of bad seasons and less money.

In my opinion, the argument makes sense but there are other ways the players could get paid. They could get paid by the TV stations, promotional situations and maybe enjoy some extra non-monetary perks from Universities. As stated above, the TV networks make a killing off of these players and should at the very least help pay for higher education or other beneficial pursuits.

They are already highly regarded and respected players who are on TV all the time, some extra money or a car here and there would not make much of a difference.

In my opinion, the argument makes sense but there are other ways the players could get paid. They could get paid by the TV stations, promotional situations and maybe enjoy some extra non-monetary perks from Universities. As stated above, the TV networks make a killing off of these players and should at the very least help pay for higher education or other beneficial pursuits. This would probably create an elite class of players even more then now but probably not by much. They are already highly regarded and respected players who are on TV all the time, some extra money or a car here and there would not make much of a difference. It may actually encourage some players to focus more on their game and get better. I imagine there would be a few down sides, like the poorer colleges not being able to secure decent players and then it would be a cycle of bad seasons and less money.

In my opinion, the argument makes sense but there are other ways the players could get paid. They could get paid by the TV stations, promotional situations and maybe enjoy some extra non-monetary perks from Universities. As stated above, the TV networks make a killing off of these players and should at the very least help pay for higher education or other beneficial pursuits. This would probably create an elite class of players even more then now but probably not by much. They are already highly regarded and respected players who are on TV all the time, some extra money or a car here and there would not make much of a difference.

In my opinion, the argument makes sense but there are other ways the players could get paid. They could get paid by the TV stations, promotional situations and maybe enjoy some extra non-monetary perks from Universities. As stated above, the TV networks make a killing off of these players and should at the very least help pay for higher education or other beneficial pursuits. This would probably create an elite class of players even more then now but probably not by much. They are already highly regarded and respected players who are on TV all the time, some extra money or a car here and there would not make much of a difference. It may actually encourage some players to focus more on their game and get better.

In my opinion, the argument makes sense but there are other ways the players could get paid. They could get paid by the TV stations, promotional situations and maybe enjoy some extra non-monetary perks from Universities. As stated above, the TV networks make a killing off of these players and should at the very least help pay for higher education or other beneficial pursuits. This would probably create an elite class of players even more then now but probably not by much. They are already highly regarded and respected players who are on TV all the time, some extra money or a car here and there would not make much of a difference. It may actually encourage some players to focus more on their game and get better. I imagine there would be a few down sides, like the poorer colleges not being able to secure decent players and then it would be a cycle of bad seasons and less money. The other down side would be the elite players getting paid more and then not being as hungry to win. More money may distract thoes top players.

In my opinion, the argument makes sense but there are other ways the players could get paid. They could get paid by the TV stations, promotional situations and maybe enjoy some extra non-monetary perks from Universities. As stated above, the TV networks make a killing off of these players and should at the very least help pay for higher education or other beneficial pursuits. This would probably create an elite class of players even more then now but probably not by much. They are already highly regarded and respected players who are on TV all the time, some extra money or a car here and there would not make much of a difference. It may actually encourage some players to focus more on their game and get better.

In my opinion, the argument makes sense but there are other ways the players could get paid. They could get paid by the TV stations, promotional situations and maybe enjoy some extra non-monetary perks from Universities. As stated above, the TV networks make a killing off of these players and should at the very least help pay for higher education or other beneficial pursuits. This would probably create an elite class of players even more then now but probably not by much. They are already highly regarded and respected players who are on TV all the time, some extra money or a car here and there would not make much of a difference. It may actually encourage some players to focus more on their game and get better.
