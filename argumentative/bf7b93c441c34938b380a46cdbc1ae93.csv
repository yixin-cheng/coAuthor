Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, we should ban risky sports like mountain climbing to be called a sports. I'm sure a lot of you disagree, but I think it's too dangerous. Remember the time when gladiators have had to fight to the death? It sure felt like sport at the time, but we as a society have evolved and we have realized that it's not a sport. It's a barbaric act. And I know a lot of enthusiast and ""athletes"" of extreme sports will disagree with me, but I think it's just as barbaric.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it. Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

In my opinion, we should ban risky sports like mountain climbing to be called a sports. I'm sure a lot of you disagree, but I think it's too dangerous.

In my opinion, we should ban risky sports like mountain climbing to be called a sports. I'm sure a lot of you disagree, but I think it's too dangerous. Remember the time when gladiators have had to fight to the death? It sure felt like sport at the time, but we as a society have evolved and we have realized that it's not a sport. It's a barbaric act. And I know a lot of enthusiast and ""athletes"" of extreme sports will disagree with me, but I think it's just as barbaric.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it. Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Yet, thousands or even millions of people are willing to risk their lives just to get a thrill. It's something that we as a society have to stop. So",1905,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1259

Remember the time when gladiators have had to fight to the death? It sure felt like sport at the time, but we as a society have evolved and we have realized that it's not a sport. It's a barbaric act. And I know a lot of enthusiast and ""athletes"" of extreme sports will disagree with me, but I think it's just as barbaric.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it. Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it.

Remember the time when gladiators have had to fight to the death? It sure felt like sport at the time, but we as a society have evolved and we have realized that it's not a sport. It's a barbaric act. And I know a lot of enthusiast and ""athletes"" of extreme sports will disagree with me, but I think it's just as barbaric.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it. Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Yet, thousands or even millions of people are willing to risk their lives just to get a thrill. It's something that we as a society have to stop. There are very safe alternatives such ",1941,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1349

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, we should ban risky sports like mountain climbing to be called a sports. I'm sure a lot of you disagree, but I think it's too dangerous. Remember the time when gladiators have had to fight to the death? It sure felt like sport at the time, but we as a society have evolved and we have realized that it's not a sport. It's a barbaric act. And I know a lot of enthusiast and ""athletes"" of extreme sports will disagree with me, but I think it's just as barbaric.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it. Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Yet, thousands or even millions of people are willing to risk their lives just to get a thrill. It's something that we as a society have to stop.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it. Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Yet, thousands or even millions of people are willing to risk their lives just to get a thrill. It's something that we as a society have to stop.

There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, we should ban risky sports like mountain climbing to be called a sports. I'm sure a lot of you disagree, but I think it's too dangerous. Remember the time when gladiators have had to fight to the death? It sure felt like sport at the time, but we as a society have evolved and we have realized that it's not a sport. It's a barbaric act. And I know a lot of enthusiast and ""athletes"" of extreme sports will disagree with me, but I think it's just as barbaric.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it. Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Yet, thousands or even millions of people are willing to risk their lives just to get a thrill. It's something that we as a society have to stop. There are very safe alternatives such as esports, where you can get the thrill of competition without risking your life. The esports industry is thriving.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, we should ban risky sports like mountain climbing to be called a sports. I'm sure a lot of you disagree, but I think it's too dangerous. Remember the time when gladiators have had to fight to the death? It sure felt like sport at the time, but we as a society have evolved and we have realized that it's not a sport. It's a barbaric act. And I know a lot of enthusiast and ""athletes"" of extreme sports will disagree with me, but I think it's just as barbaric.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it. Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Yet, thousands or even millions of people are willing to risk their lives just to get a thrill. It's something that we as a society have to stop. There are very safe alternatives such as esports, where you can get the thrill of competition without risking your life. The esports industry is thriving. Last 2019, esports earnings have gone up to $696 million, and it's expected to reach $1.5 billion by 2020.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, we should ban risky sports like mountain climbing to be called a sports. I'm sure a lot of you disagree, but I think it's too dangerous.

In my opinion, we should ban risky sports like mountain climbing to be called a sports. I'm sure a lot of you disagree, but I think it's too dangerous.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, we should ban risky sports like mountain climbing to be called a sports. I'm sure a lot of you disagree, but I think it's too dangerous.

Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, we should ban risky sports like mountain climbing to be called a sports. I'm sure a lot of you disagree, but I think it's too dangerous.

There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Yet, thousands or even millions of people are willing to risk their lives just to get a thrill. It's something that we as a society have to stop. There are very safe alternatives such as esports, where you can get the thrill of competition without risking your life. The esports industry is thriving. Last 2019, esports earnings have gone up to $696 million, and it's expected to reach $1.5 billion by 2020.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, we should ban risky sports like mountain climbing to be called a sports. I'm sure a lot of you disagree, but I think it's too dangerous.

Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, we should ban risky sports like mountain climbing to be called a sports. I'm sure a lot of you disagree, but I think it's too dangerous. Remember the time when gladiators have had to fight to the death? It sure felt like sport at the time, but we as a society have evolved and we have realized that it's not a sport. It's a barbaric act. And I know a lot of enthusiast and ""athletes"" of extreme sports will disagree with me, but I think it's just as barbaric.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it. Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Yet, thousands or even millions of people are willing to risk their lives just to get a thrill. It's something that we as a society have to stop. There are very safe alternatives such as esports, where you can get the thrill of competition without risking your life. The esports industry is thriving. Last 2019, esports earnings have gone up to $696 million, and it's expected to reach $1.5 billion by 2020.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it. Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Yet, thousands or even millions of people are willing to risk their lives just to get a thrill. It's something that we as a society have to stop. There are very safe alternatives such as esports, where you can get the thrill of competition without risking your life. The esports industry is thriving. Last 2019, esports earnings have gone up to $696 million, and it's expected to reach $1.5 billion by 2020.
