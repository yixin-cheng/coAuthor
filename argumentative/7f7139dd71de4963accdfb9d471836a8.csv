In my opinion, schools should provide free pads and tampons to students. It's a basic medical need. For girls of a certain age, they may be at school when they get their first period. Pads or tampons would be needed to address the issue at that time.

Not every student can afford to purchase such products. I think that if a student is in need, they should be able to get them from the school. It's similar to students who get free breakfast.
