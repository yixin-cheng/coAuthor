The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world.

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner.

I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm alway",2326,[],3,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,655

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. ",2447,[],0,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,681

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions.

For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions.

And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing.

 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions.

Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions.

Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my ",3204,[],0,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,800

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions.

Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter",3212,[],0,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,810

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions.

Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper th",3222,[],0,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,820

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that ",3225,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,830

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing.

For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens.

Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more th",3466,[],3,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,858

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Fa",3476,[],3,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,868

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?

It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook.

For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. Tha",3610,[],4,4,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,904

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why o",3619,[],4,4,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,913

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline.

For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our fa",3624,[],4,4,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,922

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?

I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have ha",3644,[],0,4,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,948

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing.

She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limi",3651,[],0,4,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,957

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.

For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet.

At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still",3682,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,984

Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still ",3683,[],4,4,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,992

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions.

For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. An",3762,[],4,4,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1001

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance.

My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we",3779,[],4,4,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1018

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people.

At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always ",3787,[],3,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1035

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions.

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftent",3879,[],3,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1044

My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we",3887,[],3,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1052

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us.

 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions.

Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world.

Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing.

 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens.

It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook.

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?

Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us. Everly loves grilling with her dad, because it's a shared family-time experience. And Bryson just enjoys eating the boneless buffalo wings I make for him, which are as big as his head.

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing.

 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us.

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us. Everly loves grilling with her dad, because it's a shared family-time experience. And Bryson just enjoys eating the boneless buffalo wings I make for him, which are as big as his head.

I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us. Everly loves grilling with her dad, because it's a shared family-time experience. And Bryson just enjoys eating the boneless buffalo wings I make for him, which are as big as his head.

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing.

Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us. Everly loves grilling with her dad, because it's a shared family-time experience. And Bryson just enjoys eating the boneless buffalo wings I make for him, which are as big as his head. So there's the balance I was talking abou--social time with family, physical recreation, even a little bit of time spent cooking.",4165,[],4,4,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1196

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world.

Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist.

At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us. Everly loves grilling with her dad, because it's a shared family-time experience. And Bryson just enjoys eating the boneless buffalo wings I make for him, which are as big as his head.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us.

She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us. Everly loves grilling with her dad, because it's a shared family-time experience. And Bryson just enjoys eating the boneless buffalo wings I make for him, which are as big as his head. So there's the balance I was talking about earlier--social time with family, physical recreation, even a little bit of time spent cooking.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.

For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us. Everly loves grilling with her dad, because it's a shared family-time experience. And Bryson just enjoys eating the boneless buffalo wings I make for him, which are as big as his head. So there's the balance I was talking about earlier--social time with family, physical recreation, even a little bit of time spent cooking.

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing.

 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us. Everly loves grilling with her dad, because it's a shared family-time experience. And Bryson just enjoys eating the boneless buffalo wings I make for him, which are as big as his head. So there's the balance I was talking about earlier--social time with family, physical recreation, even a little bit of time spent cooking.

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions.

Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us. Everly loves grilling with her dad, because it's a shared family-time experience. And Bryson just enjoys eating the boneless buffalo wings I make for him, which are as big as his head. So there's the balance I was talking about earlier--social time with family, physical recreation, even a little bit of time spent cooking.

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?

This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us. Everly loves grilling with her dad, because it's a shared family-time experience. And Bryson just enjoys eating the boneless buffalo wings I make for him, which are as big as his head. So there's the balance I was talking about earlier--social time with family, physical recreation, even a little bit of time spent cooking.

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us. Everly loves grilling with her dad, because it's a shared family-time experience. And Bryson just enjoys eating the boneless buffalo wings I make for him, which are as big as his head.

 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us. Everly loves grilling with her dad, because it's a shared family-time experience. And Bryson just enjoys eating the boneless buffalo wings I make for him, which are as big as his head. So there's the balance I was talking about earlier--social time with family, physical recreation, even a little bit of time spent cooking.

In conclusion, I don't think we need to be too concerned about screen ",4334,[],4,4,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1280

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions.

I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us. Everly loves grilling with her dad, because it's a shared family-time experience. And Bryson just enjoys eating the boneless buffalo wings I make for him, which are as big as his head. So there's the balance I was talking about earlier--social time with family, physical recreation, even a little bit of time spent cooking.

That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us. Everly loves grilling with her dad, because it's a shared family-time experience. And Bryson just enjoys eating the boneless buffalo wings I make for him, which are as big as his head.

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing.

For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us. Everly loves grilling with her dad, because it's a shared family-time experience. And Bryson just enjoys eating the boneless buffalo wings I make for him, which are as big as his head. So there's the balance I was talking about earlier--social time with family, physical recreation, even a little bit of time spent cooking.

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing.

For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us. Everly loves grilling with her dad, because it's a shared family-time experience. And Bryson just enjoys eating the boneless buffalo wings I make for him, which are as big as his head. So there's the balance I was talking about earlier--social time with family, physical recreation, even a little bit of time spent cooking.

In conclusion, I don't think we need to be too concerned about screen time, as long as we're using it in mod",4372,[],4,4,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1318

Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us. Everly loves grilling with her dad, because it's a shared family-time experience. And Bryson just enjoys eating the boneless buffalo wings I make for him, which are as big as his head. So there's the balance I was talking about earlier--social time with family, physical recreation, even a little bit of time spent cooking.

In conclusion, I don't think we need to be too concerned about screen time, as long as we're using it in moderation",4379,[],4,4,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1325

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
