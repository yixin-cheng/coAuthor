The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps.

Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating.

It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating.

You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to.

Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating.

It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater",2084,[],4,4,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1052

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating.

It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequen",2163,[],4,4,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1139

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead.

It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead.

The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

Texting, compared to prior methods of communicating, is superior in its speed and lack of pronouns. It's quicker than a call, and it avoids the problem of people being on different schedules and talking at different times.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

Texting, compared to prior methods of communicating, is superior in its speed and lack of pronouns. It's quicker than a call, and it avoids the problem of people being on different schedules and talking at different times. It is somewhat limited in what it can communicate, but in many cases, that's a plus, ",2583,[],2,2,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1332

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

Texting, compared to prior methods of communicating, is superior in its speed and lack of pronouns. It's quicker than a call, and it avoids the problem of people being on different schedules and talking at different times.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

Texting, compared to prior methods of communicating, is superior in its speed and lack of pronouns. It's quicker than a call, and it avoids the problem of people being on different schedules and talking at different times. It is somewhat limited in what it can communicate, but in many cases, that's a plus, because it reduces arguments about what's being said and read into.

Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

Texting, compared to prior methods of communicating, is superior in its speed and lack of pronouns. It's quicker than a call, and it avoids the problem of people being on different schedules and talking at different times. It is somewhat limited in what it can communicate, but in many cases, that's a plus, because it reduces arguments about what's being said and read into. On the whole, it's made staying in touch with partners much easier and more enjoyable.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

Texting, compared to prior methods of communicating, is superior in its speed and lack of pronouns. It's quicker than a call, and it avoids the problem of people being on different schedules and talking at different times. It is somewhat limited in what it can communicate, but in many cases, that's a plus, because it reduces arguments about what's being said and read into. On the whole, it's made staying in touch with partners much easier and more enjoyable.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

Texting, compared to prior methods of communicating, is superior in its speed and lack of pronouns. It's quicker than a call, and it avoids the problem of people being on different schedules and talking at different times. It is somewhat limited in what it can communicate, but in many cases, that's a plus, because it reduces arguments about what's being said and read into. On the whole, it's made staying in touch with partners much easier and more enjoyable.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

Texting, compared to prior methods of communicating, is superior in its speed and lack of pronouns. It's quicker than a call, and it avoids the problem of people being on different schedules and talking at different times. It is somewhat limited in what it can communicate, but in many cases, that's a plus, because it reduces arguments about what's being said and read into. On the whole, it's made staying in touch with partners much easier and more enjoyable.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

Texting, compared to prior methods of communicating, is superior in its speed and lack of pronouns. It's quicker than a call, and it avoids the problem of people being on different schedules and talking at different times. It is somewhat limited in what it can communicate, but in many cases, that's a plus, because it reduces arguments about what's being said and read into. On the whole, it's made staying in touch with partners much easier and more enjoyable.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

Texting, compared to prior methods of communicating, is superior in its speed and lack of pronouns. It's quicker than a call, and it avoids the problem of people being on different schedules and talking at different times. It is somewhat limited in what it can communicate, but in many cases, that's a plus, because it reduces arguments about what's being said and read into. On the whole, it's made staying in touch with partners much easier and more enjoyable.

Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

Texting, compared to prior methods of communicating, is superior in its speed and lack of pronouns. It's quicker than a call, and it avoids the problem of people being on different schedules and talking at different times. It is somewhat limited in what it can communicate, but in many cases, that's a plus, because it reduces arguments about what's being said and read into. On the whole, it's made staying in touch with partners much easier and more enjoyable.

You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

Texting, compared to prior methods of communicating, is superior in its speed and lack of pronouns.

The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

Texting, compared to prior methods of communicating, is superior in its speed and lack of pronouns. It's quicker than a call, and it avoids the problem of people being on different schedules and talking at different times. It is somewhat limited in what it can communicate, but in many cases, that's a plus, because it reduces arguments about what's being said and read into.

The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

Texting, compared to prior methods of communicating, is superior in its speed and lack of pronouns. It's quicker than a call, and it avoids the problem of people being on different schedules and talking at different times. It is somewhat limited in what it can communicate, but in many cases, that's a plus, because it reduces arguments about what's being said and read into. On the whole, it's made staying in touch with partners much easier and more enjoyable.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

Texting, compared to prior methods of communicating, is superior in its speed and lack of pronouns. It's quicker than a call, and it avoids the problem of people being on different schedules and talking at different times. It is somewhat limited in what it can communicate, but in many cases, that's a plus, because it reduces arguments about what's being said and read into. On the whole, it's made staying in touch with partners much easier and more enjoyable.

And that's kind of my take on all the 21st century innovations in dating. They haven't fundamentally changed the things that you need to do to establish and maintain a relationship, bu",2923,[],3,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1615

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

Texting, compared to prior methods of communicating, is superior in its speed and lack of pronouns. It's quicker than a call, and it avoids the problem of people being on different schedules and talking at different times. It is somewhat limited in what it can communicate, but in many cases, that's a plus, because it reduces arguments about what's being said and read into. On the whole, it's made staying in touch with partners much easier and more enjoyable.

Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to.

It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

Texting, compared to prior methods of communicating, is superior in its speed and lack of pronouns. It's quicker than a call, and it avoids the problem of people being on different schedules and talking at different times. It is somewhat limited in what it can communicate, but in many cases, that's a plus, because it reduces arguments about what's being said and read into. On the whole, it's made staying in touch with partners much easier and more enjoyable.

And that's kind of my take on all the 21st century innovations in dating. They haven't fundamentally changed the things that you need to do to establish and maintain a relationship, but they have made doing all those things easier.",2949,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1647

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

Texting, compared to prior methods of communicating, is superior in its speed and lack of pronouns. It's quicker than a call, and it avoids the problem of people being on different schedules and talking at different times. It is somewhat limited in what it can communicate, but in many cases, that's a plus, because it reduces arguments about what's being said and read into. On the whole, it's made staying in touch with partners much easier and more enjoyable.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater.

You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

Texting, compared to prior methods of communicating, is superior in its speed and lack of pronouns. It's quicker than a call, and it avoids the problem of people being on different schedules and talking at different times. It is somewhat limited in what it can communicate, but in many cases, that's a plus, because it reduces arguments about what's being said and read into. On the whole, it's made staying in touch with partners much easier and more enjoyable.

And that's kind of my take on all the 21st century innovations in dating. They haven't fundamentally changed the things that you need to do to establish and maintain a relationship, but they have made doing all of those things easier and more convenient. S",2995,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1679

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

Texting, compared to prior methods of communicating, is superior in its speed and lack of pronouns. It's quicker than a call, and it avoids the problem of people being on different schedules and talking at different times. It is somewhat limited in what it can communicate, but in many cases, that's a plus, because it reduces arguments about what's being said and read into. On the whole, it's made staying in touch with partners much easier and more enjoyable.

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.
