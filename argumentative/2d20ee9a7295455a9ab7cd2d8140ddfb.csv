I would definitely not watch or read something due to offensive stereotypes.  Especially, when the negative stereotype is about race.   There are old movies where actors pretend to be African-American or Asian.     The portrayal was not funny, realistic or funny at all.  For me, it takes away from the story of the movies and shows when this occurs.  It is hard for me to focus on the media due to the ridiculous, stereotypical portrayals by the the actors in the movie.

One offensive portray to me is when the actor Mickey Rooney played an Asian character in Breakfast at Tiffanys.   Mickey Rooney costume looked horrible.  His manners were bad.  It just takes me out of the movie.   It makes me wonder about the actors in the movie and their thoughts behind playing such a racial role in a prominent movie.  I understand that Breakfast at Tiffanys came out during the 1980s and people got away with a bit more back then.

It is hard for me to focus on the media due to the ridiculous, stereotypical portrayals by the the actors in the movie.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

I would definitely not watch or read something due to offensive stereotypes.  Especially, when the negative stereotype is about race.   There are old movies where actors pretend to be African-American or Asian.     The portrayal was not funny, realistic or funny at all.  For me, it takes away from the story of the movies and shows when this occurs.  It is hard for me to focus on the media due to the ridiculous, stereotypical portrayals by the the actors in the movie.

One offensive portray to me is when the actor Mickey Rooney played an Asian character in Breakfast at Tiffanys.   Mickey Rooney costume looked horrible.  His manners were bad.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

I would definitely not watch or read something due to offensive stereotypes.  Especially, when the negative stereotype is about race.   There are old movies where actors pretend to be African-American or Asian.     The portrayal was not funny, realistic or funny at all.  For me, it takes away from the story of the movies and shows when this occurs.  It is hard for me to focus on the media due to the ridiculous, stereotypical portrayals by the the actors in the movie.

One offensive portray to me is when the actor Mickey Rooney played an Asian character in Breakfast at Tiffanys.   Mickey Rooney costume looked horrible.  His manners were bad.  It just takes me out of the movie.   It makes me wonder about the actors in the movie and their thoughts behind playing such a racial role in a prominent movie.  I understand that Breakfast at Tiffanys came out during the 1980s and people got away with a bit more back then.  

Ultimately, when I see the lazy, negative stereotypes in the media, the overall quality of the film is often not great.  I know when I see stereotypical characters that it is often a reflection of bad writing overall.  I know I probably won't enjoy the movie when I encounter stereotypical characters.  In the end, stereotypical characters do not add to the story, nor does it add humor or creativity.

I would definitely not watch or read something due to offensive stereotypes.  Especially, when the negative stereotype is about race.   There are old movies where actors pretend to be African-American or Asian.     The portrayal was not funny, realistic or funny at all.  For me, it takes away from the story of the movies and shows when this occurs.  It is hard for me to focus on the media due to the ridiculous, stereotypical portrayals by the the actors in the movie.

One offensive portray to me is when the actor Mickey Rooney played an Asian character in Breakfast at Tiffanys.   Mickey Rooney costume looked horrible.  His manners were bad.  It just takes me out of the movie.   It makes me wonder about the actors in the movie and their thoughts behind playing such a racial role in a prominent movie.  I understand that Breakfast at Tiffanys came out during the 1980s and people got away with a bit more back then.  

Ultimately, when I see the lazy, negative stereotypes in the media, the overall quality of the film is often not great.  I know when I see stereotypical characters that it is often a reflection of bad writing overall.  I know I probably won't enjoy the movie when I encounter stereotypical characters.  In the end, stereotypical characters do not add to the story, nor does it add humor or creativity.

There are old movies where actors pretend to be African-American or Asian.     The portrayal was not funny, realistic or funny at all.  For me, it takes away from the story of the movies and shows when this occurs.  It is hard for me to focus on the media due to the ridiculous, stereotypical portrayals by the the actors in the movie.

One offensive portray to me is when the actor Mickey Rooney played an Asian character in Breakfast at Tiffanys.   Mickey Rooney costume looked horrible.  His manners were bad.  It just takes me out of the movie.   It makes me wonder about the actors in the movie and their thoughts behind playing such a racial role in a prominent movie.  I understand that Breakfast at Tiffanys came out during the 1980s and people got away with a bit more back then.  

Ultimately, when I see the lazy, negative stereotypes in the media, the overall quality of the film is often not great.  I know when I see stereotypical characters that it is often a reflection of bad writing overall.  I know I probably won't enjoy the movie when I encounter stereotypical characters.  In the end, stereotypical characters do not add to the story, nor does it add humor or creativity.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

I would definitely not watch or read something due to offensive stereotypes.  Especially, when the negative stereotype is about race.   There are old movies where actors pretend to be African-American or Asian.     The portrayal was not funny, realistic or funny at all.  For me, it takes away from the story of the movies and shows when this occurs.  It is hard for me to focus on the media due to the ridiculous, stereotypical portrayals by the the actors in the movie.

One offensive portray to me is when the actor Mickey Rooney played an Asian character in Breakfast at Tiffanys.   Mickey Rooney costume looked horrible.  His manners were bad.  It just takes me out of the movie.   It makes me wonder about the actors in the movie and their thoughts behind playing such a racial role in a prominent movie.  I understand that Breakfast at Tiffanys came out during the 1980s and people got away with a bit more back then.  

Ultimately, when I see the lazy, negative stereotypes in the media, the overall quality of the film is often not great.  I know when I see stereotypical characters that it is often a reflection of bad writing overall.  I know I probably won't enjoy the movie when I encounter stereotypical characters.

I would definitely not watch or read something due to offensive stereotypes.  Especially, when the negative stereotype is about race.   There are old movies where actors pretend to be African-American or Asian.     The portrayal was not funny, realistic or funny at all.  For me, it takes away from the story of the movies and shows when this occurs.  It is hard for me to focus on the media due to the ridiculous, stereotypical portrayals by the the actors in the movie.

One offensive portray to me is when the actor Mickey Rooney played an Asian character in Breakfast at Tiffanys.   Mickey Rooney costume looked horrible.  His manners were bad.  It just takes me out of the movie.   It makes me wonder about the actors in the movie and their thoughts behind playing such a racial role in a prominent movie.  I understand that Breakfast at Tiffanys came out during the 1980s and people got away with a bit more back then.  

Ultimately, when I see the lazy, negative stereotypes in the media, the overall quality of the film is often not great.  I know when I see stereotypical characters that it is often a reflection of bad writing overall.  I know I probably won't enjoy the movie when I encounter stereotypical characters.  In the end, stereotypical characters do not add to the story, nor does it add humor or creativity.

I would definitely not watch or read something due to offensive stereotypes.  Especially, when the negative stereotype is about race.   There are old movies where actors pretend to be African-American or Asian.     The portrayal was not funny, realistic or funny at all.  For me, it takes away from the story of the movies and shows when this occurs.  It is hard for me to focus on the media due to the ridiculous, stereotypical portrayals by the the actors in the movie.

One offensive portray to me is when the actor Mickey Rooney played an Asian character in Breakfast at Tiffanys.   Mickey Rooney costume looked horrible.  His manners were bad.  It just takes me out of the movie.   It makes me wonder about the actors in the movie and their thoughts behind playing such a racial role in a prominent movie.  I understand that Breakfast at Tiffanys came out during the 1980s and people got away with a bit more back then.  

Ultimately, when I see the lazy, negative stereotypes in the media, the overall quality of the film is often not great.  I know when I see stereotypical characters that it is often a reflection of bad writing overall.  I know I probably won't enjoy the movie when I encounter stereotypical characters.  In the end, stereotypical characters do not add to the story, nor does it add humor or creativity.

I would definitely not watch or read something due to offensive stereotypes.  Especially, when the negative stereotype is about race.   There are old movies where actors pretend to be African-American or Asian.     The portrayal was not funny, realistic or funny at all.  For me, it takes away from the story of the movies and shows when this occurs.  It is hard for me to focus on the media due to the ridiculous, stereotypical portrayals by the the actors in the movie.

One offensive portray to me is when the actor Mickey Rooney played an Asian character in Breakfast at Tiffanys.   Mickey Rooney costume looked horrible.  His manners were bad.  It just takes me out of the movie.   It makes me wonder about the actors in the movie and their thoughts behind playing such a racial role in a prominent movie.  I understand that Breakfast at Tiffanys came out during the 1980s and people got away with a bit more back then.  

Ultimately, when I see the lazy, negative stereotypes in the media, the overall quality of the film is often not great.  I know when I see stereotypical characters that it is often a reflection of bad writing overall.  I know I probably won't enjoy the movie when I encounter stereotypical characters.  In the end, stereotypical characters do not add to the story, nor does it add humor or creativity.
