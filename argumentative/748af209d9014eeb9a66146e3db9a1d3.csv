In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life. Younger people who are single and have no children may be willing to take on a greater level of risk than another person who is older and more established.However, I know some very good athletes in their 50s and 60s who are still climbing in places like Yosemite and the Coast Range.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life. Younger people who are single and have no children may be willing to take on a greater level of risk than another person who is older and more established.However, I know some very good athletes in their 50s and 60s who are still climbing in places like Yosemite and the Coast Range.
 They decided for themselves that being more active is a risk they are willing to take. 

I feel that younger people are less likely to be judged as selfish for pursuing there more dangerous activities. When you get out of your mid-20s and reach your 30s and beyond, you start to get some looks. However, people who are teenaged to 20 something tend to be able to do whatever without any issues. They could play dangerous sports, participate in Nascar or anything in between. 
It also depends on where you live.
 If you are doing an extreme sport that is not common in your area then people will be more likely to judge you. But if you are doing one that is very common then that is the norm of where you live. It just goes to show the extent of how many variables play into this argument.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life. Younger people who are single and have no children may be willing to take on a greater level of risk than another person who is older and more established.However, I know some very good athletes in their 50s and 60s who are still climbing in places like Yosemite and the Coast Range.
 They decided for themselves that being more active is a risk they are willing to take. 

I feel that younger people are less likely to be judged as selfish for pursuing there more dangerous activities. When you get out of your mid-20s and reach your 30s and beyond, you start to get some looks. However, people who are teenaged to 20 something tend to be able to do whatever without any issues. They could play dangerous sports, participate in Nascar or anything in between.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life.

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life. Younger people who are single and have no children may be willing to take on a greater level of risk than another person who is older and more established.However, I know some very good athletes in their 50s and 60s who are still climbing in places like Yosemite and the Coast Range.

They could play dangerous sports, participate in Nascar or anything in between. 
It also depends on where you live.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life. Younger people who are single and have no children may be willing to take on a greater level of risk than another person who is older and more established.However, I know some very good athletes in their 50s and 60s who are still climbing in places like Yosemite and the Coast Range.

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life. Younger people who are single and have no children may be willing to take on a greater level of risk than another person who is older and more established.However, I know some very good athletes in their 50s and 60s who are still climbing in places like Yosemite and the Coast Range.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life. Younger people who are single and have no children may be willing to take on a greater level of risk than another person who is older and more established.However, I know some very good athletes in their 50s and 60s who are still climbing in places like Yosemite and the Coast Range.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life. Younger people who are single and have no children may be willing to take on a greater level of risk than another person who is older and more established.However, I know some very good athletes in their 50s and 60s who are still climbing in places like Yosemite and the Coast Range.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life. Younger people who are single and have no children may be willing to take on a greater level of risk than another person who is older and more established.However, I know some very good athletes in their 50s and 60s who are still climbing in places like Yosemite and the Coast Range.
 They decided for themselves that being more active is a risk they are willing to take. 

I feel that younger people are less likely to be judged as selfish for pursuing there more dangerous activities. When you get out of your mid-20s and reach your 30s and beyond, you start to get some looks. However, people who are teenaged to 20 something tend to be able to do whatever without any issues. They could play dangerous sports, participate in Nascar or anything in between. 
It also depends on where you live.
 If you are doing an extreme sport that is not common in your area then people will be more likely to judge you. But if you are doing one that is very common then that is the norm of where you live.

Younger people who are single and have no children may be willing to take on a greater level of risk than another person who is older and more established.However, I know some very good athletes in their 50s and 60s who are still climbing in places like Yosemite and the Coast Range.
 They decided for themselves that being more active is a risk they are willing to take. 

I feel that younger people are less likely to be judged as selfish for pursuing there more dangerous activities. When you get out of your mid-20s and reach your 30s and beyond, you start to get some looks. However, people who are teenaged to 20 something tend to be able to do whatever without any issues. They could play dangerous sports, participate in Nascar or anything in between. 
It also depends on where you live.
 If you are doing an extreme sport that is not common in your area then people will be more likely to judge you. But if you are doing one that is very common then that is the norm of where you live.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life.

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life. Younger people who are single and have no children may be willing to take on a greater level of risk than another person who is older and more established.However, I know some very good athletes in their 50s and 60s who are still climbing in places like Yosemite and the Coast Range.
 They decided for themselves that being more active is a risk they are willing to take. 

I feel that younger people are less likely to be judged as selfish for pursuing there more dangerous activities. When you get out of your mid-20s and reach your 30s and beyond, you start to get some looks. However, people who are teenaged to 20 something tend to be able to do whatever without any issues. They could play dangerous sports, participate in Nascar or anything in between. 
It also depends on where you live.
 If you are doing an extreme sport that is not common in your area then people will be more likely to judge you. But if you are doing one that is very common then that is the norm of where you live. It just goes to show the extent of how many variables play into this argument. erception is everything when it comes to being labeled as selfish for our pursuits.
 It really comes down to what is considered acceptable on a society level as well as a local level.

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life. Younger people who are single and have no children may be willing to take on a greater level of risk than another person who is older and more established.However, I know some very good athletes in their 50s and 60s who are still climbing in places like Yosemite and the Coast Range.

When you get out of your mid-20s and reach your 30s and beyond, you start to get some looks. However, people who are teenaged to 20 something tend to be able to do whatever without any issues.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life. Younger people who are single and have no children may be willing to take on a greater level of risk than another person who is older and more established.However, I know some very good athletes in their 50s and 60s who are still climbing in places like Yosemite and the Coast Range.
 They decided for themselves that being more active is a risk they are willing to take. 

I feel that younger people are less likely to be judged as selfish for pursuing there more dangerous activities. When you get out of your mid-20s and reach your 30s and beyond, you start to get some looks. However, people who are teenaged to 20 something tend to be able to do whatever without any issues. They could play dangerous sports, participate in Nascar or anything in between. 
It also depends on where you live.
 If you are doing an extreme sport that is not common in your area then people will be more likely to judge you. But if you are doing one that is very common then that is the norm of where you live.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life. Younger people who are single and have no children may be willing to take on a greater level of risk than another person who is older and more established.However, I know some very good athletes in their 50s and 60s who are still climbing in places like Yosemite and the Coast Range.
 They decided for themselves that being more active is a risk they are willing to take. 

I feel that younger people are less likely to be judged as selfish for pursuing there more dangerous activities. When you get out of your mid-20s and reach your 30s and beyond, you start to get some looks. However, people who are teenaged to 20 something tend to be able to do whatever without any issues. They could play dangerous sports, participate in Nascar or anything in between. 
It also depends on where you live.
 If you are doing an extreme sport that is not common in your area then people will be more likely to judge you. But if you are doing one that is very common then that is the norm of where you live. It just goes to show the extent of how many variables play into this argument. erception is everything when it comes to being labeled as selfish for our pursuits.
 It really comes down to what is considered acceptable on a society level as well as a local level. 

So it it selfish to participate in extreme sports? I would have to say not necessarily. There are too many factors that can come into play to be able to say what is or is not selfish. ",1998,[],0,2,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1382

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life. Younger people who are single and have no children may be willing to take on a greater level of risk than another person who is older and more established.However, I know some very good athletes in their 50s and 60s who are still climbing in places like Yosemite and the Coast Range.

I feel that younger people are less likely to be judged as selfish for pursuing there more dangerous activities. When you get out of your mid-20s and reach your 30s and beyond, you start to get some looks. However, people who are teenaged to 20 something tend to be able to do whatever without any issues.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life. Younger people who are single and have no children may be willing to take on a greater level of risk than another person who is older and more established.However, I know some very good athletes in their 50s and 60s who are still climbing in places like Yosemite and the Coast Range.
 They decided for themselves that being more active is a risk they are willing to take. 

I feel that younger people are less likely to be judged as selfish for pursuing there more dangerous activities. When you get out of your mid-20s and reach your 30s and beyond, you start to get some looks. However, people who are teenaged to 20 something tend to be able to do whatever without any issues. They could play dangerous sports, participate in Nascar or anything in between. 
It also depends on where you live.
 If you are doing an extreme sport that is not common in your area then people will be more likely to judge you. But if you are doing one that is very common then that is the norm of where you live.

 It really comes down to what is considered acceptable on a society level as well as a local level.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life. Younger people who are single and have no children may be willing to take on a greater level of risk than another person who is older and more established.However, I know some very good athletes in their 50s and 60s who are still climbing in places like Yosemite and the Coast Range.
 They decided for themselves that being more active is a risk they are willing to take. 

I feel that younger people are less likely to be judged as selfish for pursuing there more dangerous activities. When you get out of your mid-20s and reach your 30s and beyond, you start to get some looks. However, people who are teenaged to 20 something tend to be able to do whatever without any issues. They could play dangerous sports, participate in Nascar or anything in between. 
It also depends on where you live.
 If you are doing an extreme sport that is not common in your area then people will be more likely to judge you. But if you are doing one that is very common then that is the norm of where you live. It just goes to show the extent of how many variables play into this argument. erception is everything when it comes to being labeled as selfish for our pursuits.
 It really comes down to what is considered acceptable on a society level as well as a local level. 

So it it selfish to participate in extreme sports? I would have to say not necessarily. There are too many factors that can come into play to be able to say what is or is not selfish.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life. Younger people who are single and have no children may be willing to take on a greater level of risk than another person who is older and more established.However, I know some very good athletes in their 50s and 60s who are still climbing in places like Yosemite and the Coast Range.
 They decided for themselves that being more active is a risk they are willing to take. 

I feel that younger people are less likely to be judged as selfish for pursuing there more dangerous activities. When you get out of your mid-20s and reach your 30s and beyond, you start to get some looks. However, people who are teenaged to 20 something tend to be able to do whatever without any issues. They could play dangerous sports, participate in Nascar or anything in between.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life. Younger people who are single and have no children may be willing to take on a greater level of risk than another person who is older and more established.However, I know some very good athletes in their 50s and 60s who are still climbing in places like Yosemite and the Coast Range.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life. Younger people who are single and have no children may be willing to take on a greater level of risk than another person who is older and more established.However, I know some very good athletes in their 50s and 60s who are still climbing in places like Yosemite and the Coast Range.

When you get out of your mid-20s and reach your 30s and beyond, you start to get some looks. However, people who are teenaged to 20 something tend to be able to do whatever without any issues. They could play dangerous sports, participate in Nascar or anything in between. 
It also depends on where you live.
 If you are doing an extreme sport that is not common in your area then people will be more likely to judge you. But if you are doing one that is very common then that is the norm of where you live. It just goes to show the extent of how many variables play into this argument. erception is everything when it comes to being labeled as selfish for our pursuits.
 It really comes down to what is considered acceptable on a society level as well as a local level. 

So it it selfish to participate in extreme sports? I would have to say not necessarily. There are too many factors that can come into play to be able to say what is or is not selfish. I believe that each individual has to look at the level of risk they are willing to endure and do what they feel is right for them.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life. Younger people who are single and have no children may be willing to take on a greater level of risk than another person who is older and more established.However, I know some very good athletes in their 50s and 60s who are still climbing in places like Yosemite and the Coast Range.
