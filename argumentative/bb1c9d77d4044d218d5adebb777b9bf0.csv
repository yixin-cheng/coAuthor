It helps prevent, for example, buying a product local or not that the company dumps it's waste directly into the community drinking water. In that example if everyone was aware, people would stop buying that company's products in turn forcing the company to change it very harmful practices.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, yes, absolutely we can be called bad citizens for not keeping up with the news. That is because in a world that is becoming increasingly more connected and having less and less barriers, you are in direct relation with everything that happen, and people have a direct responsibility to know what is happening because their actions and the way they live their lives have a direct impact with the people that surrounds them. It helps prevent, for example, buying a product local or not that the company dumps it's waste directly into the community drinking water. In that example if everyone was aware, people would stop buying that company's products in turn forcing the company to change it very harmful practices. 

So yes, each of us do have some responsibility to know what is happening in the world, to know the communities we are a part of and it helps us take care of each other. Taking care of each other, and not just our own interests, is a part of being a good, kind, and responsible citizen.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, yes, absolutely we can be called bad citizens for not keeping up with the news. That is because in a world that is becoming increasingly more connected and having less and less barriers, you are in direct relation with everything that happen, and people have a direct responsibility to know what is happening because their actions and the way they live their lives have a direct impact with the people that surrounds them. It helps prevent, for example, buying a product local or not that the company dumps it's waste directly into the community drinking water. In that example if everyone was aware, people would stop buying that company's products in turn forcing the company to change it very harmful practices. 

So yes, each of us do have some responsibility to know what is happening in the world, to know the communities we are a part of and it helps us take care of each other. Taking care of each other, and not just our own interests, is a part of being a good, kind, and responsible citizen.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, yes, absolutely we can be called bad citizens for not keeping up with the news. That is because in a world that is becoming increasingly more connected and having less and less barriers, you are in direct relation with everything that happen, and people have a direct responsibility to know what is happening because their actions and the way they live their lives have a direct impact with the people that surrounds them. It helps prevent, for example, buying a product local or not that the company dumps it's waste directly into the community drinking water. In that example if everyone was aware, people would stop buying that company's products in turn forcing the company to change it very harmful practices. 

So yes, each of us do have some responsibility to know what is happening in the world, to know the communities we are a part of and it helps us take care of each other. Taking care of each other, and not just our own interests, is a part of being a good, kind, and responsible citizen. Not just a citizen of where we are from, but a citizen of the world and the human species.

In my opinion, yes, absolutely we can be called bad citizens for not keeping up with the news. That is because in a world that is becoming increasingly more connected and having less and less barriers, you are in direct relation with everything that happen, and people have a direct responsibility to know what is happening because their actions and the way they live their lives have a direct impact with the people that surrounds them. It helps prevent, for example, buying a product local or not that the company dumps it's waste directly into the community drinking water. In that example if everyone was aware, people would stop buying that company's products in turn forcing the company to change it very harmful practices. 

So yes, each of us do have some responsibility to know what is happening in the world, to know the communities we are a part of and it helps us take care of each other. Taking care of each other, and not just our own interests, is a part of being a good, kind, and responsible citizen. Not just a citizen of where we are from, but a citizen of the world and the human species.

It helps prevent, for example, buying a product local or not that the company dumps it's waste directly into the community drinking water. In that example if everyone was aware, people would stop buying that company's products in turn forcing the company to change it very harmful practices. 

So yes, each of us do have some responsibility to know what is happening in the world, to know the communities we are a part of and it helps us take care of each other.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, yes, absolutely we can be called bad citizens for not keeping up with the news. That is because in a world that is becoming increasingly more connected and having less and less barriers, you are in direct relation with everything that happen, and people have a direct responsibility to know what is happening because their actions and the way they live their lives have a direct impact with the people that surrounds them. It helps prevent, for example, buying a product local or not that the company dumps it's waste directly into the community drinking water. In that example if everyone was aware, people would stop buying that company's products in turn forcing the company to change it very harmful practices. 

So yes, each of us do have some responsibility to know what is happening in the world, to know the communities we are a part of and it helps us take care of each other. Taking care of each other, and not just our own interests, is a part of being a good, kind, and responsible citizen.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, yes, absolutely we can be called bad citizens for not keeping up with the news. That is because in a world that is becoming increasingly more connected and having less and less barriers, you are in direct relation with everything that happen, and people have a direct responsibility to know what is happening because their actions and the way they live their lives have a direct impact with the people that surrounds them. It helps prevent, for example, buying a product local or not that the company dumps it's waste directly into the community drinking water. In that example if everyone was aware, people would stop buying that company's products in turn forcing the company to change it very harmful practices. 

So yes, each of us do have some responsibility to know what is happening in the world, to know the communities we are a part of and it helps us take care of each other. Taking care of each other, and not just our own interests, is a part of being a good, kind, and responsible citizen.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, yes, absolutely we can be called bad citizens for not keeping up with the news. That is because in a world that is becoming increasingly more connected and having less and less barriers, you are in direct relation with everything that happen, and people have a direct responsibility to know what is happening because their actions and the way they live their lives have a direct impact with the people that surrounds them. It helps prevent, for example, buying a product local or not that the company dumps it's waste directly into the community drinking water. In that example if everyone was aware, people would stop buying that company's products in turn forcing the company to change it very harmful practices. 

So yes, each of us do have some responsibility to know what is happening in the world, to know the communities we are a part of and it helps us take care of each other. Taking care of each other, and not just our own interests, is a part of being a good, kind, and responsible citizen. Not just a citizen of where we are from, but a citizen of the world and the human species.

In my opinion, yes, absolutely we can be called bad citizens for not keeping up with the news. That is because in a world that is becoming increasingly more connected and having less and less barriers, you are in direct relation with everything that happen, and people have a direct responsibility to know what is happening because their actions and the way they live their lives have a direct impact with the people that surrounds them. It helps prevent, for example, buying a product local or not that the company dumps it's waste directly into the community drinking water. In that example if everyone was aware, people would stop buying that company's products in turn forcing the company to change it very harmful practices. 

So yes, each of us do have some responsibility to know what is happening in the world, to know the communities we are a part of and it helps us take care of each other. Taking care of each other, and not just our own interests, is a part of being a good, kind, and responsible citizen.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, yes, absolutely we can be called bad citizens for not keeping up with the news. That is because in a world that is becoming increasingly more connected and having less and less barriers, you are in direct relation with everything that happen, and people have a direct responsibility to know what is happening because their actions and the way they live their lives have a direct impact with the people that surrounds them. It helps prevent, for example, buying a product local or not that the company dumps it's waste directly into the community drinking water. In that example if everyone was aware, people would stop buying that company's products in turn forcing the company to change it very harmful practices. 

So yes, each of us do have some responsibility to know what is happening in the world, to know the communities we are a part of and it helps us take care of each other. Taking care of each other, and not just our own interests, is a part of being a good, kind, and responsible citizen. Not just a citizen of where we are from, but a citizen of the world and the human species.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, yes, absolutely we can be called bad citizens for not keeping up with the news. That is because in a world that is becoming increasingly more connected and having less and less barriers, you are in direct relation with everything that happen, and people have a direct responsibility to know what is happening because their actions and the way they live their lives have a direct impact with the people that surrounds them. It helps prevent, for example, buying a product local or not that the company dumps it's waste directly into the community drinking water. In that example if everyone was aware, people would stop buying that company's products in turn forcing the company to change it very harmful practices. 

So yes, each of us do have some responsibility to know what is happening in the world, to know the communities we are a part of and it helps us take care of each other. Taking care of each other, and not just our own interests, is a part of being a good, kind, and responsible citizen. Not just a citizen of where we are from, but a citizen of the world and the human species.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, yes, absolutely we can be called bad citizens for not keeping up with the news. That is because in a world that is becoming increasingly more connected and having less and less barriers, you are in direct relation with everything that happen, and people have a direct responsibility to know what is happening because their actions and the way they live their lives have a direct impact with the people that surrounds them. It helps prevent, for example, buying a product local or not that the company dumps it's waste directly into the community drinking water. In that example if everyone was aware, people would stop buying that company's products in turn forcing the company to change it very harmful practices. 

So yes, each of us do have some responsibility to know what is happening in the world, to know the communities we are a part of and it helps us take care of each other. Taking care of each other, and not just our own interests, is a part of being a good, kind, and responsible citizen. Not just a citizen of where we are from, but a citizen of the world and the human species.

If it were not for the news, we wouldn't know about things like global warming, or virus pandemic that could be happening around us. We wouldn't know about the social injustices that exist in other places or the natural disasters that affect us all. Therefore we would not act on these events, and that just by itself could really ourselves, and others around us.
