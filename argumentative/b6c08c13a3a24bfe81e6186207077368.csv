In my opinion, most stereotypical characters don't really make me cringe because I understand it's a movie or a TV show. Murder is offensive and wrong but when I watch a movie or television show I understand that it is just that...a movie or show.

I understand why some would get offended over stereotypical characters though. At the end of the day stereotypes are wrong and offensive. They perpetuate traits and characteristics that are way too general of a specific race, religion, etc. 

At the end of the day, Tony Soprano was a stereotype. He is one of the most beloved characters in TV history. Even by Italians who could be offended by his character. Italians loved Tony Soprano and the show in general.

You also have to remember that some television shows and movies have to include stereotypes to fit the time period they're depicted in. For example, during the slavery era there are tons of people depicted racist white people. That is a stereotype as not every single white person was a racist back then.

In my opinion, most stereotypical characters don't really make me cringe because I understand it's a movie or a TV show. Murder is offensive and wrong but when I watch a movie or television show I understand that it is just that...a movie or show.

I understand why some would get offended over stereotypical characters though. At the end of the day stereotypes are wrong and offensive. They perpetuate traits and characteristics that are way too general of a specific race, religion, etc. 

At the end of the day, Tony Soprano was a stereotype. He is one of the most beloved characters in TV history. Even by Italians who could be offended by his character. Italians loved Tony Soprano and the show in general.

You also have to remember that some television shows and movies have to include stereotypes to fit the time period they're depicted in. For example, during the slavery era there are tons of people depicted racist white people. That is a stereotype as not every single white person was a racist back then.

In my opinion, most stereotypical characters don't really make me cringe because I understand it's a movie or a TV show. Murder is offensive and wrong but when I watch a movie or television show I understand that it is just that...a movie or show.

I understand why some would get offended over stereotypical characters though. At the end of the day stereotypes are wrong and offensive. They perpetuate traits and characteristics that are way too general of a specific race, religion, etc. 

At the end of the day, Tony Soprano was a stereotype. He is one of the most beloved characters in TV history. Even by Italians who could be offended by his character. Italians loved Tony Soprano and the show in general.

You also have to remember that some television shows and movies have to include stereotypes to fit the time period they're depicted in. For example, during the slavery era there are tons of people depicted racist white people. That is a stereotype as not every single white person was a racist back then.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, most stereotypical characters don't really make me cringe because I understand it's a movie or a TV show. Murder is offensive and wrong but when I watch a movie or television show I understand that it is just that...a movie or show.

I understand why some would get offended over stereotypical characters though. At the end of the day stereotypes are wrong and offensive. They perpetuate traits and characteristics that are way too general of a specific race, religion, etc. 

At the end of the day, Tony Soprano was a stereotype. He is one of the most beloved characters in TV history. Even by Italians who could be offended by his character. Italians loved Tony Soprano and the show in general.

You also have to remember that some television shows and movies have to include stereotypes to fit the time period they're depicted in. For example, during the slavery era there are tons of people depicted racist white people. That is a stereotype as not every single white person was a racist back then. 

These stereotypes can also be used as a learning tool. Movies about slavery teach children why it was so horrific and why being racist is bad. Stereotypes are tricky for me when it comes to films and television. Things that would offend me in real life don't offend me in movies and television. I guess that I am just able to separate real life and movies/television. Maybe I don't buy in enough and lose myself in the media.
