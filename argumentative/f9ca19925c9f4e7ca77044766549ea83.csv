But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---
Computers and phones are here to stay. Many jobs will require emailing, talking or texting, entering data, observing charts and screens multiple times a day. It is an unescapable part of adult life. 

American adults need to worry less about our own screen time and more about letting children sit alone on screens all day. We need to let them enjoy the company of their friends online, talk to them about the huge amount of bullying and meanness in the virtual world too. And we need to talk to them about staying safe in this virtual world. But we need to be reasonable. They need to balance screen time with spending face-to-face time, enjoying the outdoors, and actually participating in activities, instead of watching them. 
Wust how much screen time is too much screen time?
  t's all a matter of balance.
 It's not just the amount of time that matters, but also what you're doing with your device. Spending time on screens might be a problem if the child is using a device to escape from the things around them or if they are ignoring their family. Screens can make you feel more isolated from your surrounding. And when you're depressed, spending more time on screen might even make things worse. 

Screen time can be useful, to learn new things,  talk with family and friends, and enjoy innocent entertainment. Once you have a good balance of activities around screen time, it isn't bad. There is a lot of evidence that video games improve hand-eye coordination and sharpen the reaction time. 

We should balance our screen time with set activities. Every hour, take a walk outside for 10 min. Play with your dog. Hug your loved ones. Vacuum. Wash the dishes. Have the kids help us, and in doing so, we'll set an example of balance they can use for the rest of their lives. 

Screens are going to be a part of their life. We just need to teach them how to balance it with other things! ",0,[],0,1,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1236
