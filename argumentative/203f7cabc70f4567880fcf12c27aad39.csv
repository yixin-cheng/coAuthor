In my opinion,  I prefer reading to listening to audiobooks. I think that using audiobook is more expensive than reading a book. You need to buy the audiobook reader such as kindle.  Audiobooks are sold and most of them have more expensive prices than I imagined.  If I just spend my time reading a book instead of listening to an audiobook, I can save money.  I think that reading is a cheap and convenient way.  To use audiobooks is an easy way but it can be complicated and expensive.  Also, reading is natural and you can enjoy it.  Listening to an audiobook is not a natural way like reading a book. For example, if you don’t understand what you hear, you can miss important information. Also, when I am in a car, listening to audiobooks make me feel bored because I can’t listen to them without paying my full attention.  My opinion is that listening to an audiobook can be useful, but reading a book is a much better way. Reading can be relaxing and self-paced. You don’t need to pay attention all the time and read anything you want. Reading makes your brain smarter too. It is possible you always have access to a book but you do not always have  a device with audiobooks in it.
