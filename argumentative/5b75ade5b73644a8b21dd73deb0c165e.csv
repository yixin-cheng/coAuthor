In my opinion, it really is selfish to pursue extreme sports. The danger and risk involved should be apparent to anyone, even those who think it is a fun ""adventure."" Do people take into consideration the feeling of those other people who love them, if something terrible happens? No, they really don't. They are only really thinking about themselves and their own pleasure, to which they are entitled by the way, but that doesn't seem the right attitude in the presence of thrills like a high risk of death for example.

People could argue that all sports are dangerous in way. The thing is, yes that's true, but most normal non-extreme sports have an incredibly low risk of causing death. In the event of mountain climbing, you are not only risking your own life, but the lives of the people who you go with because often they are tethered to you with a rope. So not only are you going to affect the lives of the ones that love you, but also the lives of the ones that love them.  That seems pretty selfish to me. Just my opinion on it.
In my opinion, if the own government discourages the sport that you are pursuing because it is too dangerous, then maybe you should listen to
 them sometimes. They do discourage extreme sports also. There was a news story on it, many of them as a matter of fact. Also often with the surviving members of their families. ",1787,[],1,1,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1094

People could argue that all sports are dangerous in way. The thing is, yes that's true, but most normal non-extreme sports have an incredibly low risk of causing death. In the event of mountain climbing, you are not only risking your own life, but the lives of the people who you go with because often they are tethered to you with a rope.
