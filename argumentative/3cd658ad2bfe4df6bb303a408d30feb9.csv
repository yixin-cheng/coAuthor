But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we must embrace the increased use for the time being but still be cautious of our usage. We still need to keep a balance, just less of one right now since so much of our lives can be run from home using all the different communication devices and services. 
IOverall though,  think we should embrace the benefits of our digital devices and use them to their fullest.
 We must be very mindful of our children's but adults should probably try to be as productive as possible using these technologies. We just need to keep ourselves focused on our goals and limit our fun time if or when it starts to hurt our productivity and/or personal relationships. We should also be using this time to explore new digital tools and expand our skill sets. Screen time in one form or another will eventually become an all day even when we start using augmented reality  or virtual reality. So, we should be trying to learn as much as possible about these technologies now and how they can be used to improve our lives. We should also be paying attention to the opposite. What is not working and how we can go about fixing it. Finally, it is my conclusion that adults should use this time to really engage with digital technologies to learn what works and what does not. You just need to be mindful of what you are using your screen for. Dont feel guilty either if you spend an extra hour or two playing games or on social media every once in a great while but as I suggested above, we need to focus more on productivity and expanding our skill sets",2005,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1904
