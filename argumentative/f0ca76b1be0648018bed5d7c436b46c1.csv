There's a large body of social context to animal empathy.  Nearly every culture has been taught to fear ""outsiders"" or other countries. It is easier to fear a stranger than it is to empathize with them.  With animals, many societies view them as lesser beings, tools or objects that we own.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.
