In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though.

For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean.

The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though.

For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though.

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people.

For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie.

For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people.

For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to s",1600,[],0,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1499

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people.

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though.

For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie.

For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this.

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people.

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though.

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype.

In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids.

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies. I can ",2001,[],0,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1924

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype.

In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids.

For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media.

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way.

For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media.

The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies.

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools.

For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies. I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts. I lea",2119,[],0,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,2076

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media.

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies. I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media.

In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies. I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies. I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts. I learn a lot about myself and also learn alot about different situations people can go through. ",2211,[],0,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,2192

The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies. I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts.

The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though.

The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media.

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though.

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids.

There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media.

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools.

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies. I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts. I learn a lot about myself and also learn alot about different situations people can go through. A great movie can do this as well, and sometimes hits me even stronger if done in the right way ",2307,[],0,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,2290

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids.

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies. I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts. I learn a lot about myself and also learn alot about different situations people can go through. A great movie can do this as well, and sometimes hits me even stronger if done in the right way simply because of the visual appeal added",2348,[],0,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,2331

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies.

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies. I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts. I learn a lot about myself and also learn alot about different situations people can go through.

The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies. I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts. I learn a lot about myself and also learn alot about different situations people can go through. A great movie can do this as well, and sometimes hits me even stronger if done in the right way simply because of the visual appeal added on. So in conclusion, i feel stereotype",2388,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,2398

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies. I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts. I learn a lot about myself and also learn alot about different situations people can go through. A great movie can do this as well, and sometimes hits me even stronger if done in the right way simply because of the visual appeal added on.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies. I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts. I learn a lot about myself and also learn alot about different situations people can go through. A great movie can do this as well, and sometimes hits me even stronger if done in the right way simply because of the visual appeal added on. So in conclusion, i feel stereotypes can be what makes or breaks a movie in a way. C",2437,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,2451

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies. I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts. I learn a lot about myself and also learn alot about different situations people can go through. A great movie can do this as well, and sometimes hits me even stronger if done in the right way simply because of the visual appeal added on.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies. I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts. I learn a lot about myself and also learn alot about different situations people can go through. A great movie can do this as well, and sometimes hits me even stronger if done in the right way simply because of the visual appeal added on.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies. I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts.

A great movie can do this as well, and sometimes hits me even stronger if done in the right way simply because of the visual appeal added on.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies.

I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people.

For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies. I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts. I learn a lot about myself and also learn alot about different situations people can go through. A great movie can do this as well, and sometimes hits me even stronger if done in the right way simply because of the visual appeal added on. So in conclusion, i feel stereotypes can be what makes or breaks a movie in a way.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies. I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts. I learn a lot about myself and also learn alot about different situations people can go through. A great movie can do this as well, and sometimes hits me even stronger if done in the right way simply because of the visual appeal added on.

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies. I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts. I learn a lot about myself and also learn alot about different situations people can go through. A great movie can do this as well, and sometimes hits me even stronger if done in the right way simply because of the visual appeal added on. So in conclusion, i feel stereotypes can be what makes or breaks a movie in a way.

I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts. I learn a lot about myself and also learn alot about different situations people can go through. A great movie can do this as well, and sometimes hits me even stronger if done in the right way simply because of the visual appeal added on.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way.

The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies. I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts. I learn a lot about myself and also learn alot about different situations people can go through. A great movie can do this as well, and sometimes hits me even stronger if done in the right way simply because of the visual appeal added on.

I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts. I learn a lot about myself and also learn alot about different situations people can go through. A great movie can do this as well, and sometimes hits me even stronger if done in the right way simply because of the visual appeal added on.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way.
