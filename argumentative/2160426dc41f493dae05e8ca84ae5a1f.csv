In my opinion, there is an obnoxious stereotype surrounding college fraternity and sororities. So many books, tv shows and movies make it seem like every college student in the US is a ""dude-bro"" frat boy or giggly sorority sister who drinks and parties every single night.
Many of these same films or tv shows have other major flaws, but the over-the-top fictional frat/sorority aspect
 is detrimental to the already bad views people have of Americans. 
I think it's the same reason I cringe at shows like Friday Night Lights or GCW television shows. Everyone is gorgeous and a size zero or a hard muscled jock that can eat pizza and drink beer for 4 years straight and never gain a pound. This is not a realistic view of college life.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there is an obnoxious stereotype surrounding college fraternity and sororities. So many books, tv shows and movies make it seem like every college student in the US is a ""dude-bro"" frat boy or giggly sorority sister who drinks and parties every single night.
Many of these same films or tv shows have other major flaws, but the over-the-top fictional frat/sorority aspect
 is detrimental to the already bad views people have of Americans. 
I think it's the same reason I cringe at shows like Friday Night Lights or GCW television shows. Everyone is gorgeous and a size zero or a hard muscled jock that can eat pizza and drink beer for 4 years straight and never gain a pound. This is not a realistic view of college life.

As an adult who graduated 20 years ago, the stereotypes still bother me because you now have people arguing that ""we all do dumb things when we're 18"" because they see these stereotypes playing out in books and movies.

In my opinion, there is an obnoxious stereotype surrounding college fraternity and sororities. So many books, tv shows and movies make it seem like every college student in the US is a ""dude-bro"" frat boy or giggly sorority sister who drinks and parties every single night.
Many of these same films or tv shows have other major flaws, but the over-the-top fictional frat/sorority aspect
 is detrimental to the already bad views people have of Americans. 
I think it's the same reason I cringe at shows like Friday Night Lights or GCW television shows. Everyone is gorgeous and a size zero or a hard muscled jock that can eat pizza and drink beer for 4 years straight and never gain a pound. This is not a realistic view of college life.

As an adult who graduated 20 years ago, the stereotypes still bother me because you now have people arguing that ""we all do dumb things when we're 18"" because they see these stereotypes playing out in books and movies. Little do they realize how many of those college aged students are working 2 part time jobs, being a TA and having to send money back home to help their family pay bills.

In my opinion, there is an obnoxious stereotype surrounding college fraternity and sororities. So many books, tv shows and movies make it seem like every college student in the US is a ""dude-bro"" frat boy or giggly sorority sister who drinks and parties every single night.
Many of these same films or tv shows have other major flaws, but the over-the-top fictional frat/sorority aspect
 is detrimental to the already bad views people have of Americans. 
I think it's the same reason I cringe at shows like Friday Night Lights or GCW television shows. Everyone is gorgeous and a size zero or a hard muscled jock that can eat pizza and drink beer for 4 years straight and never gain a pound. This is not a realistic view of college life.

As an adult who graduated 20 years ago, the stereotypes still bother me because you now have people arguing that ""we all do dumb things when we're 18"" because they see these stereotypes playing out in books and movies. Little do they realize how many of those college aged students are working 2 part time jobs, being a TA and having to send money back home to help their family pay bills.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there is an obnoxious stereotype surrounding college fraternity and sororities. So many books, tv shows and movies make it seem like every college student in the US is a ""dude-bro"" frat boy or giggly sorority sister who drinks and parties every single night.
Many of these same films or tv shows have other major flaws, but the over-the-top fictional frat/sorority aspect
 is detrimental to the already bad views people have of Americans. 
I think it's the same reason I cringe at shows like Friday Night Lights or GCW television shows. Everyone is gorgeous and a size zero or a hard muscled jock that can eat pizza and drink beer for 4 years straight and never gain a pound. This is not a realistic view of college life.

As an adult who graduated 20 years ago, the stereotypes still bother me because you now have people arguing that ""we all do dumb things when we're 18"" because they see these stereotypes playing out in books and movies. Little do they realize how many of those college aged students are working 2 part time jobs, being a TA and having to send money back home to help their family pay bills.

In my opinion, there is an obnoxious stereotype surrounding college fraternity and sororities. So many books, tv shows and movies make it seem like every college student in the US is a ""dude-bro"" frat boy or giggly sorority sister who drinks and parties every single night.
Many of these same films or tv shows have other major flaws, but the over-the-top fictional frat/sorority aspect
 is detrimental to the already bad views people have of Americans. 
I think it's the same reason I cringe at shows like Friday Night Lights or GCW television shows. Everyone is gorgeous and a size zero or a hard muscled jock that can eat pizza and drink beer for 4 years straight and never gain a pound. This is not a realistic view of college life.

As an adult who graduated 20 years ago, the stereotypes still bother me because you now have people arguing that ""we all do dumb things when we're 18"" because they see these stereotypes playing out in books and movies. Little do they realize how many of those college aged students are working 2 part time jobs, being a TA and having to send money back home to help their family pay bills.

In my opinion, there is an obnoxious stereotype surrounding college fraternity and sororities. So many books, tv shows and movies make it seem like every college student in the US is a ""dude-bro"" frat boy or giggly sorority sister who drinks and parties every single night.
Many of these same films or tv shows have other major flaws, but the over-the-top fictional frat/sorority aspect
 is detrimental to the already bad views people have of Americans. 
I think it's the same reason I cringe at shows like Friday Night Lights or GCW television shows. Everyone is gorgeous and a size zero or a hard muscled jock that can eat pizza and drink beer for 4 years straight and never gain a pound. This is not a realistic view of college life.

As an adult who graduated 20 years ago, the stereotypes still bother me because you now have people arguing that ""we all do dumb things when we're 18"" because they see these stereotypes playing out in books and movies. Little do they realize how many of those college aged students are working 2 part time jobs, being a TA and having to send money back home to help their family pay bills.

In my opinion, there is an obnoxious stereotype surrounding college fraternity and sororities. So many books, tv shows and movies make it seem like every college student in the US is a ""dude-bro"" frat boy or giggly sorority sister who drinks and parties every single night.
Many of these same films or tv shows have other major flaws, but the over-the-top fictional frat/sorority aspect
 is detrimental to the already bad views people have of Americans. 
I think it's the same reason I cringe at shows like Friday Night Lights or GCW television shows. Everyone is gorgeous and a size zero or a hard muscled jock that can eat pizza and drink beer for 4 years straight and never gain a pound. This is not a realistic view of college life.

As an adult who graduated 20 years ago, the stereotypes still bother me because you now have people arguing that ""we all do dumb things when we're 18"" because they see these stereotypes playing out in books and movies.
