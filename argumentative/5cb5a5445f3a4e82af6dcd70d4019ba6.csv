Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, Schools should not provide period products. This is the responsibility of the parents. Budgeting for products like pads and tampons is different from budgeting for toilet paper, soap and other products. Pad and tampons are products related to the reproductive cycle. They are tied to things such as puberty and fertility. That makes them a sensitive issue, especially among students.

 Parents don't want schools to teach their children about morality and controversial reproductive issues, therefore, they need to provide the products they want for their children.  Tampons are like deodorant. If you teach your kid that the aluminum in deodorant is causing health issues,  you should provide the product that you want your kids to use, yourself.
