In my opinion, the answer to all of these questions is a sturdy “No”. Menstruation is an important life change, but it is best addresses buy the parents. It is hard for me to imagine a parent of a young girls who had not taught their child about menstruation: it's dereliction.

So in cases where a teacher judges that a student has been surprised by her first period, there should by a mechanism in place to offer that student immediate professional help, from a nurse or social worker, outside of the classroom.

But that should only be necessary in a small number of cases. If such a mechanism were in place, I’d be all for schools providing free pads and tampons, but not publicly.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, the answer to all of these questions is a sturdy “No”. Menstruation is an important life change, but it is best addresses buy the parents. It is hard for me to imagine a parent of a young girls who had not taught their child about menstruation: it's dereliction.

Now not every girl has at least one good parent or guardian. So in cases where a teacher judges that a student has been surprised by her first period, there should by a mechanism in place to offer that student immediate professional help, from a nurse or social worker, outside of the classroom. The topic could then be discussed honestly with the student in a comfortable atmosphere, only having to deal with girls who have been surprised by their first period. That should only be necessary in a small number of cases. If such a mechanism were in place, I’d be all for schools providing free pads and tampons, but not publicly.

So in cases where a teacher judges that a student has been surprised by her first period, there should by a mechanism in place to offer that student immediate professional help, from a nurse or social worker, outside of the classroom. The topic could then be discussed honestly with the student in a comfortable atmosphere, only having to deal with girls who have been surprised by their first period. That should only be necessary in a small number of cases. If such a mechanism were in place, I’d be all for schools providing free pads and tampons, but not publicly.

In my opinion, the answer to all of these questions is a sturdy “No”. Menstruation is an important life change, but it is best addresses buy the parents. It is hard for me to imagine a parent of a young girls who had not taught their child about menstruation: it's dereliction.

Now not every girl has at least one good parent or guardian. So in cases where a teacher judges that a student has been surprised by her first period, there should by a mechanism in place to offer that student immediate professional help, from a nurse or social worker, outside of the classroom. The topic could then be discussed honestly with the student in a comfortable atmosphere, only having to deal with girls who have been surprised by their first period. That should only be necessary in a small number of cases. If such a mechanism were in place, I’d be all for schools providing free pads and tampons, but not publicly.
I don’t think that it is appropriate to educate girls about menstruation in a group setting., because that is not a role met best by the schools. Schools should be responsible for what goes in young girl's brains, not their vaginas. Without a doubt, the value and importance of education should not tied to our ability to arm our young people with facts, not tampons.
In an ideal world, every young woman would have at least one good parent or guardian who teaches her about menstruation.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, the answer to all of these questions is a sturdy “No”. Menstruation is an important life change, but it is best addressed by the parents. It is hard for me to imagine a parent of a young girl who had not taught their child about menstruation. Tt's dereliction.

In an ideal world, every young woman would have at least one good parent or guardian who teaches her about menstruation. But not every girl has at least one good parent or guardian. So in cases where a teacher judges that a student has been surprised by her first period, there should by a mechanism in place to offer that student immediate professional help, from a nurse or social worker, outside of the classroom. The topic could then be discussed honestly with the student in a comfortable atmosphere, only having to deal with girls who have been surprised by their first period. That should only be necessary in a small number of cases. If such a mechanism were in place, I’d be all for schools providing free pads and tampons, but not publicly.
I don’t think that it is appropriate to educate girls about menstruation in a group setting., because that is not a role met best by the schools. 

Schools should be responsible for what goes in young girl's brains, not their vaginas. The value and importance of education should not tied to our ability to arm our young people with facts, not tampons.

In an ideal world, every young woman would have at least one good parent or guardian who teaches her about menstruation. But not every girl has at least one good parent or guardian. So in cases where a teacher judges that a student has been surprised by her first period, there should by a mechanism in place to offer that student immediate professional help, from a nurse or social worker, outside of the classroom. The topic could then be discussed honestly with the student in a comfortable atmosphere, only having to deal with girls who have been surprised by their first period. That should only be necessary in a small number of cases. If such a mechanism were in place, I’d be all for schools providing free pads and tampons, but not publicly.
I don’t think that it is appropriate to educate girls about menstruation in a group setting., because that is not a role met best by the schools. 

Schools should be responsible for what goes in young girl's brains, not their vaginas. The value and importance of education should not tied to our ability to arm our young people with facts, not tampons.

I don’t think that it is appropriate to educate girls about menstruation in a group setting., because that is not a role met best by the schools. 

Schools should be responsible for what goes in young girls' brains, not their vaginas. The value and importance of education should not tied to our ability to arm our young people with facts, not tampons.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, the answer to all of these questions is a sturdy “No”. Menstruation is an important life change, but it is best addressed by the parents. It is hard for me to imagine a parent of a young girl who had not taught their child about menstruation. That would be a clear dereliction.

In an ideal world, every young woman would have at least one good parent or guardian who teaches her about menstruation. But not every girl has at least one good parent or guardian. So in cases where a teacher judges that a student has been surprised by her first period, there should by a mechanism in place to offer that student immediate professional help, from a nurse or social worker, outside of the classroom. The topic could then be discussed honestly with the student in a comfortable atmosphere, only having to deal with girls who have been surprised by their first period. That should only be necessary in a small number of cases. If such a mechanism were in place, I’d be all for schools providing free pads and tampons, but not publicly.
