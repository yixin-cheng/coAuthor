In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports.

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports. What are we going to watch instead? E-sports? Where ""athletes"" are just sitting on their computer and mouse and keyboard and doing absolutely nothing except for playing a video game? We hear those commentators say things like, ""the character killed about 15 people in one match,"" and we call that a sport? Just give me a break.

We hear those commentators say things like, ""the character killed about 15 people in one match,"" and we call that a sport? Just give me a break.

I know I sound a little bit angry, but wouldn't you be? I've read our history books when there were no safety involved and people just went all in, doing whatever they felt like doing.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports.

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports.

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports. What are we going to watch instead? E-sports? Where ""athletes"" are just sitting on their computer and mouse and keyboard and doing absolutely nothing except for playing a video game? We hear those commentators say things like, ""the character killed about 15 people in one match,"" and we call that a sport? Just give me a break.

I know I sound a little bit angry, but wouldn't you be? I've read our history books when there were no safety involved and people just went all in, doing whatever they felt like doing. We did not get stories about plain old men dying of chest injuries incurred during sports because the protective chest plates was too heavy to come with them everywhere, or protectors were not available, no. We heard stories of mighty men overcoming their fears and coming out on top. Stories like ",2275,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1481

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports. What are we going to watch instead? E-sports? Where ""athletes"" are just sitting on their computer and mouse and keyboard and doing absolutely nothing except for playing a video game? We hear those commentators say things like, ""the character killed about 15 people in one match,"" and we call that a sport? Just give me a break.

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports. What are we going to watch instead? E-sports? Where ""athletes"" are just sitting on their computer and mouse and keyboard and doing absolutely nothing except for playing a video game? We hear those commentators say things like, ""the character killed about 15 people in one match,"" and we call that a sport? Just give me a break.

I know I sound a little bit angry, but wouldn't you be? I've read our history books when there were no safety involved and people just went all in, doing whatever they felt like doing. We did not get stories about plain old men dying of chest injuries incurred during sports because the protective chest plates was too heavy to come with them everywhere, or protectors were not available, no. We heard stories of mighty men overcoming their fears and coming out on top. Stories like those helped shape our culture, and those stories are sometimes what we want to emulate. Stories of overcoming something despite the odds or because of the odds, that's what makes for a powerful tale. ",2476,[],4,4,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1534

I know I sound a little bit angry, but wouldn't you be? I've read our history books when there were no safety involved and people just went all in, doing whatever they felt like doing. We did not get stories about plain old men dying of chest injuries incurred during sports because the protective chest plates was too heavy to come with them everywhere, or protectors were not available, no. We heard stories of mighty men overcoming their fears and coming out on top. Stories like those helped shape our culture, and those stories are sometimes what we want to emulate. Stories of overcoming something despite the odds or because of the odds, that's what makes for a powerful tale. If we stopped trying, if we stopped taking risks or stopped offering them, then aren't we depriving ourselves of knowing what the meaning of challenge really is?

It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports. What are we going to watch instead? E-sports? Where ""athletes"" are just sitting on their computer and mouse and keyboard and doing absolutely nothing except for playing a video game? We hear those commentators say things like, ""the character killed about 15 people in one match,"" and we call that a sport? Just give me a break.

I know I sound a little bit angry, but wouldn't you be? I've read our history books when there were no safety involved and people just went all in, doing whatever they felt like doing. We did not get stories about plain old men dying of chest injuries incurred during sports because the protective chest plates was too heavy to come with them everywhere, or protectors were not available, no. We heard stories of mighty men overcoming their fears and coming out on top. Stories like those helped shape our culture, and those stories are sometimes what we want to emulate. Stories of overcoming something despite the odds or because of the odds, that's what makes for a powerful tale. If we stopped trying, if we stopped taking risks or stopped offering them, then aren't we depriving ourselves of knowing what the meaning of challenge really is?
