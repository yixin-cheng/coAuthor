In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks.

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. 

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money",2281,[],0,,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1363

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. 

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. 

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. 

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. 

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. 

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. 

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. 

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. 

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.

The scholarship argument doesn't hold weight. Non-monetary perks don't hold weight. The only difficult I can think of regarding students getting paid is them not knowing how to manage their money. A simple solution to that is to have t",2553,[],0,,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1641

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. 

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.

The scholarship argument doesn't hold weight. Non-monetary perks don't hold weight. The only difficult I can think of regarding students getting paid is them not knowing how to manage their money. A simple solution to that is to have the money held",2566,[],0,,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1654

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. 

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.

The scholarship argument doesn't hold weight. Non-monetary perks don't hold weight. The only difficult I can think of regarding students getting paid is them not knowing how to manage their money. A simple solution to that is to have the money held up in a bank account until they graduate or are drafted to a professional sports league",2654,[],0,,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1758

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. 

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.

The scholarship argument doesn't hold weight. Non-monetary perks don't hold weight. The only difficult I can think of regarding students getting paid is them not knowing how to manage their money. A simple solution to that is to have the money held up in a bank account until they graduate or are drafted to a professional sports league. You can eve",2667,[],0,,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1771

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. 

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. 

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.

The scholarship argument doesn't hold weight. Non-monetary perks don't hold weight. The only difficult I can think of regarding students getting paid is them not knowing how to manage their money. A simple solution to that is to have the money held up in a bank account until they graduate or are drafted to a professional sports league.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. 

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.

The scholarship argument doesn't hold weight. Non-monetary perks don't hold weight. The only difficult I can think of regarding students getting paid is them not knowing how to manage their money. A simple solution to that is to have the money held up in a bank account until they graduate or are drafted to a professional sports league.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. 

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.

The scholarship argument doesn't hold weight. Non-monetary perks don't hold weight. The only difficult I can think of regarding students getting paid is them not knowing how to manage their money. A simple solution to that is to have the money held up in a bank account until they graduate or are drafted to a professional sports league.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. 

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.

The scholarship argument doesn't hold weight. Non-monetary perks don't hold weight. The only difficult I can think of regarding students getting paid is them not knowing how to manage their money. A simple solution to that is to have the money held up in a bank account until they graduate or are drafted to a professional sports league.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. 

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.

The scholarship argument doesn't hold weight. Non-monetary perks don't hold weight. The only difficult I can think of regarding students getting paid is them not knowing how to manage their money. A simple solution to that is to have the money held up in a bank account until they graduate or are drafted to a professional sports league.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. 

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.

The scholarship argument doesn't hold weight. Non-monetary perks don't hold weight. The only difficult I can think of regarding students getting paid is them not knowing how to manage their money. A simple solution to that is to have the money held up in a bank account until they graduate or are drafted to a professional sports league. You can even put a caveat in where they have to maintain a specific GPA average or else they get fined. That would be motivation enough for them to ",2804,[],0,,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1908

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. 

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.

The scholarship argument doesn't hold weight. Non-monetary perks don't hold weight. The only difficult I can think of regarding students getting paid is them not knowing how to manage their money. A simple solution to that is to have the money held up in a bank account until they graduate or are drafted to a professional sports league. You can even put a caveat in where they have to maintain a specific GPA average or else they get fined. That would be motivation enough for them to better their",2816,[],0,,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1920

I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. 

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.

The scholarship argument doesn't hold weight. Non-monetary perks don't hold weight. The only difficult I can think of regarding students getting paid is them not knowing how to manage their money. A simple solution to that is to have the money held up in a bank account until they graduate or are drafted to a professional sports league. You can even put a caveat in where they have to maintain a specific GPA average or else they get fined. That would be motivation enough for them to better their academics.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping.

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.

The scholarship argument doesn't hold weight. Non-monetary perks don't hold weight. The only difficult I can think of regarding students getting paid is them not knowing how to manage their money. A simple solution to that is to have the money held up in a bank account until they graduate or are drafted to a professional sports league. You can even put a caveat in where they have to maintain a specific GPA average or else they get fined. That would be motivation enough for them to better their academics.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks.

The scholarship argument doesn't hold weight. Non-monetary perks don't hold weight. The only difficult I can think of regarding students getting paid is them not knowing how to manage their money. A simple solution to that is to have the money held up in a bank account until they graduate or are drafted to a professional sports league.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

The scholarship argument doesn't hold weight. Non-monetary perks don't hold weight. The only difficult I can think of regarding students getting paid is them not knowing how to manage their money. A simple solution to that is to have the money held up in a bank account until they graduate or are drafted to a professional sports league.

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks.

I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. 

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.

The scholarship argument doesn't hold weight. Non-monetary perks don't hold weight. The only difficult I can think of regarding students getting paid is them not knowing how to manage their money. A simple solution to that is to have the money held up in a bank account until they graduate or are drafted to a professional sports league. You can even put a caveat in where they have to maintain a specific GPA average or else they get fined. That would be motivation enough for them to better their academics.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping.
