In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. P",1049,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,544

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost poss",1204,[],1,1,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,740

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier.

Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going.

For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us.

For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology.

Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us.

For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean?

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a ",1735,[],3,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1153

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into ",1751,[],3,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1170

I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love Netflixing",1930,[],0,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1280

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move.

I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I",1950,[],0,2,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1326

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean?

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going.

For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up.

Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it.

I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of ",2197,[],1,1,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1586

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology.

We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

So in conclusion, I think that technology is generally a good thing for dating and relationships, but it can be a bad thing if you're not careful. J",2669,[],2,2,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1710

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

So in conclusion, I think that technology is generally a good thing for dating and relationships, but it can be a bad thing if you're not careful. Just don't get sucked into petty drama through technology and instea",2736,[],2,2,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1779

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

So in conclusion, I think that technology is generally a good thing for dating and relationships, but it can be a bad thing if you're not careful. Just don't get sucked into petty drama through technology and instead use technology to e",2757,[],2,2,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1802

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

So in conclusion, I think that technology is generally a good thing for dating and relationships, but it can be a bad thing if you're not careful. Just don't get sucked into petty drama through technology and instead use technology to enhance your relationship and",2785,[],2,2,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1836

Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

So in conclusion, I think that technology is generally a good thing for dating and relationships, but it can be a bad thing if you're not careful. Just don't get sucked into petty drama through technology and instead use technology to enhance your relationship and make it stronger. Th",2806,[],1,1,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1847

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

So in conclusion, I think that technology is generally a good thing for dating and relationships, but it can be a bad thing if you're not careful.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

So in conclusion, I think that technology is generally a good thing for dating and relationships, but it can be a bad thing if you're not careful. Just don't get sucked into petty drama through technology and instead use technology to enhance your relationship and make it stronger. That's what I do, and it's worked out pretty well for me.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

So in conclusion, I think that technology is generally a good thing for dating and relationships, but it can be a bad thing if you're not careful. Just don't get sucked into petty drama through technology and instead use technology to enhance your relationship and make it stronger. That's what I do, and it's worked out pretty well for me.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier.

I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

So in conclusion, I think that technology is generally a good thing for dating and relationships, but it can be a bad thing if you're not careful. Just don't get sucked into petty drama through technology and instead use technology to enhance your relationship and make it stronger. That's what I do, and it's worked out pretty well for me.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

So in conclusion, I think that technology is generally a good thing for dating and relationships, but it can be a bad thing if you're not careful.

I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

So in conclusion, I think that technology is generally a good thing for dating and relationships, but it can be a bad thing if you're not careful. Just don't get sucked into petty drama through technology and instead use technology to enhance your relationship and make it stronger. That's what I do, and it's worked out pretty well for me.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it.

We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

So in conclusion, I think that technology is generally a good thing for dating and relationships, but it can be a bad thing if you're not careful. Just don't get sucked into petty drama through technology and instead use technology to enhance your relationship and make it stronger. That's what I do, and it's worked out pretty well for me.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

So in conclusion, I think that technology is generally a good thing for dating and relationships, but it can be a bad thing if you're not careful.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

So in conclusion, I think that technology is generally a good thing for dating and relationships, but it can be a bad thing if you're not careful. Just don't get sucked into petty drama through technology and instead use technology to enhance your relationship and make it stronger. That's what I do, and it's worked out pretty well for me.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one.

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. Though I have neveI've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

So in conclusion, I think that technology is generally a good thing for dating and relationships, but it can be a bad thing if you're not careful. Just don't get sucked into petty drama through technology and instead use technology to enhance your relationship and make it stronger. That's what I do, and it's worked out pretty well for me.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

So in conclusion, I think that technology is generally a good thing for dating and relationships, but it can be a bad thing if you're not careful. Just don't get sucked into petty drama through technology and instead use technology to enhance your relationship and make it stronger. That's what I do, and it's worked out pretty well for me.

For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

So in conclusion, I think that technology is generally a good thing for dating and relationships, but it can be a bad thing if you're not careful. Just don't get sucked into petty drama through technology and instead use technology to enhance your relationship and make it stronger. That's what I do, and it's worked out pretty well for me. My boyfriend and I are going strong and it's all thanks to the wonderful world of technology.",550,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1998
