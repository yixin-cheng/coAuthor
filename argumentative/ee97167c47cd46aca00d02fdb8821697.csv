In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go.  I love to read, don't get me wrong.  But reading is way more limited than listening to an audiobook.  I can listen to a book while I am walking, driving, or doing the dishes.  I can hear a story anytime that I don't have to be listening or concentrating on something else.  And audiobooks are great for my eyes.  My eyesight isn't what it used to be, and when I read for long periods I suffer from eyestrain.  

Audiobooks are also great for kids with learning disabilities, or that can't concentrate.  It also allows children in general to hear stories that they may not have been able to read because their reading isn't advanced enough yet.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go.  I love to read, don't get me wrong.  But reading is way more limited than listening to an audiobook.  I can listen to a book while I am walking, driving, or doing the dishes.  I can't imagine somI can hear a story anytime that I don't have to be listening or concentrating on something else.  And audiobooks are great for my eyes.  My eyesight isn't what it used to be, and when I read for long periods I suffer from eyestrain.  

Audiobooks are also great for kids with learning disabilities, or that can't concentrate.  It also allows children in general to hear stories that they may not have been able to read because their reading isn't advanced enough yet.  Although we need to take care that children learn to read the words they hear at the appropriate time in their learning cycle.  Use of different voices are more engaging for a child as well, and they can still use their imaginations as they think about what the characters and their actions look loke.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go.  I love to read, don't get me wrong.  But reading is way more limited than listening to an audiobook.  I can listen to a book while I am walking, driving, or doing the dishes.  I can't imagine some of the long driving trips I've taken by myself without an audiobook to listen to.  They've kept me alert and safe on those drives.  I can hear a story anytime that I don't have to be listening or concentrating on something else.  And audiobooks are great for my eyes.  My eyesight isn't what it used to be, and when I read for long periods I suffer from eyestrain.  

Audiobooks are also great for kids with learning disabilities, or that can't concentrate.  It also allows children in general to hear stories that they may not have been able to read because their reading isn't advanced enough yet.  Although we need to take care that children learn to read the words they hear at the appropriate time in their learning cycle.  Use of different voices are more engaging for a child as well, and they can still use their imaginations as they think about what the characters and their actions look like.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go.  I love to read, don't get me wrong.  But reading is way more limited than listening to an audiobook.  I can listen to a book while I am walking, driving, or doing the dishes.  I can't imagine some of the long driving trips I've taken by myself without an audiobook to listen to.  They've kept me alert and safe on those drives.  I can hear a story anytime that I don't have to be listening or concentrating on something else.  And audiobooks are great for my eyes.  My eyesight isn't what it used to be, and when I read for long periods I suffer from eyestrain.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go.  I love to read, don't get me wrong.  But reading is way more limited than listening to an audiobook.  I can listen to a book while I am walking, driving, or doing the dishes.  I can't imagine some of the long driving trips I've taken by myself without an audiobook to listen to.  They've kept me alert and safe on those drives.  I can hear a story anytime that I don't have to be listening or concentrating on something else.  And audiobooks are great for my eyes.  My eyesight isn't what it used to be, and when I read for long periods I suffer from eyestrain.  

Audiobooks are also great for kids with learning disabilities, or that can't concentrate.  It also allows children in general to hear stories that they may not have been able to read because their reading isn't advanced enough yet.  Although we need to take care that children learn to read the words they hear at the appropriate time in their learning cycle.  Use of different voices are more engaging for a child as well, and they can still use their imaginations as they think about what the characters and their actions look like.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go.  I love to read, don't get me wrong.  But reading is way more limited than listening to an audiobook.  I can listen to a book while I am walking, driving, or doing the dishes.  I can't imagine some of the long driving trips I've taken by myself without an audiobook to listen to.  They've kept me alert and safe on those drives.  I can hear a story anytime that I don't have to be listening or concentrating on something else.  And audiobooks are great for my eyes.  My eyesight isn't what it used to be, and when I read for long periods I suffer from eyestrain.  

Audiobooks are also great for kids with learning disabilities, or that can't concentrate.  It also allows children in general to hear stories that they may not have been able to read because their reading isn't advanced enough yet.  Although we need to take care that children learn to read the words they hear at the appropriate time in their learning cycle.  Use of different voices are more engaging for a child as well, and they can still use their imaginations as they think about what the characters and their actions look like.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go.  I love to read, don't get me wrong.  But reading is way more limited than listening to an audiobook.  I can listen to a book while I am walking, driving, or doing the dishes.  I can't imagine some of the long driving trips I've taken by myself without an audiobook to listen to.  They've kept me alert and safe on those drives.  I can hear a story anytime that I don't have to be listening or concentrating on something else.  And audiobooks are great for my eyes.  My eyesight isn't what it used to be, and when I read for long periods I suffer from eyestrain.

Use of different voices are more engaging for a child as well, and they can still use their imaginations as they think about what the characters and their actions look like.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go.  I love to read, don't get me wrong.  But reading is way more limited than listening to an audiobook.  I can listen to a book while I am walking, driving, or doing the dishes.  I can't imagine some of the long driving trips I've taken by myself without an audiobook to listen to.  They've kept me alert and safe on those drives.  I can hear a story anytime that I don't have to be listening or concentrating on something else.  And audiobooks are great for my eyes.  My eyesight isn't what it used to be, and when I read for long periods I suffer from eyestrain.  

Audiobooks are also great for kids with learning disabilities, or that can't concentrate.  It also allows children in general to hear stories that they may not have been able to read because their reading isn't advanced enough yet.  Although we need to take care that children learn to read the words they hear at the appropriate time in their learning cycle.  Use of different voices are more engaging for a child as well, and they can still use their imaginations as they think about what the characters and their actions look like.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go.  I love to read, don't get me wrong.  But reading is way more limited than listening to an audiobook.  I can listen to a book while I am walking, driving, or doing the dishes.  I can't imagine some of the long driving trips I've taken by myself without an audiobook to listen to.  They've kept me alert and safe on those drives.  I can hear a story anytime that I don't have to be listening or concentrating on something else.  And audiobooks are great for my eyes.  My eyesight isn't what it used to be, and when I read for long periods I suffer from eyestrain.  

Audiobooks are also great for kids with learning disabilities, or that can't concentrate.  It also allows children in general to hear stories that they may not have been able to read because their reading isn't advanced enough yet.  Although we need to take care that children learn to read the words they hear at the appropriate time in their learning cycle.  Use of different voices are more engaging for a child as well, and they can still use their imaginations as they think about what the characters and their actions look like.

Another benefit of audiobooks is environmental.  They don't require use of paper or other materials, particularly when downloaded.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go.  I love to read, don't get me wrong.  But reading is way more limited than listening to an audiobook.  I can listen to a book while I am walking, driving, or doing the dishes.  I can't imagine some of the long driving trips I've taken by myself without an audiobook to listen to.  They've kept me alert and safe on those drives.  I can hear a story anytime that I don't have to be listening or concentrating on something else.  And audiobooks are great for my eyes.  My eyesight isn't what it used to be, and when I read for long periods I suffer from eyestrain.  

Audiobooks are also great for kids with learning disabilities, or that can't concentrate.  It also allows children in general to hear stories that they may not have been able to read because their reading isn't advanced enough yet.  Although we need to take care that children learn to read the words they hear at the appropriate time in their learning cycle.  Use of different voices are more engaging for a child as well, and they can still use their imaginations as they think about what the characters and their actions look like.

Another benefit of audiobooks is environmental.  They don't require use of paper or other materials, particularly when downloaded.

I can listen to a book while I am walking, driving, or doing the dishes.  I can't imagine some of the long driving trips I've taken by myself without an audiobook to listen to.

I can listen to a book while I am walking, driving, or doing the dishes.  I can't imagine some of the long driving trips I've taken by myself without an audiobook to listen to.  They've kept me alert and safe on those drives.  I can hear a story anytime that I don't have to be listening or concentrating on something else.  And audiobooks are great for my eyes.  My eyesight isn't what it used to be, and when I read for long periods I suffer from eyestrain.

Although we need to take care that children learn to read the words they hear at the appropriate time in their learning cycle.  Use of different voices are more engaging for a child as well, and they can still use their imaginations as they think about what the characters and their actions look like.

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go.  I love to read, don't get me wrong.  But reading is way more limited than listening to an audiobook.  I can listen to a book while I am walking, driving, or doing the dishes.  I can't imagine some of the long driving trips I've taken by myself without an audiobook to listen to.  They've kept me alert and safe on those drives.  I can hear a story anytime that I don't have to be listening or concentrating on something else.  And audiobooks are great for my eyes.  My eyesight isn't what it used to be, and when I read for long periods I suffer from eyestrain.

They've kept me alert and safe on those drives.  I can hear a story anytime that I don't have to be listening or concentrating on something else.
