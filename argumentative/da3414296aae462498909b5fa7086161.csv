In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

I like to watch the news because I like to be up to date with everything. It also can help me start up or jump into conversations. The more you know, the easier it is to socialize with others.

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

I like to watch the news because I like to be up to date with everything. It also can help me start up or jump into conversations. The more you know, the easier it is to socialize with others.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

I like to watch the news because I like to be up to date with everything. It also can help me start up or jump into conversations. The more you know, the easier it is to socialize with others.

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

I like to watch the news because I like to be up to date with everything. It also can help me start up or jump into conversations. The more you know, the easier it is to socialize with others.

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

I like to watch the news because I like to be up to date with everything. It also can help me start up or jump into conversations. The more you know, the easier it is to socialize with others.

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

I like to watch the news because I like to be up to date with everything. It also can help me start up or jump into conversations. The more you know, the easier it is to socialize with others.

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

I like to watch the news because I like to be up to date with everything. It also can help me start up or jump into conversations. The more you know, the easier it is to socialize with others.

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

I like to watch the news because I like to be up to date with everything. It also can help me start up or jump into conversations. The more you know, the easier it is to socialize with others.

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

I like to watch the news because I like to be up to date with everything. It also can help me start up or jump into conversations. The more you know, the easier it is to socialize with others.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

I like to watch the news because I like to be up to date with everything. It also can help me start up or jump into conversations. The more you know, the easier it is to socialize with others. 

I think the news became much more of a polarizing topic ever since Donald Trump called the mainstream media out for promoting fake news stories. I think that has hurt the trust factor between the people who are giving the news a

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

I like to watch the news because I like to be up to date with everything. It also can help me start up or jump into conversations. The more you know, the easier it is to socialize with others. 

I think the news became much more of a polarizing topic ever since Donald Trump called the mainstream media out for promoting fake news stories. I think that has hurt the trust factor between the people who are giving the news and the people who are receiving the news. They don't know what to trust.

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

I like to watch the news because I like to be up to date with everything. It also can help me start up or jump into conversations. The more you know, the easier it is to socialize with others. 

I think the news became much more of a polarizing topic ever since Donald Trump called the mainstream media out for promoting fake news stories. I think that has hurt the trust factor between the people who are giving the news and the people who are receiving the news. They don't know what to trust.

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

I like to watch the news because I like to be up to date with everything. It also can help me start up or jump into conversations. The more you know, the easier it is to socialize with others. 

I think the news became much more of a polarizing topic ever since Donald Trump called the mainstream media out for promoting fake news stories. I think that has hurt the trust factor between the people who are giving the news and the people who are receiving the news. They don't know what to trust.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

I like to watch the news because I like to be up to date with everything. It also can help me start up or jump into conversations. The more you know, the easier it is to socialize with others. 

I think the news became much more of a polarizing topic ever since Donald Trump called the mainstream media out for promoting fake news stories. I think that has hurt the trust factor between the people who are giving the news and the people who are receiving the news. They don't know what to trust. 

I will continue to watch the news and I won't judge others if they prefer not to.

You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

I like to watch the news because I like to be up to date with everything. It also can help me start up or jump into conversations. The more you know, the easier it is to socialize with others. 

I think the news became much more of a polarizing topic ever since Donald Trump called the mainstream media out for promoting fake news stories. I think that has hurt the trust factor between the people who are giving the news and the people who are receiving the news. They don't know what to trust. 

I will continue to watch the news and I won't judge others if they prefer not to. Do what works for you

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.
