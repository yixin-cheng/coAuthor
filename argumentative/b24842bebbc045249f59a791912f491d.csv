Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are bl",1169,[],0,4,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,362

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive.

Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create.

Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create.

Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and t Lone Ranger, but now seen as racist and politically incorrect.",1433,[],0,4,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,547

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. M",1643,[],0,2,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,671

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive.

Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create.

Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have ste",1757,[],0,4,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,802

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.

Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.

Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.

Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive.

Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.  The 'bad father', the 'overworked single mother', the 'depressed woman with a cat', the 'female character who is more capable, smarter, and morally virtuous than any of the male characters' are all examples of modern stereotypes that are ac",2008,[],0,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,987

Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances.

Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.  The 'bad father', the 'overworked single mother', the 'depressed woman with a cat', the 'female character who is more capable, smarter, and morally virtuous than any of the male characters' are all examples of modern stereotypes that are acceptable now, but will one day doubtless be viewed as ",2062,[],0,1,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1051

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.  The 'bad father', the 'overworked single mother', the 'depressed woman with a cat', the 'female character who is more capable, smarter, and morally virtuous than any of the male characters' are all examples of modern stereotypes that are acceptable now, but will one day doubtless be viewed as offensive, dated, and in bad taste, to the same exten",2115,[],0,1,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1082

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.  The 'bad father', the 'overworked single mother', the 'depressed woman with a cat', the 'female character who is more capable, smarter, and morally virtuous than any of the male characters' are all examples of modern stereotypes that are acceptable now, but will one day doubtless be viewed as offensive, dated, and in bad taste, to the same extent Uncle Remus is now.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.  The 'bad father', the 'overworked single mother', the 'depressed woman with a cat', the 'female character who is more capable, smarter, and morally virtuous than any of the male characters' are all examples of modern stereotypes that are acceptable now, but will one day doubtless be viewed as offensive, dated, and in bad taste, to the same extent Uncle Remus is now.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.  The 'bad father', the 'overworked single mother', the 'depressed woman with a cat', the 'female character who is more capable, smarter, and morally virtuous than any of the male characters' are all examples of modern stereotypes that are acceptable now, but will one day doubtless be viewed as offensive, dated, and in bad taste, to the same extent Uncle Remus is now.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

The 'bad father', the 'overworked single mother', the 'depressed woman with a cat', the 'female character who is more capable, smarter, and morally virtuous than any of the male characters' are all examples of modern stereotypes that are acceptable now, but will one day doubtless be viewed as offensive, dated, and in bad taste, to the same extent Uncle Remus is now.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.  The 'bad father', the 'overworked single mother', the 'depressed woman with a cat', the 'female character who is more capable, smarter, and morally virtuous than any of the male characters' are all examples of modern stereotypes that are acceptable now, but will one day doubtless be viewed as offensive, dated, and in bad taste, to the same extent Uncle Remus is now.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.  The 'bad father', the 'overworked single mother', the 'depressed woman with a cat', the 'female character who is more capable, smarter, and morally virtuous than any of the male characters' are all examples of modern stereotypes that are acceptable now, but will one day doubtless be viewed as offensive, dated, and in bad taste, to the same extent Uncle Remus is now.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.

Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.  The 'bad father', the 'overworked single mother', the 'depressed woman with a cat', the 'female character who is more capable, smarter, and morally virtuous than any of the male characters' are all examples of modern stereotypes that are acceptable now, but will one day doubtless be viewed as offensive, dated, and in bad taste, to the same extent Uncle Remus is now.

So I personally, accept stereotypes in fiction, and would never turn down or run from a book or a film because of its presence. I try to see b",2280,[],0,1,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1230

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.  The 'bad father', the 'overworked single mother', the 'depressed woman with a cat', the 'female character who is more capable, smarter, and morally virtuous than any of the male characters' are all examples of modern stereotypes that are acceptable now, but will one day doubtless be viewed as offensive, dated, and in bad taste, to the same extent Uncle Remus is now.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create.

Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.  The 'bad father', the 'overworked single mother', the 'depressed woman with a cat', the 'female character who is more capable, smarter, and morally virtuous than any of the male characters' are all examples of modern stereotypes that are acceptable now, but will one day doubtless be viewed as offensive, dated, and in bad taste, to the same extent Uncle Remus is now.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances.

Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.  The 'bad father', the 'overworked single mother', the 'depressed woman with a cat', the 'female character who is more capable, smarter, and morally virtuous than any of the male characters' are all examples of modern stereotypes that are acceptable now, but will one day doubtless be viewed as offensive, dated, and in bad taste, to the same extent Uncle Remus is now.

So I personally, accept stereotypes in fiction, and would never turn down or run from a book or a film because of its presence. I try to see beyond the stereotype. to the universal story that the writer is attempting to tell, and encourage other readers and viewers to approach ",2416,[],0,2,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1370

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.  The 'bad father', the 'overworked single mother', the 'depressed woman with a cat', the 'female character who is more capable, smarter, and morally virtuous than any of the male characters' are all examples of modern stereotypes that are acceptable now, but will one day doubtless be viewed as offensive, dated, and in bad taste, to the same extent Uncle Remus is now.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create.

Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.  The 'bad father', the 'overworked single mother', the 'depressed woman with a cat', the 'female character who is more capable, smarter, and morally virtuous than any of the male characters' are all examples of modern stereotypes that are acceptable now, but will one day doubtless be viewed as offensive, dated, and in bad taste, to the same extent Uncle Remus is now.

So I personally, accept stereotypes in fiction, and would never turn down or run from a book or a film because of its presence.
