Girls should be taught about their bodies and how to take care of them in health or sex education class, along with boys. So, regardless of what they've been taught at home, the school should aim to ensure that no young woman is startled, or dismayed, if she has her first period at school, and of course , that she has the necessary supplies to deal with it.

Girls should be taught about their bodies and how to take care of them in health or sex education class, along with boys. So, regardless of what they've been taught at home, the school should aim to ensure that no young woman is startled, or dismayed, if she has her first period at school, and of course , that she has the necessary supplies to deal with it.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, or Band-Aids? hey are all hygiene products that are necessary ,fat times, or a person's health and well-being.
 How are they different? They are only different because they are often not provided for free in schools, and they are only used by girls. This is not a coincidence. The reason they aren't provided to girls, is because of the stigma around periods, as expressed by the patriarchy, and represents a form of discrimination against women. It's sexism, plain and simple.

So, this is something that needs to be addressed along with all the other manifestations of patriarchal sexism that are still present in our schools, holding girls down. In this sense, it represents a tremendous opportunity, because it is something that can be changed, and it is something that can be changed immediately, and it could be used as a simple 'lever' to help bring the entire patriarchy tumbling down.

Girls should be taught about their bodies and how to take care of them in health or sex education class, along with boys.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, the topic of periods is often still taboo, but it shouldn't be. Girls should be taught about their bodies and how to take care of them in health or sex education class, along with boys. So, regardless of what they've been taught at home, the school should aim to ensure that no young woman is startled, or dismayed, if she has her first period at school, and of course , that she has the necessary supplies to deal with it.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, or Band-Aids? hey are all hygiene products that are necessary ,fat times, or a person's health and well-being.
 How are they different? They are only different because they are often not provided for free in schools, and they are only used by girls. This is not a coincidence. The reason they aren't provided to girls, is because of the stigma around periods, as expressed by the patriarchy, and represents a form of discrimination against women. It's sexism, plain and simple.

So, this is something that needs to be addressed along with all the other manifestations of patriarchal sexism that are still present in our schools, holding girls down. In this sense, it represents a tremendous opportunity, because it is something that can be changed, and it is something that can be changed immediately, and it could be used as a simple 'lever' to help bring the entire patriarchy tumbling down.

So girls should not only be provided with free pads and tampons in schools, and educated about periods, but boys should also be taught about periods, and how to help their sisters, friends, and girlfriends. They should be encouraged to think of it as a duty, and inculcated with a sense of shame if they fail at it. Any instances of period shaming should be dealt with swiftly and severely.

Girls should be taught about their bodies and how to take care of them in health or sex education class, along with boys. So, regardless of what they've been taught at home, the school should aim to ensure that no young woman is startled, or dismayed, if she has her first period at school, and of course , that she has the necessary supplies to deal with it.

 How are they different? They are only different because they are often not provided for free in schools, and they are only used by girls. This is not a coincidence. The reason they aren't provided to girls, is because of the stigma around periods, as expressed by the patriarchy, and represents a form of discrimination against women. It's sexism, plain and simple.

So, this is something that needs to be addressed along with all the other manifestations of patriarchal sexism that are still present in our schools, holding girls down. In this sense, it represents a tremendous opportunity, because it is something that can be changed, and it is something that can be changed immediately, and it could be used as a simple 'lever' to help bring the entire patriarchy tumbling down.

So girls should not only be provided with free pads and tampons in schools, and educated about periods, but boys should also be taught about periods, and how to help their sisters, friends, and girlfriends.

In my opinion, the topic of periods is often still taboo, but it shouldn't be. Girls should be taught about their bodies and how to take care of them in health or sex education class, along with boys. So, regardless of what they've been taught at home, the school should aim to ensure that no young woman is startled, or dismayed, if she has her first period at school, and of course , that she has the necessary supplies to deal with it.

 How are they different? They are only different because they are often not provided for free in schools, and they are only used by girls. This is not a coincidence. The reason they aren't provided to girls, is because of the stigma around periods, as expressed by the patriarchy, and represents a form of discrimination against women. It's sexism, plain and simple.

So, this is something that needs to be addressed along with all the other manifestations of patriarchal sexism that are still present in our schools, holding girls down. In this sense, it represents a tremendous opportunity, because it is something that can be changed, and it is something that can be changed immediately, and it could be used as a simple 'lever' to help bring the entire patriarchy tumbling down.

Girls should be taught about their bodies and how to take care of them in health or sex education class, along with boys. So, regardless of what they've been taught at home, the school should aim to ensure that no young woman is startled, or dismayed, if she has her first period at school, and of course , that she has the necessary supplies to deal with it.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, or Band-Aids? hey are all hygiene products that are necessary ,fat times, or a person's health and well-being.
 How are they different? They are only different because they are often not provided for free in schools, and they are only used by girls. This is not a coincidence. The reason they aren't provided to girls, is because of the stigma around periods, as expressed by the patriarchy, and represents a form of discrimination against women. It's sexism, plain and simple.

So, this is something that needs to be addressed along with all the other manifestations of patriarchal sexism that are still present in our schools, holding girls down. In this sense, it represents a tremendous opportunity, because it is something that can be changed, and it is something that can be changed immediately, and it could be used as a simple 'lever' to help bring the entire patriarchy tumbling down.

So girls should not only be provided with free pads and tampons in schools, and educated about periods, but boys should also be taught about periods, and how to help their sisters, friends, and girlfriends. They should be encouraged to think of it as a duty, and inculcated with a sense of shame if they fail at it. Any instances of period shaming should be dealt with swiftly and severely. If all of these practices are adhered to, period shaming will be a thing of the past, and girls will be able to feel comfortable talking about their periods, and will be able to take care of themselves properly.

In my opinion, the topic of periods is often still taboo, but it shouldn't be. Girls should be taught about their bodies and how to take care of them in health or sex education class, along with boys. So, regardless of what they've been taught at home, the school should aim to ensure that no young woman is startled, or dismayed, if she has her first period at school, and of course , that she has the necessary supplies to deal with it.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, or Band-Aids? hey are all hygiene products that are necessary ,fat times, or a person's health and well-being.
 How are they different? They are only different because they are often not provided for free in schools, and they are only used by girls. This is not a coincidence. The reason they aren't provided to girls, is because of the stigma around periods, as expressed by the patriarchy, and represents a form of discrimination against women. It's sexism, plain and simple.

So, this is something that needs to be addressed along with all the other manifestations of patriarchal sexism that are still present in our schools, holding girls down. In this sense, it represents a tremendous opportunity, because it is something that can be changed, and it is something that can be changed immediately, and it could be used as a simple 'lever' to help bring the entire patriarchy tumbling down.

So girls should not only be provided with free pads and tampons in schools, and educated about periods, but boys should also be taught about periods, and how to help their sisters, friends, and girlfriends.

So, regardless of what they've been taught at home, the school should aim to ensure that no young woman is startled, or dismayed, if she has her first period at school, and of course , that she has the necessary supplies to deal with it.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, or Band-Aids? hey are all hygiene products that are necessary ,fat times, or a person's health and well-being.
 How are they different? They are only different because they are often not provided for free in schools, and they are only used by girls. This is not a coincidence. The reason they aren't provided to girls, is because of the stigma around periods, as expressed by the patriarchy, and represents a form of discrimination against women. It's sexism, plain and simple.

So, this is something that needs to be addressed along with all the other manifestations of patriarchal sexism that are still present in our schools, holding girls down. In this sense, it represents a tremendous opportunity, because it is something that can be changed, and it is something that can be changed immediately, and it could be used as a simple 'lever' to help bring the entire patriarchy tumbling down.

So girls should not only be provided with free pads and tampons in schools, and educated about periods, but boys should also be taught about periods, and how to help their sisters, friends, and girlfriends. They should be encouraged to think of it as a duty, and inculcated with a sense of shame if they fail at it. Any instances of period shaming should be dealt with swiftly and severely. If all of these practices are adhered to, period shaming will be a thing of the past, and girls will be able to feel comfortable talking about their periods, and will be able to take care of themselves properly. Also, boys will receive some much-needed improvement, because they will be able to help their female friends and sisters, and will be more aware of the needs of women in general.

So girls should not only be provided with free pads and tampons in schools, and educated about periods, but boys should also be taught about periods, and how to help their sisters, friends, and girlfriends. They should be encouraged to think of it as a duty, and inculcated with a sense of shame if they fail at it. Any instances of period shaming should be dealt with swiftly and severely. If all of these practices are adhered to, period shaming will be a thing of the past, and girls will be able to feel comfortable talking about their periods, and will be able to take care of themselves properly. Also, boys will receive some much-needed improvement, because they will be able to help their female friends and sisters, and will be more aware of the needs of women in general.

In my opinion, the topic of periods is often still taboo, but it shouldn't be. Girls should be taught about their bodies and how to take care of them in health or sex education class, along with boys. So, regardless of what they've been taught at home, the school should aim to ensure that no young woman is startled, or dismayed, if she has her first period at school, and of course , that she has the necessary supplies to deal with it.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, or Band-Aids? hey are all hygiene products that are necessary ,fat times, or a person's health and well-being.
 How are they different? They are only different because they are often not provided for free in schools, and they are only used by girls. This is not a coincidence. The reason they aren't provided to girls, is because of the stigma around periods, as expressed by the patriarchy, and represents a form of discrimination against women. It's sexism, plain and simple.

So, this is something that needs to be addressed along with all the other manifestations of patriarchal sexism that are still present in our schools, holding girls down. In this sense, it represents a tremendous opportunity, because it is something that can be changed, and it is something that can be changed immediately, and it could be used as a simple 'lever' to help bring the entire patriarchy tumbling down.

So girls should not only be provided with free pads and tampons in schools, and educated about periods, but boys should also be taught about periods, and how to help their sisters, friends, and girlfriends. They should be encouraged to think of it as a duty, and inculcated with a sense of shame if they fail at it. Any instances of period shaming should be dealt with swiftly and severely. If all of these practices are adhered to, period shaming will be a thing of the past, and girls will be able to feel comfortable talking about their periods, and will be able to take care of themselves properly.

So, regardless of what they've been taught at home, the school should aim to ensure that no young woman is startled, or dismayed, if she has her first period at school, and of course , that she has the necessary supplies to deal with it.

 How are they different? They are only different because they are often not provided for free in schools, and they are only used by girls. This is not a coincidence. The reason they aren't provided to girls, is because of the stigma around periods, as expressed by the patriarchy, and represents a form of discrimination against women. It's sexism, plain and simple.

So, this is something that needs to be addressed along with all the other manifestations of patriarchal sexism that are still present in our schools, holding girls down. In this sense, it represents a tremendous opportunity, because it is something that can be changed, and it is something that can be changed immediately, and it could be used as a simple 'lever' to help bring the entire patriarchy tumbling down.

So girls should not only be provided with free pads and tampons in schools, and educated about periods, but boys should also be taught about periods, and how to help their sisters, friends, and girlfriends. They should be encouraged to think of it as a duty, and inculcated with a sense of shame if they fail at it. Any instances of period shaming should be dealt with swiftly and severely. If all of these practices are adhered to, period shaming will be a thing of the past, and girls will be able to feel comfortable talking about their periods, and will be able to take care of themselves properly. Also, boys will receive some much-needed improvement, because they will be able to help their female friends and sisters, and will be more aware of the needs of women in general.

The reason they aren't provided to girls, is because of the stigma around periods, as expressed by the patriarchy, and represents a form of discrimination against women. It's sexism, plain and simple.

So, this is something that needs to be addressed along with all the other manifestations of patriarchal sexism that are still present in our schools, holding girls down. In this sense, it represents a tremendous opportunity, because it is something that can be changed, and it is something that can be changed immediately, and it could be used as a simple 'lever' to help bring the entire patriarchy tumbling down.

So girls should not only be provided with free pads and tampons in schools, and educated about periods, but boys should also be taught about periods, and how to help their sisters, friends, and girlfriends. They should be encouraged to think of it as a duty, and inculcated with a sense of shame if they fail at it. Any instances of period shaming should be dealt with swiftly and severely. If all of these practices are adhered to, period shaming will be a thing of the past, and girls will be able to feel comfortable talking about their periods, and will be able to take care of themselves properly. Also, boys will receive some much-needed improvement, because they will be able to help their female friends and sisters, and will be more aware of the needs of women in general.

In my opinion, the topic of periods is often still taboo, but it shouldn't be. Girls should be taught about their bodies and how to take care of them in health or sex education class, along with boys. So, regardless of what they've been taught at home, the school should aim to ensure that no young woman is startled, or dismayed, if she has her first period at school, and of course , that she has the necessary supplies to deal with it.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, or Band-Aids? hey are all hygiene products that are necessary ,fat times, or a person's health and well-being.
 How are they different? They are only different because they are often not provided for free in schools, and they are only used by girls. This is not a coincidence. The reason they aren't provided to girls, is because of the stigma around periods, as expressed by the patriarchy, and represents a form of discrimination against women. It's sexism, plain and simple.

So, this is something that needs to be addressed along with all the other manifestations of patriarchal sexism that are still present in our schools, holding girls down. In this sense, it represents a tremendous opportunity, because it is something that can be changed, and it is something that can be changed immediately, and it could be used as a simple 'lever' to help bring the entire patriarchy tumbling down.

So girls should not only be provided with free pads and tampons in schools, and educated about periods, but boys should also be taught about periods, and how to help their sisters, friends, and girlfriends. They should be encouraged to think of it as a duty, and inculcated with a sense of shame if they fail at it. Any instances of period shaming should be dealt with swiftly and severely. If all of these practices are adhered to, period shaming will be a thing of the past, and girls will be able to feel comfortable talking about their periods, and will be able to take care of themselves properly. Also, boys will receive some much-needed improvement, because they will be able to help their female friends and sisters, and will be more aware of the needs of women in general.

In my opinion, the topic of periods is often still taboo, but it shouldn't be. Girls should be taught about their bodies and how to take care of them in health or sex education class, along with boys.

 How are they different? They are only different because they are often not provided for free in schools, and they are only used by girls. This is not a coincidence. The reason they aren't provided to girls, is because of the stigma around periods, as expressed by the patriarchy, and represents a form of discrimination against women. It's sexism, plain and simple.

So, this is something that needs to be addressed along with all the other manifestations of patriarchal sexism that are still present in our schools, holding girls down. In this sense, it represents a tremendous opportunity, because it is something that can be changed, and it is something that can be changed immediately, and it could be used as a simple 'lever' to help bring the entire patriarchy tumbling down.

So girls should not only be provided with free pads and tampons in schools, and educated about periods, but boys should also be taught about periods, and how to help their sisters, friends, and girlfriends.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, the topic of periods is often still taboo, but it shouldn't be. Girls should be taught about their bodies and how to take care of them in health or sex education class, along with boys. So, regardless of what they've been taught at home, the school should aim to ensure that no young woman is startled, or dismayed, if she has her first period at school, and of course , that she has the necessary supplies to deal with it.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, or Band-Aids? hey are all hygiene products that are necessary ,fat times, or a person's health and well-being.
 How are they different? They are only different because they are often not provided for free in schools, and they are only used by girls. This is not a coincidence. The reason they aren't provided to girls, is because of the stigma around periods, as expressed by the patriarchy, and represents a form of discrimination against women. It's sexism, plain and simple.

So, this is something that needs to be addressed along with all the other manifestations of patriarchal sexism that are still present in our schools, holding girls down. In this sense, it represents a tremendous opportunity, because it is something that can be changed, and it is something that can be changed immediately, and it could be used as a simple 'lever' to help bring the entire patriarchy tumbling down.

So girls should not only be provided with free pads and tampons in schools, and educated about periods, but boys should also be taught about periods, and how to help their sisters, friends, and girlfriends. They should be encouraged to think of it as a duty, and inculcated with a sense of shame if they fail at it. Any instances of period shaming should be dealt with swiftly and severely. If all of these practices are adhered to, period shaming will be a thing of the past, and girls will be able to feel comfortable talking about their periods, and will be able to take care of themselves properly. Also, boys will receive some much-needed improvement, because they will be able to help their female friends and sisters, and will be more aware of the needs of women in general.
