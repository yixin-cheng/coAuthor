In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really a",1368,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,948

I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their he",1410,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,992

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics.

People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics. An online dating forum gives people an opportunity to daydream and be unrealistic about themselves and then in turn be unrealistic in their requirements for others.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics. An online dating forum gives people an opportunity to daydream and be unrealistic about themselves and then in turn be unrealistic in their requirements for others.

When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics. An online dating forum gives people an opportunity to daydream and be unrealistic about themselves and then in turn be unrealistic in their requirements for others.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics. An online dating forum gives people an opportunity to daydream and be unrealistic about themselves and then in turn be unrealistic in their requirements for others.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics. An online dating forum gives people an opportunity to daydream and be unrealistic about themselves and then in turn be unrealistic in their requirements for others.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics. An online dating forum gives people an opportunity to daydream and be unrealistic about themselves and then in turn be unrealistic in their requirements for others.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics. An online dating forum gives people an opportunity to daydream and be unrealistic about themselves and then in turn be unrealistic in their requirements for others. 
n my opinion, technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics. An online dating forum gives people an opportunity to daydream and be unrealistic about themselves and then in turn be unrealistic in their requirements for others.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics. An online dating forum gives people an opportunity to daydream and be unrealistic about themselves and then in turn be unrealistic in their requirements for others.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics. An online dating forum gives people an opportunity to daydream and be unrealistic about themselves and then in turn be unrealistic in their requirements for others. 
n my opinion, technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 It is best that people try to meet people in a more natural and realistic setting where others can see you for what you really are instead of some made up mental image that is not real.

When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics. An online dating forum gives people an opportunity to daydream and be unrealistic about themselves and then in turn be unrealistic in their requirements for others. 
n my opinion, technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 It is best that people try to meet people in a more natural and realistic setting where others can see you for what you really are instead of some made up mental image that is not real.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics. An online dating forum gives people an opportunity to daydream and be unrealistic about themselves and then in turn be unrealistic in their requirements for others. 
n my opinion, technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 It is best that people try to meet people in a more natural and realistic setting where others can see you for what you really are instead of some made up mental image that is not real. When a relationship begins in a more natural environment then it is the result of honesty and reality and it has a better chance of succeeding and building a future.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics. An online dating forum gives people an opportunity to daydream and be unrealistic about themselves and then in turn be unrealistic in their requirements for others.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics. An online dating forum gives people an opportunity to daydream and be unrealistic about themselves and then in turn be unrealistic in their requirements for others. 
n my opinion, technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 It is best that people try to meet people in a more natural and realistic setting where others can see you for what you really are instead of some made up mental image that is not real. When a relationship begins in a more natural environment then it is the result of honesty and reality and it has a better chance of succeeding and building a future.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics. An online dating forum gives people an opportunity to daydream and be unrealistic about themselves and then in turn be unrealistic in their requirements for others.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics. An online dating forum gives people an opportunity to daydream and be unrealistic about themselves and then in turn be unrealistic in their requirements for others.

 It is best that people try to meet people in a more natural and realistic setting where others can see you for what you really are instead of some made up mental image that is not real.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics. An online dating forum gives people an opportunity to daydream and be unrealistic about themselves and then in turn be unrealistic in their requirements for others. 
n my opinion, technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 It is best that people try to meet people in a more natural and realistic setting where others can see you for what you really are instead of some made up mental image that is not real. When a relationship begins in a more natural environment then it is the result of honesty and reality and it has a better chance of succeeding and building a future. When a relationship begins as a result of an online dating site, be prepared for lies, disappointment and an unrealistic outcome that is most likely not as described.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics. An online dating forum gives people an opportunity to daydream and be unrealistic about themselves and then in turn be unrealistic in their requirements for others. 
n my opinion, technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 It is best that people try to meet people in a more natural and realistic setting where others can see you for what you really are instead of some made up mental image that is not real. When a relationship begins in a more natural environment then it is the result of honesty and reality and it has a better chance of succeeding and building a future.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics. An online dating forum gives people an opportunity to daydream and be unrealistic about themselves and then in turn be unrealistic in their requirements for others. 
n my opinion, technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 It is best that people try to meet people in a more natural and realistic setting where others can see you for what you really are instead of some made up mental image that is not real.
