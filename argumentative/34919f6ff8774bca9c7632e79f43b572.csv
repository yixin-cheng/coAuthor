In my opinion, I would have to agree with the above premise.  I think it would have a select few of these ultra athletes that every college wants and will pay top dollar for. This could wrong for a number of reasons.

In my opinion, I would have to agree with the above premise.  I think it would have a select few of these ultra athletes that every college wants and will pay top dollar for.

In my opinion, I would have to agree with the above premise.  I think it would have a select few of these ultra athletes that every college wants and will pay top dollar for. This could wrong for a number of reasons. Young adults should not have high amounts of wealth and status because it will demotivate them in the future to pursue more in their sport or educational field. This could also be a problem because it would cause a lot of jealousy and envy amongst the other players. The top players would be praised with promotions and sky high contracts while the rest of the football players are depending on scholarships and their grades to keep them playing. I think it would also give a huge edge to the universities that have the most money to spend on players, giving them more victories, more praise and eventually more money to buy better player.

In my opinion, I would have to agree with the above premise.  I think it would have a select few of these ultra athletes that every college wants and will pay top dollar for. This could wrong for a number of reasons. Young adults should not have high amounts of wealth and status because it will demotivate them in the future to pursue more in their sport or educational field.

In my opinion, I would have to agree with the above premise.  I think it would have a select few of these ultra athletes that every college wants and will pay top dollar for. This could wrong for a number of reasons. Young adults should not have high amounts of wealth and status because it will demotivate them in the future to pursue more in their sport or educational field.

The top players would be praised with promotions and sky high contracts while the rest of the football players are depending on scholarships and their grades to keep them playing. I think it would also give a huge edge to the universities that have the most money to spend on players, giving them more victories, more praise and eventually more money to buy better player.

In my opinion, I would have to agree with the above premise.  I think it would have a select few of these ultra athletes that every college wants and will pay top dollar for. This could wrong for a number of reasons. Young adults should not have high amounts of wealth and status because it will demotivate them in the future to pursue more in their sport or educational field.

In my opinion, I would have to agree with the above premise.  I think it would have a select few of these ultra athletes that every college wants and will pay top dollar for. This could wrong for a number of reasons. Young adults should not have high amounts of wealth and status because it will demotivate them in the future to pursue more in their sport or educational field. This could also be a problem because it would cause a lot of jealousy and envy amongst the other players. The top players would be praised with promotions and sky high contracts while the rest of the football players are depending on scholarships and their grades to keep them playing. I think it would also give a huge edge to the universities that have the most money to spend on players, giving them more victories, more praise and eventually more money to buy better player. The cycle goes on. So in conclusion, no, college players should not be paid for their time for numerous reasons, almost all being negative.

In my opinion, I would have to agree with the above premise.  I think it would have a select few of these ultra athletes that every college wants and will pay top dollar for. This could wrong for a number of reasons. Young adults should not have high amounts of wealth and status because it will demotivate them in the future to pursue more in their sport or educational field. This could also be a problem because it would cause a lot of jealousy and envy amongst the other players. The top players would be praised with promotions and sky high contracts while the rest of the football players are depending on scholarships and their grades to keep them playing. I think it would also give a huge edge to the universities that have the most money to spend on players, giving them more victories, more praise and eventually more money to buy better player. The cycle goes on. So in conclusion, no, college players should not be paid for their time for numerous reasons, almost all being negative.

In my opinion, I would have to agree with the above premise.  I think it would cause hava select few of these ultra athletes that every college wants and will pay top dollar for. This could wrong for a number of reasons. Young adults should not have high amounts of wealth and status because it will demotivate them in the future to pursue more in their sport or educational field. This could also be a problem because it would cause a lot of jealousy and envy amongst the other players. The top players would be praised with promotions and sky high contracts while the rest of the football players are depending on scholarships and their grades to keep them playing. I think it would also give a huge edge to the universities that have the most money to spend on players, giving them more victories, more praise and eventually more money to buy better player. The cycle goes on. So in conclusion, no, college players should not be paid for their time for numerous reasons, almost all being negative.

In my opinion, I would have to agree with the above premise.  I think it would cause a select few of these ultra athletes to be hunted. This could wrong for a number of reasons. Young adults should not have high amounts of wealth and status because it will demotivate them in the future to pursue more in their sport or educational field.
