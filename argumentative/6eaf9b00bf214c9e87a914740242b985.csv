We're not going back to the way things were before so its best to embrace and make the best of it that we can. o let's get positive!
 Lets focus on how to make the experience a better one. That's realistic at least. Lets focus on how to improve what we get out of screen time rather than unrealistically trying to limit screen time. 
So how do we get the most from screen time to our benefit?
 We just look at our daily activities and figure out ways to put a positive spin on them. For example. maybe you use the internet to look for upcoming movies. Try looking for documentaries instead that can help you learn something new. Maybe you are looking for a new restaurant. Instead you could find a new recipe to make. o, figure out what you are doing on your screen and make it work for you.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, it’s time to stop worrying about screen time. The world was already changing and with the pandemic we've reached a point of no return. This is the new reality, and we need to learn how to live, work and play in increasingly more social, increasingly more digital environments.

We're not going back to the way things were before so its best to embrace and make the best of it that we can. o let's get positive!
 Lets focus on how to make the experience a better one. That's realistic at least. Lets focus on how to improve what we get out of screen time rather than unrealistically trying to limit screen time. 
So how do we get the most from screen time to our benefit?
 We just look at our daily activities and figure out ways to put a positive spin on them. For example. maybe you use the internet to look for upcoming movies. Try looking for documentaries instead that can help you learn something new. Maybe you are looking for a new restaurant. Instead you could find a new recipe to make. o, figure out what you are doing on your screen and make it work for you.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, it’s time to stop worrying about screen time. The world was already changing and with the pandemic we've reached a point of no return. This is the new reality, and we need to learn how to live, work and play in increasingly more social, increasingly more digital environments.

We're not going back to the way things were before so its best to embrace and make the best of it that we can. o let's get positive!
 Lets focus on how to make the experience a better one. That's realistic at least. Lets focus on how to improve what we get out of screen time rather than unrealistically trying to limit screen time. 
So how do we get the most from screen time to our benefit?
 We just look at our daily activities and figure out ways to put a positive spin on them. For example. maybe you use the internet to look for upcoming movies. Try looking for documentaries instead that can help you learn something new. Maybe you are looking for a new restaurant. Instead you could find a new recipe to make. o, figure out what you are doing on your screen and make it work for you.
 Turn a time killer into something useful or positive.

We just need to move past the debate of screen time and just develop a realistic mindset of where we are at. So go forth, use your screens and make them work for you.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, it’s time to stop worrying about screen time. The world was already changing and with the pandemic we've reached a point of no return. This is the new reality, and we need to learn how to live, work and play in increasingly more social, increasingly more digital environments.

We're not going back to the way things were before so its best to embrace and make the best of it that we can. o let's get positive!
 Lets focus on how to make the experience a better one. That's realistic at least. Lets focus on how to improve what we get out of screen time rather than unrealistically trying to limit screen time. 
So how do we get the most from screen time to our benefit?
 We just look at our daily activities and figure out ways to put a positive spin on them. For example. maybe you use the internet to look for upcoming movies. Try looking for documentaries instead that can help you learn something new. Maybe you are looking for a new restaurant. Instead you could find a new recipe to make. o, figure out what you are doing on your screen and make it work for you.
 Turn a time killer into something useful or positive.

We just need to move past the debate of screen time and just develop a realistic mindset of where we are at. So go forth, use your screens and make them work for you.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, it’s time to stop worrying about screen time. The world was already changing and with the pandemic we've reached a point of no return. This is the new reality, and we need to learn how to live, work and play in increasingly more social, increasingly more digital environments.

We're not going back to the way things were before so its best to embrace and make the best of it that we can. o let's get positive!
 Lets focus on how to make the experience a better one. That's realistic at least. Lets focus on how to improve what we get out of screen time rather than unrealistically trying to limit screen time. 
So how do we get the most from screen time to our benefit?
 We just look at our daily activities and figure out ways to put a positive spin on them. For example. maybe you use the internet to look for upcoming movies. Try looking for documentaries instead that can help you learn something new. Maybe you are looking for a new restaurant. Instead you could find a new recipe to make. o, figure out what you are doing on your screen and make it work for you.
 Turn a time killer into something useful or positive.

We just need to move past the debate of screen time and just develop a realistic mindset of where we are at. o go forth, use your screens and make them work for you.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, it’s time to stop worrying about screen time. The world was already changing and with the pandemic we've reached a point of no return. This is the new reality, and we need to learn how to live, work and play in increasingly more social, increasingly more digital environments.

We're not going back to the way things were before so its best to embrace and make the best of it that we can. o let's get positive!
 Lets focus on how to make the experience a better one. That's realistic at least. Lets focus on how to improve what we get out of screen time rather than unrealistically trying to limit screen time. 
So how do we get the most from screen time to our benefit?
 We just look at our daily activities and figure out ways to put a positive spin on them. For example. maybe you use the internet to look for upcoming movies. Try looking for documentaries instead that can help you learn something new. Maybe you are looking for a new restaurant. Instead you could find a new recipe to make. o, figure out what you are doing on your screen and make it work for you.
 Turn a time killer into something useful or positive.

We just need to move past the debate of screen time and just develop a realistic mindset of where we are at. o go forth, use your screens and make them work for you.
