In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel.

I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel.

In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel. 
I know that humans are suffering and I do think we should care about that. However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both. So no, the amount of human suffering that exists does not make it wrong to focus on animal welfare.

Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel. 
I know that humans are suffering and I do think we should care about that. However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both. So no, the amount of human suffering that exists does not make it wrong to focus on animal welfare.

In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel. 
I know that humans are suffering and I do think we should care about that. However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both. So no, the amount of human suffering that exists does not make it wrong to focus on animal welfare.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel. 
I know that humans are suffering and I do think we should care about that. However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both. So no, the amount of human suffering that exists does not make it wrong to focus on animal welfare.

Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel. 
I know that humans are suffering and I do think we should care about that. However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both. So no, the amount of human suffering that exists does not make it wrong to focus on animal welfare.

In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel.

In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel. 
I know that humans are suffering and I do think we should care about that. However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both. So no, the amount of human suffering that exists does not make it wrong to focus on animal welfare.

In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel. 
I know that humans are suffering and I do think we should care about that. However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both. So no, the amount of human suffering that exists does not make it wrong to focus on animal welfare.

In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel.

However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel. 
I know that humans are suffering and I do think we should care about that. However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both. So no, the amount of human suffering that exists does not make it wrong to focus on animal welfare.

In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel. 
I know that humans are suffering and I do think we should care about that. However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both. So no, the amount of human suffering that exists does not make it wrong to focus on animal welfare.

In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel. 
I know that humans are suffering and I do think we should care about that. However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both. So no, the amount of human suffering that exists does not make it wrong to focus on animal welfare.

Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel.

In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel.

In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel.

Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel. 
I know that humans are suffering and I do think we should care about that. However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both. So no, the amount of human suffering that exists does not make it wrong to focus on animal welfare.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel. 
I know that humans are suffering and I do think we should care about that. However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both. So no, the amount of human suffering that exists does not make it wrong to focus on animal welfare.

In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel.

In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel. 
I know that humans are suffering and I do think we should care about that. However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both. So no, the amount of human suffering that exists does not make it wrong to focus on animal welfare.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel. 
I know that humans are suffering and I do think we should care about that. However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both. So no, the amount of human suffering that exists does not make it wrong to focus on animal welfare. 
If a person has been harmed by another person a lot in his or her life then I can imagine how their trusted animal companion would be held in a higher regard than a person, who they know might actually hurt them. Some people wrongly think that many people are a threat because of thing they have experienced. For them to care more about animals isn't wrong.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel. 
I know that humans are suffering and I do think we should care about that. However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both. So no, the amount of human suffering that exists does not make it wrong to focus on animal welfare.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel. 
I know that humans are suffering and I do think we should care about that. However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both. So no, the amount of human suffering that exists does not make it wrong to focus on animal welfare. 
If a person has been harmed by another person a lot in his or her life then I can imagine how their trusted animal companion would be held in a higher regard than a person, who they know might actually hurt them. Some people wrongly think that many people are a threat because of thing they have experienced. For them to care more about animals isn't wrong.

In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel. 
I know that humans are suffering and I do think we should care about that. However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both. So no, the amount of human suffering that exists does not make it wrong to focus on animal welfare. 
If a person has been harmed by another person a lot in his or her life then I can imagine how their trusted animal companion would be held in a higher regard than a person, who they know might actually hurt them. Some people wrongly think that many people are a threat because of thing they have experienced. For them to care more about animals isn't wrong.

In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel. 
I know that humans are suffering and I do think we should care about that. However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both. So no, the amount of human suffering that exists does not make it wrong to focus on animal welfare. 
If a person has been harmed by another person a lot in his or her life then I can imagine how their trusted animal companion would be held in a higher regard than a person, who they know might actually hurt them.

In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel. 
I know that humans are suffering and I do think we should care about that. However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both. So no, the amount of human suffering that exists does not make it wrong to focus on animal welfare. 
If a person has been harmed by another person a lot in his or her life then I can imagine how their trusted animal companion would be held in a higher regard than a person, who they know might actually hurt them. Some people wrongly think that many people are a threat because of thing they have experienced. For them to care more about animals isn't wrong.

Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel. 
I know that humans are suffering and I do think we should care about that. However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both. So no, the amount of human suffering that exists does not make it wrong to focus on animal welfare. 
If a person has been harmed by another person a lot in his or her life then I can imagine how their trusted animal companion would be held in a higher regard than a person, who they know might actually hurt them. Some people wrongly think that many people are a threat because of thing they have experienced. For them to care more about animals isn't wrong. 
There are many explanations for why it's NOT wrong to focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer, but most importantly if people don't even care ",1930,[],2,2,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1757

In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel. 
I know that humans are suffering and I do think we should care about that. However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both. So no, the amount of human suffering that exists does not make it wrong to focus on animal welfare. 
If a person has been harmed by another person a lot in his or her life then I can imagine how their trusted animal companion would be held in a higher regard than a person, who they know might actually hurt them. Some people wrongly think that many people are a threat because of thing they have experienced. For them to care more about animals isn't wrong.
