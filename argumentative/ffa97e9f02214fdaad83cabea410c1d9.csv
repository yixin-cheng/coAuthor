In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are used to make a point. A good example is horror movies. They like to amplify characters traits because there isn't enough time for complex character development. Because of that you end up with a movie filled with stereotypes. You have the jock, the slutty one, the brain, racial stereotype and sometimes the flamboyant gay person who makes jokes. They are all written to fill a specific part of the horror movie. We're used to that formula though so I feel from a society standpoint that such roles are okay in that genre. 

It can be okay sometimes to have stereotypes. The characters must be at least funny or have something about them that makes them charming or likable. Then you can look past these shortcomings. If they are just flat characters then it makes it hard to be able to do that.

We're used to that formula though so I feel from a society standpoint that such roles are okay in that genre.

You have the jock, the slutty one, the brain, racial stereotype and sometimes the flamboyant gay person who makes jokes. They are all written to fill a specific part of the horror movie. We're used to that formula though so I feel from a society standpoint that such roles are okay in that genre.

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are used to make a point. A good example is horror movies. They like to amplify characters traits because there isn't enough time for complex character development. Because of that you end up with a movie filled with stereotypes. You have the jock, the slutty one, the brain, racial stereotype and sometimes the flamboyant gay person who makes jokes. They are all written to fill a specific part of the horror movie. We're used to that formula though so I feel from a society standpoint that such roles are okay in that genre. 

It can be okay sometimes to have stereotypes. The characters must be at least funny or have something about them that makes them charming or likable. Then you can look past these shortcomings. If they are just flat characters then it makes it hard to be able to do that. 

Media has evolved when it comes to portraying stereotypes. Remakes are being done where once weak female characters are now tougher for example. Even the infamous Psycho death scene was changed for the show Bates Motel. The iconic female victim switched to a male victim in the shower.

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are used to make a point. A good example is horror movies. They like to amplify characters traits because there isn't enough time for complex character development. Because of that you end up with a movie filled with stereotypes. You have the jock, the slutty one, the brain, racial stereotype and sometimes the flamboyant gay person who makes jokes. They are all written to fill a specific part of the horror movie. We're used to that formula though so I feel from a society standpoint that such roles are okay in that genre. 

It can be okay sometimes to have stereotypes. The characters must be at least funny or have something about them that makes them charming or likable. Then you can look past these shortcomings. If they are just flat characters then it makes it hard to be able to do that.

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are used to make a point. A good example is horror movies. They like to amplify characters traits because there isn't enough time for complex character development. Because of that you end up with a movie filled with stereotypes. You have the jock, the slutty one, the brain, racial stereotype and sometimes the flamboyant gay person who makes jokes. They are all written to fill a specific part of the horror movie. We're used to that formula though so I feel from a society standpoint that such roles are okay in that genre. 

It can be okay sometimes to have stereotypes. The characters must be at least funny or have something about them that makes them charming or likable. Then you can look past these shortcomings. If they are just flat characters then it makes it hard to be able to do that. 

Media has evolved when it comes to portraying stereotypes. Remakes are being done where once weak female characters are now tougher. For example. Even the infamous Psycho death scene was changed for the show Bates Motel. The iconic female victim switched to a male victim in the shower. 

I personally don't have a problem with stereotypes. Sometimes I may cringe when I see them but that's part of it. Characters are getting written with more depth these days so it's becoming less of an issue. ",1250,[],0,4,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1812
