In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school.

I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not.

Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less.

I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school.

This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less.

I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school.

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school.

This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not.

School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athelete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance",2271,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1318

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athelete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance. Also, paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.",2387,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1332

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.

This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not.

Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better.

This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.

Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.
BI think a scholarship is adequet because it'll give the chance at a college education to some people who may not have had that chance to begin with whether it be due to their grades or their financial situaiton at home. 

Its also not necessary to pay the athletes because most of the ones that would get paid and are big money makers for the school, will probably end up being a pro and get paid once they graduate. They can look at their college ""caree",2837,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1867

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school.

This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school.

Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.
BI think a scholarship is adequet because it'll give the chance at a college education to some people who may not have had that chance to begin with whether it be due to their grades or their financial situaiton at home.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.
BI think a scholarship is adequate because it'll give the chance at a college education to some people who may not have had that chance to begin with whether it be due to their grades or their financial situaiton at home. 

Its also not necessary to pay the athletes because most of the ones that would get paid and are big money makers for the school, will probably end up being a pro and get paid once they graduate. They can look at their college ""career"" as training for their pro career. 
College athletes don't need to be paid, it's not part of the job description, they are already receiving a free college education.

Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.
BI think a scholarship is adequate because it'll give the chance at a college education to some people who may not have had that chance to begin with whether it be due to their grades or their financial situation at home. 

Its also not necessary to pay the athletes because most of the ones that would get paid and are big money makers for the school, will probably end up being a pro and get paid once they graduate. They can look at their college ""career"" as training for their pro career.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school.

This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets.
