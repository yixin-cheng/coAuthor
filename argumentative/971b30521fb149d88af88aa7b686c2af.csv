In my opinion, sports involve certain degree of danger, so no sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. But I admit that there are lines which should be drawn. Sports should only be played with the consent of every participant; players should have their physical and psychological states tested and certified by qualified specialists. In addition, if there is the possibility of serious injury, insurance should be provided and equipment should be maintained to minimize any harm. In most cases, these suggested conditions have been met satisfactorily, so I don't think that any sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. ports should also be conducted freely so that the players will have a sense of freedom.
