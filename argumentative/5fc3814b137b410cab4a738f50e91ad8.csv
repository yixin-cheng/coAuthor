Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world.

So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son?

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything.""

Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son?

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler.

I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler.

After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention.

I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 


In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son?

Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention.

Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family.

After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world.

So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York?

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.

All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York?

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world.

For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler.

In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news.

So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example.

So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.

The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example.

Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen.

For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son?

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family.

For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. Th",3346,[],1,1,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1059

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son?

So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That means ",3355,[],1,1,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1068

Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed.

It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention.

So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.

So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home.

I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home.

All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen.

She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything.

That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities.

 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family.

For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example.

She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son?

I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home.

 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen.

I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life.""

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life.""

Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home.

The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I ",4111,[],2,2,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1245

And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know",4118,[],2,2,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1252

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life.""

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life.""

The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's imp",4132,[],0,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1274

For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it.

So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it.

So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it.

For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's important for me to show up at the animal shelter on Sunday morning to groom the dogs just in case the volunteers are sick, for example.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's important for me to show up at the animal shelter on Sunday morning to groom the dogs just in case the volunteers are sick, for example.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's important for me to show up at the animal shelter on Sunday morning to groom the dogs just in case the volunteers are sick, for example.

I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's important for me to show up at the animal shelter on Sunday morning to groom the dogs just in case the volunteers are sick, for example.

Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's important for me to show up at the animal shelter on Sunday morning to groom the dogs just in case the volunteers are sick, for example.

So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's important for me to show up at the animal shelter on Sunday morning to groom the dogs just in case the volunteers are sick, for example.

All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's important for me to show up at the animal shelter on Sunday morning to groom the dogs just in case the volunteers are sick, for example.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine?

I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's important for me to show up at the animal shelter on Sunday morning to groom the dogs just in case the volunteers are sick, for example.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son?

For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's important for me to show up at the animal shelter on Sunday morning to groom the dogs just in case the volunteers are sick, for example.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son?

So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's important for me to show up at the animal shelter on Sunday morning to groom the dogs just in case the volunteers are sick, for example.

The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's important for me to show up at the animal shelter on Sunday morning to groom the dogs just in case the volunteers are sick, for example. So there are definitely ways to give back to my community and be a good citizen without having to know every single thing that's happening in the world. Fr",4421,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1416

Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's important for me to show up at the animal shelter on Sunday morning to groom the dogs just in case the volunteers are sick, for example. So there are definitely ways to give back to my community and be a good citizen without having to know every single thing that's happening in the world. Frankly, ",4428,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1423

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's important for me to show up at the animal shelter on Sunday morning to groom the dogs just in case the volunteers are sick, for example.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example.

It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's important for me to show up at the animal shelter on Sunday morning to groom the dogs just in case the volunteers are sick, for example. So there are definitely ways to give back to my community and be a good citizen without having to know every single thing that's happening in the world.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news.

All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's important for me to show up at the animal shelter on Sunday morning to groom the dogs just in case the volunteers are sick, for example. So there are definitely ways to give back to my community and be a good citizen without having to know every single thing that's happening in the world. Frankly, I'm shocked that people even worry about what Madonna is doing. W",4493,[],3,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1457

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine?

Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's important for me to show up at the animal shelter on Sunday morning to groom the dogs just in case the volunteers are sick, for example. So there are definitely ways to give back to my community and be a good citizen without having to know every single thing that's happening in the world. Frankly, I'm shocked that people even worry about what Madonna is doing. Why shou",4500,[],3,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1464

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else.

So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's important for me to show up at the animal shelter on Sunday morning to groom the dogs just in case the volunteers are sick, for example. So there are definitely ways to give back to my community and be a good citizen without having to know every single thing that's happening in the world.

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's important for me to show up at the animal shelter on Sunday morning to groom the dogs just in case the volunteers are sick, for example. So there are definitely ways to give back to my community and be a good citizen without having to know every single thing that's happening in the world. Frankly, I'm shocked that people even worry about what Madonna is doing. Why should I spend my time reading about her superstar gossip when I have a job and a family to worry about?

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen.

So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's important for me to show up at the animal shelter on Sunday morning to groom the dogs just in case the volunteers are sick, for example. So there are definitely ways to give back to my community and be a good citizen without having to know every single thing that's happening in the world. Frankly, I'm shocked that people even worry about what Madonna is doing. Why should I spend my time reading about her superstar gossip when I have a job and a family to worry about?

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it.

In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's important for me to show up at the animal shelter on Sunday morning to groom the dogs just in case the volunteers are sick, for example. So there are definitely ways to give back to my community and be a good citizen without having to know every single thing that's happening in the world. Frankly, I'm shocked that people even worry about what Madonna is doing. Why should I spend my time reading about her superstar gossip when I have a job and a family to worry about?

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's important for me to show up at the animal shelter on Sunday morning to groom the dogs just in case the volunteers are sick, for example.
