Lack of sleep has been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  Additionally, our mental health can be negatively affected.    Our health care workers should be monitoring how the increased screen time is affecting us.

Unfortunately, it looks like more screen time usage will be the norm for the near future.  We are not seeing a decline in COVID-19 cases.   There are school systems that began this year with in-person classes that may be going back to virtual due to the COVID-19 cases.   Some offices are continuing to keep their workers at home.   This is a very bad sign.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we should be worried about excessive screen time during the pandemic.   Staring at electronic screens can have bad effects on our health.  Our eye health can be adversely affected by the increased screen time.  More screen time may cause us to get less sleep.  An adequate amount of sleep is a necessity for our health.   Lack of sleep has been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  Additionally, our mental health can be negatively affected.    Our health care workers should be monitoring how the increased screen time is affecting us.

Unfortunately, it looks like more screen time usage will be the norm for the near future.  We are not seeing a decline in COVID-19 cases.   There are school systems that began this year with in-person classes that may be going back to virtual due to the COVID-19 cases.   Some offices are continuing to keep their workers at home.

In my opinion, we should be worried about excessive screen time during the pandemic.   Staring at electronic screens can have bad effects on our health.  Our eye health can be adversely affected by the increased screen time.  More screen time may cause us to get less sleep.  An adequate amount of sleep is a necessity for our health.   Lack of sleep has been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  Additionally, our mental health can be negatively affected.    Our health care workers should be monitoring how the increased screen time is affecting us.

Unfortunately, it looks like more screen time usage will be the norm for the near future.  We are not seeing a decline in COVID-19 cases.   There are school systems that began this year with in-person classes that may be going back to virtual due to the COVID-19 cases.   Some offices are continuing to keep their workers at home.

Our eye health can be adversely affected by the increased screen time.  More screen time may cause us to get less sleep.  An adequate amount of sleep is a necessity for our health.

Our health care workers should be monitoring how the increased screen time is affecting us.

There are school systems that began this year with in-person classes that may be going back to virtual due to the COVID-19 cases.   Some offices are continuing to keep their workers at home.   This is a very bad sign.

Our health care workers should be monitoring how the increased screen time is affecting us.

In my opinion, we should be worried about excessive screen time during the pandemic.   Staring at electronic screens can have bad effects on our health.  Our eye health can be adversely affected by the increased screen time.  More screen time may cause us to get less sleep.  An adequate amount of sleep is a necessity for our health.

Our health care workers should be monitoring how the increased screen time is affecting us.

Unfortunately, it looks like more screen time usage will be the norm for the near future.  We are not seeing a decline in COVID-19 cases.   There are school systems that began this year with in-person classes that may be going back to virtual due to the COVID-19 cases.   Some offices are continuing to keep their workers at home.

In my opinion, we should be worried about excessive screen time during the pandemic.   Staring at electronic screens can have bad effects on our health.  Our eye health can be adversely affected by the increased screen time.  More screen time may cause us to get less sleep.  An adequate amount of sleep is a necessity for our health.   Lack of sleep has been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  Additionally, our mental health can be negatively affected.    Our health care workers should be monitoring how the increased screen time is affecting us.

Unfortunately, it looks like more screen time usage will be the norm for the near future.  We are not seeing a decline in COVID-19 cases.   There are school systems that began this year with in-person classes that may be going back to virtual due to the COVID-19 cases.   Some offices are continuing to keep their workers at home.

In my opinion, we should be worried about excessive screen time during the pandemic.   Staring at electronic screens can have bad effects on our health.  Our eye health can be adversely affected by the increased screen time.  More screen time may cause us to get less sleep.  An adequate amount of sleep is a necessity for our health.   Lack of sleep has been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  Additionally, our mental health can be negatively affected.    Our health care workers should be monitoring how the increased screen time is affecting us.

Unfortunately, it looks like more screen time usage will be the norm for the near future.  We are not seeing a decline in COVID-19 cases.   There are school systems that began this year with in-person classes that may be going back to virtual due to the COVID-19 cases.   Some offices are continuing to keep their workers at home.

Our eye health can be adversely affected by the increased screen time.  More screen time may cause us to get less sleep.  An adequate amount of sleep is a necessity for our health.   Lack of sleep has been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  Additionally, our mental health can be negatively affected.    Our health care workers should be monitoring how the increased screen time is affecting us.

Unfortunately, it looks like more screen time usage will be the norm for the near future.  We are not seeing a decline in COVID-19 cases.   There are school systems that began this year with in-person classes that may be going back to virtual due to the COVID-19 cases.   Some offices are continuing to keep their workers at home.   This is a very bad sign.

I think it is best to limit the amount of screen time possible.  That maybe hard when it comes to work and school.  However, for entertainment, it is possible to reduce our screen time.  People can focus on outdoor activities instead of staying inside to play video games or watch streaming shows.  People can also choose to r  ",1710,[],0,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1658

In my opinion, we should be worried about excessive screen time during the pandemic.   Staring at electronic screens can have bad effects on our health.  Our eye health can be adversely affected by the increased screen time.  More screen time may cause us to get less sleep.  An adequate amount of sleep is a necessity for our health.   Lack of sleep has been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  Additionally, our mental health can be negatively affected.    Our health care workers should be monitoring how the increased screen time is affecting us.

Unfortunately, it looks like more screen time usage will be the norm for the near future.  We are not seeing a decline in COVID-19 cases.   There are school systems that began this year with in-person classes that may be going back to virtual due to the COVID-19 cases.   Some offices are continuing to keep their workers at home.

In my opinion, we should be worried about excessive screen time during the pandemic.   Staring at electronic screens can have bad effects on our health.  Our eye health can be adversely affected by the increased screen time.  More screen time may cause us to get less sleep.  An adequate amount of sleep is a necessity for our health.

Our health care workers should be monitoring how the increased screen time is affecting us.

This is a very bad sign.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we should be worried about excessive screen time during the pandemic.   Staring at electronic screens can have bad effects on our health.  Our eye health can be adversely affected by the increased screen time.  More screen time may cause us to get less sleep.  An adequate amount of sleep is a necessity for our health.   Lack of sleep has been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  Additionally, our mental health can be negatively affected.    Our health care workers should be monitoring how the increased screen time is affecting us.

Unfortunately, it looks like more screen time usage will be the norm for the near future.  We are not seeing a decline in COVID-19 cases.   There are school systems that began this year with in-person classes that may be going back to virtual due to the COVID-19 cases.   Some offices are continuing to keep their workers at home.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we should be worried about excessive screen time during the pandemic.   Staring at electronic screens can have bad effects on our health.  Our eye health can be adversely affected by the increased screen time.  More screen time may cause us to get less sleep.  An adequate amount of sleep is a necessity for our health.   Lack of sleep has been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  Additionally, our mental health can be negatively affected.    Our health care workers should be monitoring how the increased screen time is affecting us.

Unfortunately, it looks like more screen time usage will be the norm for the near future.  We are not seeing a decline in COVID-19 cases.   There are school systems that began this year with in-person classes that may be going back to virtual due to the COVID-19 cases.   Some offices are continuing to keep their workers at home.

In my opinion, we should be worried about excessive screen time during the pandemic.   Staring at electronic screens can have bad effects on our health.  Our eye health can be adversely affected by the increased screen time.  More screen time may cause us to get less sleep.  An adequate amount of sleep is a necessity for our health.   Lack of sleep has been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  Additionally, our mental health can be negatively affected.    Our health care workers should be monitoring how the increased screen time is affecting us.

Unfortunately, it looks like more screen time usage will be the norm for the near future.  We are not seeing a decline in COVID-19 cases.   There are school systems that began this year with in-person classes that may be going back to virtual due to the COVID-19 cases.   Some offices are continuing to keep their workers at home.

In my opinion, we should be worried about excessive screen time during the pandemic.   Staring at electronic screens can have bad effects on our health.  Our eye health can be adversely affected by the increased screen time.  More screen time may cause us to get less sleep.  An adequate amount of sleep is a necessity for our health.   Lack of sleep has been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  Additionally, our mental health can be negatively affected.    Our health care workers should be monitoring how the increased screen time is affecting us.

Unfortunately, it looks like more screen time usage will be the norm for the near future.  We are not seeing a decline in COVID-19 cases.   There are school systems that began this year with in-person classes that may be going back to virtual due to the COVID-19 cases.   Some offices are continuing to keep their workers at home.   This is a very bad sign.

I think it is best to limit the amount of screen time possible.  That maybe hard when it comes to work and school.  However, for entertainment, it is possible to reduce our screen time.  People can focus on outdoor activities instead of staying inside to play video games or watch streaming shows.  People can also choose to read books instead of staring at their electronic devices.

I think it is best to limit the amount of screen time possible.  That maybe hard when it comes to work and school.  However, for entertainment, it is possible to reduce our screen time.

Our eye health can be adversely affected by the increased screen time.  More screen time may cause us to get less sleep.  An adequate amount of sleep is a necessity for our health.   Lack of sleep has been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  Additionally, our mental health can be negatively affected.    Our health care workers should be monitoring how the increased screen time is affecting us.

Unfortunately, it looks like more screen time usage will be the norm for the near future.  We are not seeing a decline in COVID-19 cases.   There are school systems that began this year with in-person classes that may be going back to virtual due to the COVID-19 cases.   Some offices are continuing to keep their workers at home.   This is a very bad sign.

I think it is best to limit the amount of screen time possible.  That maybe hard when it comes to work and school.  However, for entertainment, it is possible to reduce our screen time.  People can focus on outdoor activities instead of staying inside to play video games or watch streaming shows.  People can also choose to read books instead of staring at their electronic devices.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we should be worried about excessive screen time during the pandemic.   Staring at electronic screens can have bad effects on our health.  Our eye health can be adversely affected by the increased screen time.  More screen time may cause us to get less sleep.  An adequate amount of sleep is a necessity for our health.   Lack of sleep has been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  Additionally, our mental health can be negatively affected.    Our health care workers should be monitoring how the increased screen time is affecting us.

Unfortunately, it looks like more screen time usage will be the norm for the near future.  We are not seeing a decline in COVID-19 cases.   There are school systems that began this year with in-person classes that may be going back to virtual due to the COVID-19 cases.   Some offices are continuing to keep their workers at home.   This is a very bad sign.

I think it is best to limit the amount of screen time possible.  That maybe hard when it comes to work and school.  However, for entertainment, it is possible to reduce our screen time.  People can focus on outdoor activities instead of staying inside to play video games or watch streaming shows.  People can also choose to read books instead of staring at their electronic devices.

In my opinion, we should be worried about excessive screen time during the pandemic.   Staring at electronic screens can have bad effects on our health.  Our eye health can be adversely affected by the increased screen time.  More screen time may cause us to get less sleep.  An adequate amount of sleep is a necessity for our health.   Lack of sleep has been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  Additionally, our mental health can be negatively affected.    Our health care workers should be monitoring how the increased screen time is affecting us.

Unfortunately, it looks like more screen time usage will be the norm for the near future.  We are not seeing a decline in COVID-19 cases.   There are school systems that began this year with in-person classes that may be going back to virtual due to the COVID-19 cases.   Some offices are continuing to keep their workers at home.   This is a very bad sign.

I think it is best to limit the amount of screen time possible.  That maybe hard when it comes to work and school.  However, for entertainment, it is possible to reduce our screen time.  People can focus on outdoor activities instead of staying inside to play video games or watch streaming shows.  People can also choose to read books instead of staring at their electronic devices.

In my opinion, we should be worried about excessive screen time during the pandemic.   Staring at electronic screens can have bad effects on our health.  Our eye health can be adversely affected by the increased screen time.  More screen time may cause us to get less sleep.  An adequate amount of sleep is a necessity for our health.   Lack of sleep has been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  Additionally, our mental health can be negatively affected.    Our health care workers should be monitoring how the increased screen time is affecting us.

Unfortunately, it looks like more screen time usage will be the norm for the near future.  We are not seeing a decline in COVID-19 cases.   There are school systems that began this year with in-person classes that may be going back to virtual due to the COVID-19 cases.   Some offices are continuing to keep their workers at home.

In my opinion, we should be worried about excessive screen time during the pandemic.   Staring at electronic screens can have bad effects on our health.  Our eye health can be adversely affected by the increased screen time.  More screen time may cause us to get less sleep.  An adequate amount of sleep is a necessity for our health.   Lack of sleep has been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  Additionally, our mental health can be negatively affected.    Our health care workers should be monitoring how the increased screen time is affecting us.

Unfortunately, it looks like more screen time usage will be the norm for the near future.  We are not seeing a decline in COVID-19 cases.   There are school systems that began this year with in-person classes that may be going back to virtual due to the COVID-19 cases.   Some offices are continuing to keep their workers at home.   This is a very bad sign.

I think it is best to limit the amount of screen time possible.  That maybe hard when it comes to work and school.  However, for entertainment, it is possible to reduce our screen time.  People can focus on outdoor activities instead of staying inside to play video games or watch streaming shows.  People can also choose to read books instead of staring at their electronic devices.
