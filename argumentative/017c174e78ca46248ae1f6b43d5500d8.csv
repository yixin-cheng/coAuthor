In my opinion, I think they should be provided as needed. It’s a reality that girls go through “that time of the month.” Hygiene products are a basic need. It’s a fact of life. Some families provide them for adolescents. Some families don't for a variety of reasons. Sometimes families are too poor and can't afford to buy feminine hygiene products.

In my opinion, I think they should be provided as needed. It’s a reality that girls go through “that time of the month.” Hygiene products are a basic need. It’s a fact of life. Some families provide them for adolescents. Some families don't for a variety of reasons. Sometimes families are too poor and can't afford to buy feminine hygiene products. Some families are neglectful and simply don't make it a priority to provide these products. It would be a shame for a student to be in school and not have a pad or tampon when it is needed. So, it's up to schools to be prepared.

Every school should have a plan. Just like they have a plan if a student falls and needs ice for her knee, or a band-aid or if there’s an emergency, there should be a plan if someone needs a feminine hygiene product.

In my opinion, I think they should be provided as needed. It’s a reality that girls go through “that time of the month.” Hygiene products are a basic need. It’s a fact of life. Some families provide them for adolescents. Some families don't for a variety of reasons. Sometimes families are too poor and can't afford to buy feminine hygiene products. Some families are neglectful and simply don't make it a priority to provide these products. It would be a shame for a student to be in school and not have a pad or tampon when it is needed. So, it's up to schools to be prepared.

Every school should have a plan.

Some families provide them for adolescents. Some families don't for a variety of reasons. Sometimes families are too poor and can't afford to buy feminine hygiene products. Some families are neglectful and simply don't make it a priority to provide these products. It would be a shame for a student to be in school and not have a pad or tampon when it is needed. So, it's up to schools to be prepared.

Every school should have a plan. Just like they have a plan if a student falls and needs ice for her knee, or a band-aid or if there’s an emergency, there should be a plan if someone needs a feminine hygiene product. Schools should have pads and tampons readily available on hand. They should be comfortable and effective first and foremost.

In my opinion, I think they should be provided as needed. It’s a reality that girls go through “that time of the month.” Hygiene products are a basic need. It’s a fact of life.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, I think they should be provided as needed. It’s a reality that girls go through “that time of the month.” Hygiene products are a basic need. It’s a fact of life. Some families provide them for adolescents. Some families don't for a variety of reasons. Sometimes families are too poor and can't afford to buy feminine hygiene products. Some families are neglectful and simply don't make it a priority to provide these products. It would be a shame for a student to be in school and not have a pad or tampon when it is needed. So, it's up to schools to be prepared.

Every school should have a plan. Just like they have a plan if a student falls and needs ice for her knee, or a band-aid or if there’s an emergency, there should be a plan if someone needs a feminine hygiene product. Schools should have pads and tampons readily available on hand. They should be comfortable and effective first and foremost. Secondly, they should be easy to access.

In my opinion, I think they should be provided as needed. It’s a reality that girls go through “that time of the month.” Hygiene products are a basic need. It’s a fact of life. Some families provide them for adolescents. Some families don't for a variety of reasons. Sometimes families are too poor and can't afford to buy feminine hygiene products. Some families are neglectful and simply don't make it a priority to provide these products. It would be a shame for a student to be in school and not have a pad or tampon when it is needed. So, it's up to schools to be prepared.

Every school should have a plan. Just like they have a plan if a student falls and needs ice for her knee, or a band-aid or if there’s an emergency, there should be a plan if someone needs a feminine hygiene product.

In my opinion, I think they should be provided as needed. It’s a reality that girls go through “that time of the month.” Hygiene products are a basic need. It’s a fact of life. Some families provide them for adolescents. Some families don't for a variety of reasons. Sometimes families are too poor and can't afford to buy feminine hygiene products. Some families are neglectful and simply don't make it a priority to provide these products. It would be a shame for a student to be in school and not have a pad or tampon when it is needed. So, it's up to schools to be prepared.

Every school should have a plan. Just like they have a plan if a student falls and needs ice for her knee, or a band-aid or if there’s an emergency, there should be a plan if someone needs a feminine hygiene product. Schools should have pads and tampons readily available on hand. They should be comfortable and effective first and foremost. Secondly, they should be easy to access.

Some families provide them for adolescents. Some families don't for a variety of reasons. Sometimes families are too poor and can't afford to buy feminine hygiene products. Some families are neglectful and simply don't make it a priority to provide these products. It would be a shame for a student to be in school and not have a pad or tampon when it is needed. So, it's up to schools to be prepared.

Every school should have a plan. Just like they have a plan if a student falls and needs ice for her knee, or a band-aid or if there’s an emergency, there should be a plan if someone needs a feminine hygiene product. Schools should have pads and tampons readily available on hand. They should be comfortable and effective first and foremost. Secondly, they should be easy to access. No one wants to go back to the nurse and say, “I need a pad.” There should be a designated place in every restroo",1444,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,864

In my opinion, I think they should be provided as needed. It’s a reality that girls go through “that time of the month.” Hygiene products are a basic need. It’s a fact of life. Some families provide them for adolescents. Some families don't for a variety of reasons. Sometimes families are too poor and can't afford to buy feminine hygiene products. Some families are neglectful and simply don't make it a priority to provide these products. It would be a shame for a student to be in school and not have a pad or tampon when it is needed. So, it's up to schools to be prepared.

Every school should have a plan. Just like they have a plan if a student falls and needs ice for her knee, or a band-aid or if there’s an emergency, there should be a plan if someone needs a feminine hygiene product. Schools should have pads and tampons readily available on hand. They should be comfortable and effective first and foremost. Secondly, they should be easy to access. No one wants to go back to the nurse and say, “I need a pad.” There should be a designated place in every restroom. That way it’s just there for the taking. And",1491,[],0,2,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,883

In my opinion, I think they should be provided as needed. It’s a reality that girls go through “that time of the month.” Hygiene products are a basic need. It’s a fact of life. Some families provide them for adolescents. Some families don't for a variety of reasons. Sometimes families are too poor and can't afford to buy feminine hygiene products. Some families are neglectful and simply don't make it a priority to provide these products. It would be a shame for a student to be in school and not have a pad or tampon when it is needed. So, it's up to schools to be prepared.

Every school should have a plan. Just like they have a plan if a student falls and needs ice for her knee, or a band-aid or if there’s an emergency, there should be a plan if someone needs a feminine hygiene product.

Schools should have pads and tampons readily available on hand. They should be comfortable and effective first and foremost. Secondly, they should be easy to access. No one wants to go back to the nurse and say, “I need a pad.” There should be a designated place in every restroom. That way it’s just there for the taking. And everyone will be on their way to  a happier period",1542,[],0,2,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,938

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, I think they should be provided as needed. It’s a reality that girls go through “that time of the month.” Hygiene products are a basic need. It’s a fact of life. Some families provide them for adolescents. Some families don't for a variety of reasons. Sometimes families are too poor and can't afford to buy feminine hygiene products. Some families are neglectful and simply don't make it a priority to provide these products. It would be a shame for a student to be in school and not have a pad or tampon when it is needed. So, it's up to schools to be prepared.
