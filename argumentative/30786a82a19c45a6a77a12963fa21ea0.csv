If you want to climb mountains, then do it.  I think the manner in which a person goes about extreme sports says a lot about their character.

But if the person is careful, prepared, and plans well, then they should enjoy the thrills they seek. Another aspect of extreme sports is the competition. How does one outdo their opponent without getting hurt? I think that is where the line is drawn. There should be no harm done to the opponent or to yourself. But there should be clear rules that define winning and to define what is allowed in fair play.

In my opinion, the answer to the question of whether or not it is selfish to pursue risky sports like extreme mountain climbing is no. Participating in sports or any hobby is a personal freedom. If you want to climb mountains, then do it.  I think the manner in which a person goes about extreme sports says a lot about their character.

But if the person is careful, prepared, and plans well, then they should enjoy the thrills they seek. Another aspect of extreme sports is the competition. How does one outdo their opponent without getting hurt? I think that is where the line is drawn. There should be no harm done to the opponent or to yourself. But there should be clear rules that define winning and to define what is allowed in fair play.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, the answer to the question of whether or not it is selfish to pursue risky sports like extreme mountain climbing is no. Participating in sports or any hobby is a personal freedom. If you want to climb mountains, then do it.  I think the manner in which a person goes about extreme sports says a lot about their character. For example, if a person is reckless and does not take the proper safety precautions, then they are being selfish.
