In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates.

For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to,",1839,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1149

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not on",1856,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1166

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

Audiobooks are also accessible in areas where books may not be available. Not everyone has a tablet, and many people attempting to read e-books on public transit or on trains experience difficulties doing so, either due to the glare on their screen or just the general inconvenience of reading while moving.",2178,[],2,2,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1446

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

Audiobooks are also accessible in areas where books may not be available.

Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

Audiobooks are also accessible in areas where books may not be available. Not everyone has a tablet, and many people attempting to read e-books on public transit or on trains experience difficulties like motion sickness, while doing so, either due to the glare on their screen or just the general inconvenience of reading while moving.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

Audiobooks are also accessible in areas where books may not be available. Not everyone has a tablet, and many people attempting to read e-books on public transit or on trains experience difficulties like motion sickness, while doing so, either due to the glare on their screen or just the general inconvenience of reading while moving.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

Audiobooks are also accessible in areas where books may not be available. Not everyone has a tablet, and many people attempting to read e-books on public transit or on trains experience difficulties like motion sickness, while doing so, either due to the glare on their screen or just the general inconvenience of reading while moving.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

Audiobooks are also accessible in areas where books may not be available.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

Audiobooks are also accessible in areas where books may not be available. Not everyone has a tablet, and many people attempting to read e-books on public transit or on trains experience difficulties like motion sickness, while doing so, either due to the glare on their screen or just the general inconvenience of reading while moving. Also, audiobooks enable us to tune out distractions while listening to them on headphones in public settings like mass transit, whereas books lack the ability to do that.

There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

Audiobooks are also accessible in areas where books may not be available. Not everyone has a tablet, and many people attempting to read e-books on public transit or on trains experience difficulties like motion sickness, while doing so, either due to the glare on their screen or just the general inconvenience of reading while moving.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

Audiobooks are also accessible in areas where books may not be available. Not everyone has a tablet, and many people attempting to read e-books on public transit or on trains experience difficulties like motion sickness, while doing so, either due to the glare on their screen or just the general inconvenience of reading while moving.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

Audiobooks are also accessible in areas where books may not be available. Not everyone has a tablet, and many people attempting to read e-books on public transit or on trains experience difficulties like motion sickness, while doing so, either due to the glare on their screen or just the general inconvenience of reading while moving. Also, audiobooks enable us to tune out distractions while listening to them on headphones in public settings like mass transit, whereas books lack the ability to do that.

For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

Audiobooks are also accessible in areas where books may not be available. Not everyone has a tablet, and many people attempting to read e-books on public transit or on trains experience difficulties like motion sickness, while doing so, either due to the glare on their screen or just the general inconvenience of reading while moving. Also, audiobooks enable us to tune out distractions while listening to them on headphones in public settings like mass transit, whereas books lack the ability to do that.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

Audiobooks are also accessible in areas where books may not be available. Not everyone has a tablet, and many people attempting to read e-books on public transit or on trains experience difficulties like motion sickness, while doing so, either due to the glare on their screen or just the general inconvenience of reading while moving.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates.

Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

Audiobooks are also accessible in areas where books may not be available. Not everyone has a tablet, and many people attempting to read e-books on public transit or on trains experience difficulties like motion sickness, while doing so, either due to the glare on their screen or just the general inconvenience of reading while moving. Also, audiobooks enable us to tune out distractions while listening to them on headphones in public settings like mass transit, whereas books lack the ability to do that.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

Audiobooks are also accessible in areas where books may not be available. Not everyone has a tablet, and many people attempting to read e-books on public transit or on trains experience difficulties like motion sickness, while doing so, either due to the glare on their screen or just the general inconvenience of reading while moving. Also, audiobooks enable us to tune out distractions while listening to them on headphones in public settings like mass transit, whereas books lack the ability to do that.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

Audiobooks are also accessible in areas where books may not be available. Not everyone has a tablet, and many people attempting to read e-books on public transit or on trains experience difficulties like motion sickness, while doing so, either due to the glare on their screen or just the general inconvenience of reading while moving.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates.

For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

Audiobooks are also accessible in areas where books may not be available. Not everyone has a tablet, and many people attempting to read e-books on public transit or on trains experience difficulties like motion sickness, while doing so, either due to the glare on their screen or just the general inconvenience of reading while moving. Also, audiobooks enable us to tune out distractions while listening to them on headphones in public settings like mass transit, whereas books lack the ability to do that.

In closing, audiobooks are in no regard worse than books, and in many ways, better. If I were forced to choose one over the other, ",2618,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1836

The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

Audiobooks are also accessible in areas where books may not be available. Not everyone has a tablet, and many people attempting to read e-books on public transit or on trains experience difficulties like motion sickness, while doing so, either due to the glare on their screen or just the general inconvenience of reading while moving. Also, audiobooks enable us to tune out distractions while listening to them on headphones in public settings like mass transit, whereas books lack the ability to do that.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

Audiobooks are also accessible in areas where books may not be available.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

Audiobooks are also accessible in areas where books may not be available. Not everyone has a tablet, and many people attempting to read e-books on public transit or on trains experience difficulties like motion sickness, while doing so, either due to the glare on their screen or just the general inconvenience of reading while moving.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

Audiobooks are also accessible in areas where books may not be available. Not everyone has a tablet, and many people attempting to read e-books on public transit or on trains experience difficulties like motion sickness, while doing so, either due to the glare on their screen or just the general inconvenience of reading while moving. Also, audiobooks enable us to tune out distractions while listening to them on headphones in public settings like mass transit, whereas books lack the ability to do that.

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

Audiobooks are also accessible in areas where books may not be available. Not everyone has a tablet, and many people attempting to read e-books on public transit or on trains experience difficulties like motion sickness, while doing so, either due to the glare on their screen or just the general inconvenience of reading while moving. Also, audiobooks enable us to tune out distractions while listening to them on headphones in public settings like mass transit, whereas books lack the ability to do that.
