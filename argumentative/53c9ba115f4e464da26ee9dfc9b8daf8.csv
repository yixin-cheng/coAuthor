It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, all that time spent in front of a computer or phone screen, even if it is understandable under the circumstances,  is not good for us. It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, all that time spent in front of a computer or phone screen, even if it is understandable under the circumstances,  is not good for us. It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication. While the impact on adults might be relatively minor, all this screen time is causing a generation of children to miss out on the important developmental benefits of face-to-face interaction.

It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication. While the impact on adults might be relatively minor, all this screen time is causing a generation of children to miss out on the important developmental benefits of face-to-face interaction.

In my opinion, all that time spent in front of a computer or phone screen, even if it is understandable under the circumstances,  is not good for us. It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication.

It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication. While the impact on adults might be relatively minor, all this screen time is causing a generation of children to miss out on the important developmental benefits of face-to-face interaction.

Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

In my opinion, all that time spent in front of a computer or phone screen, even if it is understandable under the circumstances,  is not good for us. It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication.

In my opinion, all that time spent in front of a computer or phone screen, even if it is understandable under the circumstances,  is not good for us. It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication.

Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity.

Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication. While the impact on adults might be relatively minor, all this screen time is causing a generation of children to miss out on the important developmental benefits of face-to-face interaction.

In my opinion, all that time spent in front of a computer or phone screen, even if it is understandable under the circumstances,  is not good for us.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, all that time spent in front of a computer or phone screen, even if it is understandable under the circumstances,  is not good for us. It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication. While the impact on adults might be relatively minor, all this screen time is causing a generation of children to miss out on the important developmental benefits of face-to-face interaction.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, all that time spent in front of a computer or phone screen, even if it is understandable under the circumstances,  is not good for us. It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication. While the impact on adults might be relatively minor, all this screen time is causing a generation of children to miss out on the important developmental benefits of face-to-face interaction.

In terms of general connection with the world around us, screen time is causing us to miss out on real things, occurring in our neighborhoods and communities, and focus on arbitrary things, occurring only on the internet. or on the other side of the world. In this way, screen time is causing us to lose a proper sense of place and connection with the world around us, and by that, I mean the portions of the world that should be important and meaningful to us. Instead we're ending up with stronger connections to people we will never meet, places we will never visit, and things that don't really affect us.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, all that time spent in front of a computer or phone screen, even if it is understandable under the circumstances,  is not good for us. It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication. While the impact on adults might be relatively minor, all this screen time is causing a generation of children to miss out on the important developmental benefits of face-to-face interaction.

In terms of general connection with the world around us, screen time is causing us to miss out on real things, occurring in our neighborhoods and communities, and focus on arbitrary things, occurring only on the internet. or on the other side of the world. In this way, screen time is causing us to lose a proper sense of place and connection with the world around us, and by that, I mean the portions of the world that should be important and meaningful to us. Instead we're ending up with stronger connections to people we will never meet, places we will never visit, and things that don't really affect us.

In my opinion, all that time spent in front of a computer or phone screen, even if it is understandable under the circumstances,  is not good for us. It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, all that time spent in front of a computer or phone screen, even if it is understandable under the circumstances,  is not good for us. It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication. While the impact on adults might be relatively minor, all this screen time is causing a generation of children to miss out on the important developmental benefits of face-to-face interaction.

In terms of general connection with the world around us, screen time is causing us to miss out on real things, occurring in our neighborhoods and communities, and focus on arbitrary things, occurring only on the internet. or on the other side of the world. In this way, screen time is causing us to lose a proper sense of place and connection with the world around us, and by that, I mean the portions of the world that should be important and meaningful to us. Instead we're ending up with stronger connections to people we will never meet, places we will never visit, and things that don't really affect us.

It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication. While the impact on adults might be relatively minor, all this screen time is causing a generation of children to miss out on the important developmental benefits of face-to-face interaction.

In terms of general connection with the world around us, screen time is causing us to miss out on real things, occurring in our neighborhoods and communities, and focus on arbitrary things, occurring only on the internet. or on the other side of the world. In this way, screen time is causing us to lose a proper sense of place and connection with the world around us, and by that, I mean the portions of the world that should be important and meaningful to us. Instead we're ending up with stronger connections to people we will never meet, places we will never visit, and things that don't really affect us.

In my opinion, all that time spent in front of a computer or phone screen, even if it is understandable under the circumstances,  is not good for us. It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication.

In my opinion, all that time spent in front of a computer or phone screen, even if it is understandable under the circumstances,  is not good for us. It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication.

In my opinion, all that time spent in front of a computer or phone screen, even if it is understandable under the circumstances,  is not good for us. It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication. While the impact on adults might be relatively minor, all this screen time is causing a generation of children to miss out on the important developmental benefits of face-to-face interaction.

In my opinion, all that time spent in front of a computer or phone screen, even if it is understandable under the circumstances,  is not good for us. It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication.

In my opinion, all that time spent in front of a computer or phone screen, even if it is understandable under the circumstances,  is not good for us. It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication. While the impact on adults might be relatively minor, all this screen time is causing a generation of children to miss out on the important developmental benefits of face-to-face interaction.

In terms of general connection with the world around us, screen time is causing us to miss out on real things, occurring in our neighborhoods and communities, and focus on arbitrary things, occurring only on the internet. or on the other side of the world. In this way, screen time is causing us to lose a proper sense of place and connection with the world around us, and by that, I mean the portions of the world that should be important and meaningful to us. Instead we're ending up with stronger connections to people we will never meet, places we will never visit, and things that don't really affect us.

The fact is, the dramatic increase in relying on computers and the internet to get by, was meant to be a temporary solution to a short-term problem.

In my opinion, all that time spent in front of a computer or phone screen, even if it is understandable under the circumstances,  is not good for us. It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication. While the impact on adults might be relatively minor, all this screen time is causing a generation of children to miss out on the important developmental benefits of face-to-face interaction.

In my opinion, all that time spent in front of a computer or phone screen, even if it is understandable under the circumstances,  is not good for us. It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, all that time spent in front of a computer or phone screen, even if it is understandable under the circumstances,  is not good for us. It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication. While the impact on adults might be relatively minor, all this screen time is causing a generation of children to miss out on the important developmental benefits of face-to-face interaction.

It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication. While the impact on adults might be relatively minor, all this screen time is causing a generation of children to miss out on the important developmental benefits of face-to-face interaction.

In terms of general connection with the world around us, screen time is causing us to miss out on real things, occurring in our neighborhoods and communities, and focus on arbitrary things, occurring only on the internet. or on the other side of the world. In this way, screen time is causing us to lose a proper sense of place and connection with the world around us, and by that, I mean the portions of the world that should be important and meaningful to us. Instead we're ending up with stronger connections to people we will never meet, places we will never visit, and things that don't really affect us.

The fact is, the dramatic increase in relying on computers and the internet to get by, was meant to be a temporary solution to a short-term problem. It was never meant to be a permanent solution to a long-term problem, and if we treat it that way, we may find that the problems it causes, are far worse than anything caused by a nov",2734,[],0,1,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1793

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication. While the impact on adults might be relatively minor, all this screen time is causing a generation of children to miss out on the important developmental benefits of face-to-face interaction.

In terms of general connection with the world around us, screen time is causing us to miss out on real things, occurring in our neighborhoods and communities, and focus on arbitrary things, occurring only on the internet. or on the other side of the world. In this way, screen time is causing us to lose a proper sense of place and connection with the world around us, and by that, I mean the portions of the world that should be important and meaningful to us. Instead we're ending up with stronger connections to people we will never meet, places we will never visit, and things that don't really affect us.

The fact is, the dramatic increase in relying on computers and the internet to get by, was meant to be a temporary solution to a short-term problem. It was never meant to be a permanent solution to a long-term problem, and if we treat it that way, we may find that the problems it causes, are far worse than anything caused by a novel flu virus",2746,[],0,1,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1805

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, all that time spent in front of a computer or phone screen, even if it is understandable under the circumstances,  is not good for us. It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain.
