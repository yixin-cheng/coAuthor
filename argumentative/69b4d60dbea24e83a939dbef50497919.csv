In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function. Following the news, however, is not, and should not be used as a measure of good or bad citizenship.

It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies.

However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function.

It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function.

So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function. Following the news, however, is not, and should not be used as a measure of good or bad citizenship.

The question then becomes, is it even useful, or desirable to follow it? I think it is useful, but not for the reasons most people do. It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable. That being the case, following the news can suck up a lot of time, and time is a valuable resource, that might be better devoted to meeting one's actual obligations.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function. Following the news, however, is not, and should not be used as a measure of good or bad citizenship.

The question then becomes, is it even useful, or desirable to follow it? I think it is useful, but not for the reasons most people do. It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function. Following the news, however, is not, and should not be used as a measure of good or bad citizenship.

The question then becomes, is it even useful, or desirable to follow it? I think it is useful, but not for the reasons most people do. It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable. That being the case, following the news can suck up a lot of time, and time is a valuable resource, that might be better devoted to meeting one's actual obligations.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function. Following the news, however, is not, and should not be used as a measure of good or bad citizenship.

The question then becomes, is it even useful, or desirable to follow it? I think it is useful, but not for the reasons most people do. It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable. That being the case, following the news can suck up a lot of time, and time is a valuable resource, that might be better devoted to meeting one's actual obligations.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function.

It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function.

The question then becomes, is it even useful, or desirable to follow it? I think it is useful, but not for the reasons most people do. It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function.

It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies.

However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function. Following the news, however, is not, and should not be used as a measure of good or bad citizenship.

The question then becomes, is it even useful, or desirable to follow it? I think it is useful, but not for the reasons most people do. It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable. That being the case, following the news can suck up a lot of time, and time is a valuable resource, that might be better devoted to meeting one's actual obligations. The news can also be very upsetting, and can cause unnecessary anxiety and stress. It could be said that being a good citizen might be better served, by not ",2083,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1385

It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed.

However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function. Following the news, however, is not, and should not be used as a measure of good or bad citizenship.

The question then becomes, is it even useful, or desirable to follow it? I think it is useful, but not for the reasons most people do. It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable. That being the case, following the news can suck up a lot of time, and time is a valuable resource, that might be better devoted to meeting one's actual obligations. The news can also be very upsetting, and can cause unnecessary anxiety and stress.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function.

So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function. Following the news, however, is not, and should not be used as a measure of good or bad citizenship.

The question then becomes, is it even useful, or desirable to follow it? I think it is useful, but not for the reasons most people do. It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable. That being the case, following the news can suck up a lot of time, and time is a valuable resource, that might be better devoted to meeting one's actual obligations. The news can also be very upsetting, and can cause unnecessary anxiety and stress. It could be said that being a good citizen might be better served, by not following the news, and causing oneself stress, and wasting time, and that a good citizen should instead expend their effort on focusing on their own life, and the lives of those one is responsible for.",2229,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1510

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function. Following the news, however, is not, and should not be used as a measure of good or bad citizenship.

The question then becomes, is it even useful, or desirable to follow it? I think it is useful, but not for the reasons most people do. It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable. That being the case, following the news can suck up a lot of time, and time is a valuable resource, that might be better devoted to meeting one's actual obligations. The news can also be very upsetting, and can cause unnecessary anxiety and stress.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable. That being the case, following the news can suck up a lot of time, and time is a valuable resource, that might be better devoted to meeting one's actual obligations. The news can also be very upsetting, and can cause unnecessary anxiety and stress. It could be said that being a good citizen might be better served, by not following the news, and causing oneself stress, and wasting time, and that a good citizen should instead expend their effort on focusing on their own life, and the lives of those they are responsible for.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function. Following the news, however, is not, and should not be used as a measure of good or bad citizenship.

The question then becomes, is it even useful, or desirable to follow it? I think it is useful, but not for the reasons most people do. It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable. That being the case, following the news can suck up a lot of time, and time is a valuable resource, that might be better devoted to meeting one's actual obligations. The news can also be very upsetting, and can cause unnecessary anxiety and stress. It could be said that being a good citizen might be better served, by not following the news, and causing oneself stress, and wasting time, and that a good citizen should instead expend their effort on focusing on their own life, and the lives of those they are responsible for.

However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable. That being the case, following the news can suck up a lot of time, and time is a valuable resource, that might be better devoted to meeting one's actual obligations. The news can also be very upsetting, and can cause unnecessary anxiety and stress. It could be said that being a good citizen might be better served, by not following the news, and causing oneself stress, and wasting time, and that a good citizen should instead expend their effort on focusing on their own life, and the lives of those they are responsible for.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function. Following the news, however, is not, and should not be used as a measure of good or bad citizenship.

The question then becomes, is it even useful, or desirable to follow it? I think it is useful, but not for the reasons most people do. It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable. That being the case, following the news can suck up a lot of time, and time is a valuable resource, that might be better devoted to meeting one's actual obligations. The news can also be very upsetting, and can cause unnecessary anxiety and stress. It could be said that being a good citizen might be better served, by not following the news, and causing oneself stress, and wasting time, and that a good citizen should instead expend their effort on focusing on their own life, and the lives of those they are responsible for.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function.

However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable. That being the case, following the news can suck up a lot of time, and time is a valuable resource, that might be better devoted to meeting one's actual obligations. The news can also be very upsetting, and can cause unnecessary anxiety and stress. It could be said that being a good citizen might be better served, by not following the news, and causing oneself stress, and wasting time, and that a good citizen should instead expend their effort on focusing on their own life, and the lives of those they are responsible for.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function. Following the news, however, is not, and should not be used as a measure of good or bad citizenship.

The question then becomes, is it even useful, or desirable to follow it? I think it is useful, but not for the reasons most people do. It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable. That being the case, following the news can suck up a lot of time, and time is a valuable resource, that might be better devoted to meeting one's actual obligations.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function.

It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable. That being the case, following the news can suck up a lot of time, and time is a valuable resource, that might be better devoted to meeting one's actual obligations.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function. Following the news, however, is not, and should not be used as a measure of good or bad citizenship.

The question then becomes, is it even useful, or desirable to follow it? I think it is useful, but not for the reasons most people do. It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function. Following the news, however, is not, and should not be used as a measure of good or bad citizenship.

The question then becomes, is it even useful, or desirable to follow it? I think it is useful, but not for the reasons most people do. It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable. That being the case, following the news can suck up a lot of time, and time is a valuable resource, that might be better devoted to meeting one's actual obligations. The news can also be very upsetting, and can cause unnecessary anxiety and stress. It could be said that being a good citizen might be better served, by not following the news, and causing oneself stress, and wasting time, and that a good citizen should instead expend their effort on focusing on their own life, and the lives of those they are responsible for.

Following the news, however, is not, and should not be used as a measure of good or bad citizenship.

The question then becomes, is it even useful, or desirable to follow it? I think it is useful, but not for the reasons most people do. It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable. That being the case, following the news can suck up a lot of time, and time is a valuable resource, that might be better devoted to meeting one's actual obligations. The news can also be very upsetting, and can cause unnecessary anxiety and stress. It could be said that being a good citizen might be better served, by not following the news, and causing oneself stress, and wasting time, and that a good citizen should instead expend their effort on focusing on their own life, and the lives of those they are responsible for.

I'd say being well informed is a nice idea, and a good goal to strive for, but that it is not a duty, and that it is not something that should be used to judge a person's status as a citizen, but instead it is a personal choice, and a personal goal, that could be considered ",2564,[],2,2,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1690

If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable. That being the case, following the news can suck up a lot of time, and time is a valuable resource, that might be better devoted to meeting one's actual obligations. The news can also be very upsetting, and can cause unnecessary anxiety and stress. It could be said that being a good citizen might be better served, by not following the news, and causing oneself stress, and wasting time, and that a good citizen should instead expend their effort on focusing on their own life, and the lives of those they are responsible for.

I'd say being well informed is a nice idea, and a good goal to strive for, but that it is not a duty, and that it is not something that should be used to judge a person's status as a citizen, but instead it is a personal choice, and a personal goal, that could be considered a luxury, pu",2576,[],2,2,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1702

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function.

It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function.

It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function. Following the news, however, is not, and should not be used as a measure of good or bad citizenship.

The question then becomes, is it even useful, or desirable to follow it? I think it is useful, but not for the reasons most people do. It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable. That being the case, following the news can suck up a lot of time, and time is a valuable resource, that might be better devoted to meeting one's actual obligations.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function.

It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function.

It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable. That being the case, following the news can suck up a lot of time, and time is a valuable resource, that might be better devoted to meeting one's actual obligations.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function. Following the news, however, is not, and should not be used as a measure of good or bad citizenship.

The question then becomes, is it even useful, or desirable to follow it? I think it is useful, but not for the reasons most people do. It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable. That being the case, following the news can suck up a lot of time, and time is a valuable resource, that might be better devoted to meeting one's actual obligations.

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function.
