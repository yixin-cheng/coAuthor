In my opinion, we should keep up with what's going on in the world.   We should always be informed and current on what is happening because if something big happens we should know how it affects us and our community. It is our responsibility as citizens to stay informed.  
Some people might not engage with current events because they don't have time , but that is their choice. I have heard many times, if you're not informed, then you don't have a voice.  I think staying informed does matter. In everyday life, it might be overwhelming to try to take on news or any new information. But there might come a time when there's a sudden big change or change in events that directly affects you. If that should happen, you might be faced with tough decisions that have to be made fast. At that point, it will be too late to do all the research to help you determine the best action and who to trust.   I personally think we should be aware and follow current events. Some people find the news to be depressing because they always cover death and disaster. But there are many news sources available these days that cover a variety of topics.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, we should keep up with what's going on in the world.   We should always be informed and current on what is happening because if something big happens we should know how it affects us and our community. It is our responsibility as citizens to stay informed.  
Some people might not engage with current events because they don't have time , but that is their choice. I have heard many times, if you're not informed, then you don't have a voice.  I think staying informed does matter. In everyday life, it might be overwhelming to try to take on news or any new information. But there might come a time when there's a sudden big change or change in events that directly affects you. If that should happen, you might be faced with tough decisions that have to be made fast. At that point, it will be too late to do all the research to help you determine the best action and who to trust.   I personally think we should be aware and follow current events. Some people find the news to be depressing because they always cover death and disaster. But there are many news sources available these days that cover a variety of topics.
