In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I think that the amount of money that they bring in for their schools is enough to pay them. The NCAA is a non-profit organization that makes billions of dollars off of college athletics. The NCAA is a monopoly that has no competition.

Even if athletes received a small stipend, it would not hurt the NCAA. The NCAA would still make billions of dollars off of college athletics.
Schools would bid for top athletes and increase competition.  Athletes would realize their options in a free market. They could go anywhere, do anything with the school of their choice. 

Television networks also make millions off college athletics. College athletes deserve to be paid because they are the ones that bring in the money. They should be allowed to make endorsement deals and do advertisements.

 Allowing them the option to play for pay would give them options.  It's only fair to give them a portion of the proceeds. There's enough to go around!

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I think that the amount of money that they bring in for their schools is enough to pay them. The NCAA is a non-profit organization that makes billions of dollars off of college athletics. The NCAA is a monopoly that has no competition.

Even if athletes received a small stipend, it would not hurt the NCAA. The NCAA would still make billions of dollars off of college athletics.

 Allowing them the option to play for pay would give them options.  It's only fair to give them a portion of the proceeds. There's enough to go around!

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I think that the amount of money that they bring in for their schools is enough to pay them. The NCAA is a non-profit organization that makes billions of dollars off of college athletics. The NCAA is a monopoly that has no competition.

Even if athletes received a small stipend, it would not hurt the NCAA. The NCAA would still make billions of dollars off of college athletics.
Schools would bid for top athletes and increase competition.  Athletes would realize their options in a free market. They could go anywhere, do anything with the school of their choice. 

Television networks also make millions off college athletics. College athletes deserve to be paid because they are the ones that bring in the money. They should be allowed to make endorsement deals and do advertisements. 

Schools benefit from athletes' contributions. Very often, the sports program generates the most m

ollege athletes deserve to be paid because they bring in millions of dollars for their schools.
 Allowing them the option to play for pay would give them options.  It's only fair to give them a portion of the proceeds. There's enough to go around!

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I think that the amount of money that they bring in for their schools is enough to pay them. The NCAA is a non-profit organization that makes billions of dollars off of college athletics. The NCAA is a monopoly that has no competition.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I think that the amount of money that they bring in for their schools is enough to pay them. The NCAA is a non-profit organization that makes billions of dollars off of college athletics. The NCAA is a monopoly that has no competition.

Even if athletes received a small stipend, it would not hurt the NCAA. The NCAA would still make billions of dollars off of college athletics.
Schools would bid for top athletes and increase competition.  Athletes would realize their options in a free market. They could go anywhere, do anything with the school of their choice.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I think that the amount of money that they bring in for their schools is enough to pay them. The NCAA is a non-profit organization that makes billions of dollars off of college athletics. The NCAA is a monopoly that has no competition.

Even if athletes received a small stipend, it would not hurt the NCAA. The NCAA would still make billions of dollars off of college athletics.
Schools would bid for top athletes and increase competition.  Athletes would realize their options in a free market. They could go anywhere, do anything with the school of their choice. 

Television networks also make millions off college athletics. College athletes deserve to be paid because they are the ones that bring in the money. They should be allowed to make endorsement deals and do advertisements. 

Schools benefit from athletes' contributions. Very often, the sports program generates the most money and attention for the school.  Athl

ollege athletes deserve to be paid because they bring in millions of dollars for their schools.
 Allowing them the option to play for pay would give them options.  It's only fair to give them a portion of the proceeds. There's enough to go around!

Even if athletes received a small stipend, it would not hurt the NCAA. The NCAA would still make billions of dollars off of college athletics.
Schools would bid for top athletes and increase competition.  Athletes would realize their options in a free market. They could go anywhere, do anything with the school of their choice. 

Television networks also make millions off college athletics. College athletes deserve to be paid because they are the ones that bring in the money. They should be allowed to make endorsement deals and do advertisements. 

Schools benefit from athletes' contributions. Very often, the sports program generates the most money and attention for the school.  Athletes should be able to benfi

ollege athletes deserve to be paid because they bring in millions of dollars for their schools.
 Allowing them the option to play for pay would give them options.  It's only fair to give them a portion of the proceeds. There's enough to go around!

Even if athletes received a small stipend, it would not hurt the NCAA. The NCAA would still make billions of dollars off of college athletics.
Schools would bid for top athletes and increase competition.  Athletes would realize their options in a free market. They could go anywhere, do anything with the school of their choice. 

Television networks also make millions off college athletics. College athletes deserve to be paid because they are the ones that bring in the money. They should be allowed to make endorsement deals and do advertisements.

ollege athletes deserve to be paid because they bring in millions of dollars for their schools.
 Allowing them the option to play for pay would give them options.  It's only fair to give them a portion of the proceeds. There's enough to go around!

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I think that the amount of money that they bring in for their schools is enough to pay them. The NCAA is a non-profit organization that makes billions of dollars off of college athletics. The NCAA is a monopoly that has no competition.

Even if athletes received a small stipend, it would not hurt the NCAA. The NCAA would still make billions of dollars off of college athletics.
Schools would bid for top athletes and increase competition.  Athletes would realize their options in a free market. They could go anywhere, do anything with the school of their choice. 

Television networks also make millions off college athletics. College athletes deserve to be paid because they are the ones that bring in the money. They should be allowed to make endorsement deals and do advertisements. 

Schools benefit from athletes' contributions. Very often, the sports program generates the most money and attention for the school.  Athletes should be able to benefit from their hard work and contributions

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I think that the amount of money that they bring in for their schools is enough to pay them. The NCAA is a non-profit organization that makes billions of dollars off of college athletics. The NCAA is a monopoly that has no competition.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I think that the amount of money that they bring in for their schools is enough to pay them. The NCAA is a non-profit organization that makes billions of dollars off of college athletics. The NCAA is a monopoly that has no competition.

Even if athletes received a small stipend, it would not hurt the NCAA. The NCAA would still make billions of dollars off of college athletics.
Schools would bid for top athletes and increase competition.  Athletes would realize their options in a free market. They could go anywhere, do anything with the school of their choice. 

Television networks also make millions off college athletics. College athletes deserve to be paid because they are the ones that bring in the money. They should be allowed to make endorsement deals and do advertisements. 

Schools benefit from athletes' contributions. Very often, the sports program generates the most money and attention for the school.  Athletes should be able to benefit from their hard work and contributions to the program.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I think that the amount of money that they bring in for their schools is enough to pay them. The NCAA is a non-profit organization that makes billions of dollars off of college athletics. The NCAA is a monopoly that has no competition.

Even if athletes received a small stipend, it would not hurt the NCAA. The NCAA would still make billions of dollars off of college athletics.
Schools would bid for top athletes and increase competition.  Athletes would realize their options in a free market. They could go anywhere, do anything with the school of their choice. 

Television networks also make millions off college athletics. College athletes deserve to be paid because they are the ones that bring in the money. They should be allowed to make endorsement deals and do advertisements.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I think that the amount of money that they bring in for their schools is enough to pay them. The NCAA is a non-profit organization that makes billions of dollars off of college athletics. The NCAA is a monopoly that has no competition.

Even if athletes received a small stipend, it would not hurt the NCAA. The NCAA would still make billions of dollars off of college athletics.
Schools would bid for top athletes and increase competition.  Athletes would realize their options in a free market. They could go anywhere, do anything with the school of their choice. 

Television networks also make millions off college athletics. College athletes deserve to be paid because they are the ones that bring in the money. They should be allowed to make endorsement deals and do advertisements. 

Schools benefit from athletes' contributions. Very often, the sports program generates the most money and attention for the school.  Athletes should be able to benefit from their hard work and contributions to the program.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I think that the amount of money that they bring in for their schools is enough to pay them. The NCAA is a non-profit organization that makes billions of dollars off of college athletics. The NCAA is a monopoly that has no competition.

Even if athletes received a small stipend, it would not hurt the NCAA. The NCAA would still make billions of dollars off of college athletics.
Schools would bid for top athletes and increase competition.  Athletes would realize their options in a free market. They could go anywhere, do anything with the school of their choice. 

Television networks also make millions off college athletics. College athletes deserve to be paid because they are the ones that bring in the money. They should be allowed to make endorsement deals and do advertisements.
