It is purely a tool, that accentuates the good and bad parts of each of us. It allows us to be more of ourselves, for better or for worse.  

Some dating apps have been great, making connections with great people with similar interests. Some have been terrible, connecting me with people who are ""verified"", but nothing like their profile, with nothing in common. 

Social media and the plethora of new streaming sites with dating shows has given us insight, and has given us unrealistic perceptions. 
It has fake people faking relations for superficial reasons. It has been the way some people have found true love in remote rural areas. 

There's sex toys, dolls,  virtual reality that remove any need for human interaction, destroying the basis for human relationships.
There's video calls with a spouse on another continent. Texts and E-cards for Valentine's day.

Technology is here. It can be a tool in forming and strengthening relationships-or it can be the downfall of them. It's up to us to use it wisely!
