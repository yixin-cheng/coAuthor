The most important thing I learned in school was how to have empathy and compassion. And my first lesson was in the summer after fourth grade.

I was a lonely, bookish kid. I had very few friends and the summer stretched out before me, a relentless and boring juggernaut. I was a voracious reader, but I had read everything in the house. I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man name Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was a kind, gentle man, and seemed to instantly understand why I was there.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to have empathy and compassion. And my first lesson was in the summer after fourth grade.

I was a lonely, bookish kid. I had very few friends and the summer stretched out before me, a relentless and boring juggernaut. I was a voracious reader, but I had read everything in the house. I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man name Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was a kind, gentle man, and seemed to instantly understand why I was there.

My father, an alcoholic, was seldom home and I had very little experience of a male parent. I had no idea what to expect from a father figure. That summer, Brother Aquinas gave me something I had been missing. He gave me a sense of what it was like to have a father.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to have empathy and compassion. And my first lesson was in the summer after fourth grade.

I was a lonely, bookish kid. I had very few friends and the summer stretched out before me, a relentless and boring juggernaut. I was a voracious reader, but I had read everything in the house. I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man name Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was a kind, gentle man, and seemed to instantly understand why I was there.

My father, an alcoholic, was seldom home and I had very little experience of a male parent. I had no idea what to expect from a father figure. That summer, Brother Aquinas gave me something I had been missing. He gave me a sense of what it was like to have a father.

I was a lonely, bookish kid. I had very few friends and the summer stretched out before me, a relentless and boring juggernaut. I was a voracious reader, but I had read everything in the house. I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man name Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was a kind, gentle man, and seemed to instantly understand why I was there.

My father, an alcoholic, was seldom home and I had very little experience of a male parent. I had no idea what to expect from a father figure. That summer, Brother Aquinas gave me something I had been missing. He gave me a sense of what it was like to have a father.

We settles into an easy companionship, and I spent most of the summer in that library, while my mother thought I was out torturing insects with the neighborhood sociopaths.
Brother Aquinas was a great storyteller.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to have empathy and compassion. And my first lesson was in the summer after fourth grade.

I was a lonely, bookish kid. I had very few friends and the summer stretched out before me, a relentless and boring juggernaut. I was a voracious reader, but I had read everything in the house. I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man name Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was a kind, gentle man, and seemed to instantly understand why I was there.

My father, an alcoholic, was seldom home and I had very little experience of a male parent. I had no idea what to expect from a father figure. That summer, Brother Aquinas gave me something I had been missing. He gave me a sense of what it was like to have a father.

We settles into an easy companionship, and I spent most of the summer in that library, while my mother thought I was out torturing insects with the neighborhood sociopaths.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to have empathy and compassion. And my first lesson was in the summer after fourth grade.

I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man name Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was a kind, gentle man, and seemed to instantly understand why I was there.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to have empathy and compassion. And my first lesson was in the summer after fourth grade.

I was a lonely, bookish kid. I had very few friends and the summer stretched out before me, a relentless and boring juggernaut. I was a voracious reader, but I had read everything in the house. I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man name Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was a kind, gentle man, and seemed to instantly understand why I was there.

My father, an alcoholic, was seldom home and I had very little experience of a male parent. I had no idea what to expect from a father figure. That summer, Brother Aquinas gave me something I had been missing. He gave me a sense of what it was like to have a father.

We settles into an easy companionship, and I spent most of the summer in that library, while my mother thought I was out torturing insects with the neighborhood sociopaths.
Brother Aquinas was a great storyteller.
 He told me stories about the saints and the lives of the great philosophers. He told me about the great thinkers of the world, and about the great thinkers of our time. His empathy and compassion  ",1743,[],0,4,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1170

I was a lonely, bookish kid. I had very few friends and the summer stretched out before me, a relentless and boring juggernaut. I was a voracious reader, but I had read everything in the house. I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man name Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was a kind, gentle man, and seemed to instantly understand why I was there.

My father, an alcoholic, was seldom home and I had very little experience of a male parent. I had no idea what to expect from a father figure. That summer, Brother Aquinas gave me something I had been missing. He gave me a sense of what it was like to have a father.

We settles into an easy companionship, and I spent most of the summer in that library, while my mother thought I was out torturing insects with the neighborhood sociopaths.
Brother Aquinas was a great storyteller.
 He told me stories about the saints and the lives of the great philosophers. He told me about the great thinkers of the world, and about the great thinkers of our time. His empathy and compassion  toward me made me wanr to have those quaklities too",1794,[],0,4,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1221

The most important thing I learned in school was how to have empathy and compassion. And my first lesson was in the summer after fourth grade.

I was a lonely, bookish kid. I had very few friends and the summer stretched out before me, a relentless and boring juggernaut. I was a voracious reader, but I had read everything in the house. I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man name Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was a kind, gentle man, and seemed to instantly understand why I was there.

My father, an alcoholic, was seldom home and I had very little experience of a male parent. I had no idea what to expect from a father figure. That summer, Brother Aquinas gave me something I had been missing. He gave me a sense of what it was like to have a father.

We settles into an easy companionship, and I spent most of the summer in that library, while my mother thought I was out torturing insects with the neighborhood sociopaths.
Brother Aquinas was a great storyteller.
 He told me stories about the saints and the lives of the great philosophers. He told me about the great thinkers of the world, and about the great thinkers of our time. His empathy and compassion  toward me made me want to have those qualities too.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to have empathy and compassion. And my first lesson was in the summer after fourth grade.

I was a lonely, bookish kid. I had very few friends and the summer stretched out before me, a relentless and boring juggernaut. I was a voracious reader, but I had read everything in the house. I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man name Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was a kind, gentle man, and seemed to instantly understand why I was there.

My father, an alcoholic, was seldom home and I had very little experience of a male parent. I had no idea what to expect from a father figure. That summer, Brother Aquinas gave me something I had been missing. He gave me a sense of what it was like to have a father.

We settles into an easy companionship, and I spent most of the summer in that library, while my mother thought I was out torturing insects with the neighborhood sociopaths.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to have empathy and compassion. And my first lesson was in the summer after fourth grade.

I was a lonely, bookish kid. I had very few friends and the summer stretched out before me, a relentless and boring juggernaut. I was a voracious reader, but I had read everything in the house. I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man name Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was a kind, gentle man, and seemed to instantly understand why I was there.

My father, an alcoholic, was seldom home and I had very little experience of a male parent. I had no idea what to expect from a father figure. That summer, Brother Aquinas gave me something I had been missing. He gave me a sense of what it was like to have a father.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to have empathy and compassion. And my first lesson was in the summer after fourth grade.

I was a lonely, bookish kid. I had very few friends and the summer stretched out before me, a relentless and boring juggernaut. I was a voracious reader, but I had read everything in the house. I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man name Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was a kind, gentle man, and seemed to instantly understand why I was there.

My father, an alcoholic, was seldom home and I had very little experience of a male parent. I had no idea what to expect from a father figure. That summer, Brother Aquinas gave me something I had been missing. He gave me a sense of what it was like to have a father.

We settles into an easy companionship, and I spent most of the summer in that library, while my mother thought I was out torturing insects with the neighborhood sociopaths.
Brother Aquinas was a great storyteller.
 He told me stories about the saints and the lives of the great philosophers. He told me about the great thinkers of the world, and about the great thinkers of our time. His empathy and compassion  toward me made me want to have those qualities too.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to have empathy and compassion. And my first lesson was in the summer after fourth grade.

I was a lonely, bookish kid. I had very few friends and the summer stretched out before me, a relentless and boring juggernaut. I was a voracious reader, but I had read everything in the house. I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man name Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was a kind, gentle man, and seemed to instantly understand why I was there.

My father, an alcoholic, was seldom home and I had very little experience of a male parent. I had no idea what to expect from a father figure. That summer, Brother Aquinas gave me something I had been missing. He gave me a sense of what it was like to have a father.

We settles into an easy companionship, and I spent most of the summer in that library, while my mother thought I was out torturing insects with the neighborhood sociopaths.
Brother Aquinas was a great storyteller.
 He told me stories about the saints and the lives of the great philosophers. He told me about the great thinkers of the world, and about the great thinkers of our time. His empathy and compassion  toward me made me want to have those qualities too.

I was a lonely, bookish kid. I had very few friends and the summer stretched out before me, a relentless and boring juggernaut. I was a voracious reader, but I had read everything in the house. I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man name Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was a kind, gentle man, and seemed to instantly understand why I was there.

My father, an alcoholic, was seldom home and I had very little experience of a male parent. I had no idea what to expect from a father figure. That summer, Brother Aquinas gave me something I had been missing. He gave me a sense of what it was like to have a father.

We settles into an easy companionship, and I spent most of the summer in that library, while my mother thought I was out torturing insects with the neighborhood sociopaths.
Brother Aquinas was a great storyteller.
 He told me stories about the saints and the lives of the great philosophers. He told me about the great thinkers of the world, and about the great thinkers of our time. His empathy and compassion  toward me made me want to have those qualities too.

I will never forget one thing he said to me near the end of the summer, I had asked him if he thought he would go to heaven. ""I wouldn't want to ",1941,[],0,4,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1383

The most important thing I learned in school was how to have empathy and compassion. And my first lesson was in the summer after fourth grade.

I was a lonely, bookish kid. I had very few friends and the summer stretched out before me, a relentless and boring juggernaut. I was a voracious reader, but I had read everything in the house. I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man name Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was a kind, gentle man, and seemed to instantly understand why I was there.

My father, an alcoholic, was seldom home and I had very little experience of a male parent. I had no idea what to expect from a father figure. That summer, Brother Aquinas gave me something I had been missing. He gave me a sense of what it was like to have a father.

I was a lonely, bookish kid. I had very few friends and the summer stretched out before me, a relentless and boring juggernaut. I was a voracious reader, but I had read everything in the house. I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man name Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was a kind, gentle man, and seemed to instantly understand why I was there.

My father, an alcoholic, was seldom home and I had very little experience of a male parent. I had no idea what to expect from a father figure. That summer, Brother Aquinas gave me something I had been missing. He gave me a sense of what it was like to have a father.

We settles into an easy companionship, and I spent most of the summer in that library, while my mother thought I was out torturing insects with the neighborhood sociopaths.
Brother Aquinas was a great storyteller.
 He told me stories about the saints and the lives of the great philosophers. He told me about the great thinkers of the world, and about the great thinkers of our time. His empathy and compassion  toward me made me want to have those qualities too.

I will never forget one thing he said to me near the end of the summer, I had asked him if he thought he would go to heaven. ""I wouldn't want to go to heaven,"" he said, ""unless",1972,[],0,4,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1414

The most important thing I learned in school was how to have empathy and compassion. And my first lesson was in the summer after fourth grade.

I was a lonely, bookish kid. I had very few friends and the summer stretched out before me, a relentless and boring juggernaut. I was a voracious reader, but I had read everything in the house. I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man name Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was a kind, gentle man, and seemed to instantly understand why I was there.

My father, an alcoholic, was seldom home and I had very little experience of a male parent. I had no idea what to expect from a father figure. That summer, Brother Aquinas gave me something I had been missing. He gave me a sense of what it was like to have a father.

We settles into an easy companionship, and I spent most of the summer in that library, while my mother thought I was out torturing insects with the neighborhood sociopaths.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to have empathy and compassion. And my first lesson was in the summer after fourth grade.

I was a lonely, bookish kid. I had very few friends and the summer stretched out before me, a relentless and boring juggernaut. I was a voracious reader, but I had read everything in the house. I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man name Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was a kind, gentle man, and seemed to instantly understand why I was there.

My father, an alcoholic, was seldom home and I had very little experience of a male parent. I had no idea what to expect from a father figure. That summer, Brother Aquinas gave me something I had been missing. He gave me a sense of what it was like to have a father.

We settles into an easy companionship, and I spent most of the summer in that library, while my mother thought I was out torturing insects with the neighborhood sociopaths.
Brother Aquinas was a great storyteller.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to have empathy and compassion. And my first lesson was in the summer after fourth grade.

I was a lonely, bookish kid. I had very few friends and the summer stretched out before me, a relentless and boring juggernaut. I was a voracious reader, but I had read everything in the house. I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man name Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was a kind, gentle man, and seemed to instantly understand why I was there.

My father, an alcoholic, was seldom home and I had very little experience of a male parent. I had no idea what to expect from a father figure. That summer, Brother Aquinas gave me something I had been missing. He gave me a sense of what it was like to have a father.

We settles into an easy companionship, and I spent most of the summer in that library, while my mother thought I was out torturing insects with the neighborhood sociopaths.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to have empathy and compassion. And my first lesson was in the summer after fourth grade.

I was a lonely, bookish kid. I had very few friends and the summer stretched out before me, a relentless and boring juggernaut. I was a voracious reader, but I had read everything in the house. I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man name Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was a kind, gentle man, and seemed to instantly understand why I was there.

My father, an alcoholic, was seldom home and I had very little experience of a male parent. I had no idea what to expect from a father figure. That summer, Brother Aquinas gave me something I had been missing. He gave me a sense of what it was like to have a father.

We settles into an easy companionship, and I spent most of the summer in that library, while my mother thought I was out torturing insects with the neighborhood sociopaths.
Brother Aquinas was a great storyteller.
 He told me stories about the saints and the lives of the great philosophers. He told me about the great thinkers of the world, and about the great thinkers of our time. His empathy and compassion  toward me made me want to have those qualities too.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to have empathy and compassion. And my first lesson was in the summer after fourth grade.

I was a lonely, bookish kid. I had very few friends and the summer stretched out before me, a relentless and boring juggernaut. I was a voracious reader, but I had read everything in the house. I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man name Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was a kind, gentle man, and seemed to instantly understand why I was there.

My father, an alcoholic, was seldom home and I had very little experience of a male parent. I had no idea what to expect from a father figure. That summer, Brother Aquinas gave me something I had been missing. He gave me a sense of what it was like to have a father.

We settles into an easy companionship, and I spent most of the summer in that library, while my mother thought I was out torturing insects with the neighborhood sociopaths.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to have empathy and compassion. And my first lesson was in the summer after fourth grade.

I was a lonely, bookish kid. I had very few friends and the summer stretched out before me a relentless and boring juggernaut. I was a voracious reader, but I had read everything in the house. I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man name Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was a kind, gentle man, and seemed to instantly understand why I was there.

My father, an alcoholic, was seldom home and I had very little experience of a male parent. I had no idea what to expect from a father figure. That summer, Brother Aquinas gave me something I had been missing. He gave me a sense of what it was like to have a father.

We settles into an easy companionship, and I spent most of the summer in that library, while my mother thought I was out torturing insects with the neighborhood sociopaths.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to have empathy and compassion. And my first lesson was in the summer after fourth grade.

I was a lonely, bookish kid. I had very few friends and the summer stretched out before me a relentless and boring juggernaut. I was a voracious reader, but I had read everything in the house. I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man named Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was kind and gentle, and seemed to instantly understand why I was there.

My father, an alcoholic, was seldom home and I had very little experience of a male parent. I had no idea what to expect from a father figure. That summer, Brother Aquinas gave me something I had been missing. He gave me a sense of what it was like to have a father.

We settles into an easy companionship, and I spent most of the summer in that library, while my mother thought I was out torturing insects with the neighborhood sociopaths.
Brother Aquinas was a great storyteller.
 He told me stories about the saints and the lives of the great philosophers. He told me about the great thinkers of the world, and about the great thinkers of our time. His empathy and compassion  toward me made me want to have those qualities too.
