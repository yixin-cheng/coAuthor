What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The kind of stereotypical characters that I see or read about that makes me cringe are the ones that are ultimately derivative, lazy, and plain hurtful to the people they are stereotyping. It could be somewhat of a mild trope being shown, and I would react with a mild discomfort as well.

 I can understand that the author came from a different time period, where such portrayals were the norm, but I would not want to support that kind of thinking. I don't find a strong value in reading books with characters that are offensive portrayal of others, in fact I think that those types of books do more harm than good.

Instead of breaking the norm and portraying characters in a more respectful and realistic manner, stereotypical characters are viewed as no more than their stereotypes and often negative traits, which can depict groups of people as inferior or less equal to other groups. Therefore, I believe people should support shows and other content that refrains from implementing stereotypes and stereotypical characters.
