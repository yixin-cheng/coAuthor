Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own.

Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own. I know that our kids do better with assigned readings when they can get the audiobook version. Seems ",1559,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1332

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book.

You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times.

Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening.

Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own. I know that our kids do better with assigned readings when they can get the audiobook version. Seems to be easier to break the procrastination when you can simply press play and listen to the book.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own. I know that our kids do better with assigned readings when they can get the audiobook version. Seems to be easier to break the procrastination when you can simply press play and listen to the book.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own. I know that our kids do better with assigned readings when they can get the audiobook version. Seems to be easier to break the procrastination when you can simply press play and listen to the book. I am mostly a fan of the audiobooks simply because it allows me to get more done around the house and in my life. I would pretty much always prefer the audiobook over the book personally.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own. I know that our kids do better with assigned readings when they can get the audiobook version. Seems to be easier to break the procrastination when you can simply press play and listen to the book. I am mostly a fan of the audiobooks simply because it allows me to get more done around the house and in my life. I would pretty much always prefer the audiobook over the book personally. I would rather lay down and close my eyes and listen to a book over sitting in a chair with the book open. I can even get up ad go to the bathroom if need be.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own. I know that our kids do better with assigned readings when they can get the audiobook version. Seems to be easier to break the procrastination when you can simply press play and listen to the book. I am mostly a fan of the audiobooks simply because it allows me to get more done around the house and in my life. I would pretty much always prefer the audiobook over the book personally. I would rather lay down and close my eyes and listen to a book over sitting in a chair with the book open. I can even get up ad go to the bathroom if need be.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own. I know that our kids do better with assigned readings when they can get the audiobook version. Seems to be easier to break the procrastination when you can simply press play and listen to the book. I am mostly a fan of the audiobooks simply because it allows me to get more done around the house and in my life. I would pretty much always prefer the audiobook over the book personally.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own. I know that our kids do better with assigned readings when they can get the audiobook version. Seems to be easier to break the procrastination when you can simply press play and listen to the book.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own. I know that our kids do better with assigned readings when they can get the audiobook version. Seems to be easier to break the procrastination when you can simply press play and listen to the book. I am mostly a fan of the audiobooks simply because it allows me to get more done around the house and in my life. I would pretty much always prefer the audiobook over the book personally. I would rather lay down and close my eyes and listen to a book over sitting in a chair with the book open. I can even get up ad go to the bathroom if need be.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own. I know that our kids do better with assigned readings when they can get the audiobook version. Seems to be easier to break the procrastination when you can simply press play and listen to the book. I am mostly a fan of the audiobooks simply because it allows me to get more done around the house and in my life. I would pretty much always prefer the audiobook over the book personally. I would rather lay down and close my eyes and listen to a book over sitting in a chair with the book open. I can even get up ad go to the bathroom if need be.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own. I know that our kids do better with assigned readings when they can get the audiobook version. Seems to be easier to break the procrastination when you can simply press play and listen to the book. I am mostly a fan of the audiobooks simply because it allows me to get more done around the house and in my life. I would pretty much always prefer the audiobook over the book personally.

You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own. I know that our kids do better with assigned readings when they can get the audiobook version. Seems to be easier to break the procrastination when you can simply press play and listen to the book. I am mostly a fan of the audiobooks simply because it allows me to get more done around the house and in my life. I would pretty much always prefer the audiobook over the book personally. I would rather lay down and close my eyes and listen to a book over sitting in a chair with the book open. I can even get up ad go to the bathroom if need be. I also love the ability to listen to the audiobooks when exercising. Going on jogs and listening to audiobooks is much more entertaining than i ever realized.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own. I know that our kids do better with assigned readings when they can get the audiobook version. Seems to be easier to break the procrastination when you can simply press play and listen to the book. I am mostly a fan of the audiobooks simply because it allows me to get more done around the house and in my life. I would pretty much always prefer the audiobook over the book personally. I would rather lay down and close my eyes and listen to a book over sitting in a chair with the book open. I can even get up ad go to the bathroom if need be.

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own. I know that our kids do better with assigned readings when they can get the audiobook version. Seems to be easier to break the procrastination when you can simply press play and listen to the book. I am mostly a fan of the audiobooks simply because it allows me to get more done around the house and in my life. I would pretty much always prefer the audiobook over the book personally. I would rather lay down and close my eyes and listen to a book over sitting in a chair with the book open. I can even get up ad go to the bathroom if need be. I also love the ability to listen to the audiobooks when exercising. Going on jogs and listening to audiobooks is much more entertaining than i ever realized.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own. I know that our kids do better with assigned readings when they can get the audiobook version. Seems to be easier to break the procrastination when you can simply press play and listen to the book. I am mostly a fan of the audiobooks simply because it allows me to get more done around the house and in my life. I would pretty much always prefer the audiobook over the book personally. I would rather lay down and close my eyes and listen to a book over sitting in a chair with the book open. I can even get up ad go to the bathroom if need be. I also love the ability to listen to the audiobooks when exercising. Going on jogs and listening to audiobooks is much more entertaining than i ever realized. In conclusion, i feel listening to a book is just as good as reading one.",2235,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,2102
