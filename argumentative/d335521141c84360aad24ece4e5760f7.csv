In my opinion, people are not being good citizens if they make no effort to keep up with the news. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and that it is our responsibility as citizens to be informed. 

Informed citizens make better decisions that benefit everyone because they have more knowledge about the lives of other people. This can even be beneficial for people in need. When folks are informed about a community in need through the news or some other source, only then can they act.
