It all seems a bit pretentious, even if it's a thrill -- not to mention expensive -- to hurtle oneself off a high cliff or summit if there is not a clearly-defined way of doing it well or poorly, or right or wrong.

In my opinion, whether a sport is reasonable or not depends on the purpose, goals and motives of the participants. Those who participate in the sport purely for recreation or adrenaline may promote a rationale for doing dangerous activities like skydiving, rock climbing or ski jumping, But what is the goal of the sport?  What defines winning? What defines losing? How do the rules determine what's fair and what's unfair?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, whether a sport is reasonable or not depends on the purpose, goals and motives of the participants. Those who participate in the sport purely for recreation or adrenaline may promote a rationale for doing dangerous activities like skydiving, rock climbing or ski jumping, But what is the goal of the sport?  What defines winning? What defines losing? How do the rules determine what's fair and what's unfair? It all seems a bit pretentious, even if it's a thrill -- not to mention expensive -- to hurtle oneself off a high cliff or summit if there is not a clearly-defined way of doing it well or poorly, or right or wrong.

Reckless and irresponsible behavior is condoned if the consequences are not likely to extend beyond the individual(s) who are participating.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, whether a sport is reasonable or not depends on the purpose, goals and motives of the participants. Those who participate in the sport purely for recreation or adrenaline may promote a rationale for doing dangerous activities like skydiving, rock climbing or ski jumping, But what is the goal of the sport?  What defines winning? What defines losing? How do the rules determine what's fair and what's unfair? It all seems a bit pretentious, even if it's a thrill -- not to mention expensive -- to hurtle oneself off a high cliff or summit if there is not a clearly-defined way of doing it well or poorly, or right or wrong. 
But if the goal of the sport is to achieve a specific outcome that has not yet been achieved, as in trying to travel farther or higher
, that increases the risk of someone getting hurt or damaging something. Reckless and irresponsible behavior is condoned if the consequences are not likely to extend beyond the individual(s) who are participating. Is that selfish when the sport can clearly be categorized as dangerous? I think so. Reckless behavior goes against the concept and principles in sport, which is honor, integrity, fairness and respect. Acting responsibly is something that should be frowned up, especially in competition.  
Sports teach much in the way of values, or principles that can help us to determine how we should live our lives.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, whether a sport is reasonable or not depends on the purpose, goals and motives of the participants. Those who participate in the sport purely for recreation or adrenaline may promote a rationale for doing dangerous activities like skydiving, rock climbing or ski jumping, But what is the goal of the sport?  What defines winning? What defines losing? How do the rules determine what's fair and what's unfair? It all seems a bit pretentious, even if it's a thrill -- not to mention expensive -- to hurtle oneself off a high cliff or summit if there is not a clearly-defined way of doing it well or poorly, or right or wrong. 
But if the goal of the sport is to achieve a specific outcome that has not yet been achieved, as in trying to travel farther or higher
, that increases the risk of someone getting hurt or damaging something. Reckless and irresponsible behavior is condoned if the consequences are not likely to extend beyond the individual(s) who are participating. Is that selfish when the sport can clearly be categorized as dangerous? I think so. Reckless behavior goes against the concept and principles in sport, which is honor, integrity, fairness and respect. Acting responsibly is something that should be frowned up, especially in competition.  
Sports teach much in the way of values, or principles that can help us to determine how we should live our lives.
