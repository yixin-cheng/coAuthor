In my opinion, technology is the most important subject that can be taught today because it is the future. It is literally in our everyday lives, and we use it everyday all the time. It is important to know how to use it and how it works. So it also helps to teach how to use it safely, because security is a big deal today. If you don't believe me ask all the people who have been hacked and lost bank accounts, social media accounts, game accounts, and even worse had their identities stolen right out from under them. That happens because some people do not understand technology, and how to use it properly and safely. 

Learning technology also helps set a person up for the future. I say that because there are not many jobs today that do not require some knowledge of how to use technology. Even the simple ones like working for McDonald's or other fast food or grocery stores.

In my opinion, technology is the most important subject that can be taught today because it is the future. It is literally in our everyday lives, and we use it everyday all the time.

That happens because some people do not understand technology, and how to use it properly and safely. 

Learning technology also helps set a person up for the future. I say that because there are not many jobs today that do not require some knowledge of how to use technology. Even the simple ones like working for McDonald's or other fast food or grocery stores.

In my opinion, technology is the most important subject that can be taught today because it is the future. It is literally in our everyday lives, and we use it everyday all the time.

If you don't believe me ask all the people who have been hacked and lost bank accounts, social media accounts, game accounts, and even worse had their identities stolen right out from under them.

In my opinion, technology is the most important subject that can be taught today because it is the future. It is literally in our everyday lives, and we use it everyday all the time. It is important to know how to use it and how it works. So it also helps to teach how to use it safely, because security is a big deal today. If you don't believe me ask all the people who have been hacked and lost bank accounts, social media accounts, game accounts, and even worse had their identities stolen right out from under them. That happens because some people do not understand technology, and how to use it properly and safely. 

Learning technology also helps set a person up for the future. I say that because there are not many jobs today that do not require some knowledge of how to use technology. Even the simple ones like working for McDonald's or other fast food or grocery stores.

Learning Technology can lead to even greater careers in peoples lives like being a computer programmer, a game developer, AI developer, scientist, engineer, doctor, and all those other kinds of high end paying jobs.

In my opinion, technology is the most important subject that can be taught today because it is the future. It is literally in our everyday lives, and we use it everyday all the time. It is important to know how to use it and how it works. So it also helps to teach how to use it safely, because security is a big deal today. If you don't believe me ask all the people who have been hacked and lost bank accounts, social media accounts, game accounts, and even worse had their identities stolen right out from under them. That happens because some people do not understand technology, and how to use it properly and safely. 

Learning technology also helps set a person up for the future. I say that because there are not many jobs today that do not require some knowledge of how to use technology. Even the simple ones like working for McDonald's or other fast food or grocery stores.

Learning Technology can lead to even greater careers in peoples lives like being a computer programmer, a game developer, AI developer, scientist, engineer, doctor, and all those other kinds of high end paying jobs.

In my opinion, technology is the most important subject that can be taught today because it is the future. It is literally in our everyday lives, and we use it everyday all the time.

That happens because some people do not understand technology, and how to use it properly and safely. 

Learning technology also helps set a person up for the future. I say that because there are not many jobs today that do not require some knowledge of how to use technology. Even the simple ones like working for McDonald's or other fast food or grocery stores.

Learning Technology can lead to even greater careers in peoples lives like being a computer programmer, a game developer, AI developer, scientist, engineer, doctor, and all those other kinds of high end paying jobs.

In my opinion, technology is the most important subject that can be taught today because it is the future. It is literally in our everyday lives, and we use it everyday all the time. It is important to know how to use it and how it works. So it also helps to teach how to use it safely, because security is a big deal today. If you don't believe me ask all the people who have been hacked and lost bank accounts, social media accounts, game accounts, and even worse had their identities stolen right out from under them. That happens because some people do not understand technology, and how to use it properly and safely. 

Learning technology also helps set a person up for the future. I say that because there are not many jobs today that do not require some knowledge of how to use technology. Even the simple ones like working for McDonald's or other fast food or grocery stores.

Learning Technology can lead to even greater careers in peoples lives like being a computer programmer, a game developer, AI developer, scientist, engineer, doctor, and all those other kinds of high end paying jobs. 
Learning technology is also important because it helps people learn how to think outside the box.
 It can help you sharpen your problem solving skills. It can help you learn how to think logically and rationally, because you have to think like that to understand how computers work.

In my opinion, technology is the most important subject that can be taught today because it is the future. It is literally in our everyday lives, and we use it everyday all the time. It is important to know how to use it and how it works. So it also helps to teach how to use it safely, because security is a big deal today. If you don't believe me ask all the people who have been hacked and lost bank accounts, social media accounts, game accounts, and even worse had their identities stolen right out from under them. That happens because some people do not understand technology, and how to use it properly and safely. 

Learning technology also helps set a person up for the future. I say that because there are not many jobs today that do not require some knowledge of how to use technology. Even the simple ones like working for McDonald's or other fast food or grocery stores.

Learning Technology can lead to even greater careers in peoples lives like being a computer programmer, a game developer, AI developer, scientist, engineer, doctor, and all those other kinds of high end paying jobs. 
Learning technology is also important because it helps people learn how to think outside the box.
 It can help you sharpen your problem solving skills. It can help you learn how to think logically and rationally, because you have to think like that to understand how computers work.

Technology is only growing more and more prominent in our lives, and isn't going away any time soon. So that is why I think that it is the most important to learn in school. Learn ",1889,[],0,1,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1498
