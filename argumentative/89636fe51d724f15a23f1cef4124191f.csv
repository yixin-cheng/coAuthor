The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the best things that humans do is adapt. This, I feel, is just another step in our evolution.  e are now in a time where we have to adapt to the digital world.
 It was going to happen at some point in time. It's just that COVID-19 really sped up the process to an almost all digital screen time.
I personally think that we should embrace the digital world and use it to our advantage.
 I think we are, for the most part, also safer that way at the same time. Not to mention , we can now connect with people from all over the world much easier than we really tried to before hand. That has it's own benefits in itself. 

It allows us to better self manage our own lives as well, if we have the privilege's of being able to work from home. Examples would be , being able to take care of our children, or even just being able to work from home and not have to worry about the commute, and less stress and pressure from the work place.

We had already started to go in this direction of a lot of screen time, except nobody really thought about it. It was just a natural progression of the digital age. Like I said before though, it helps to keep us safe from the harsh realities of things like pandemics. 

I think people should embrace this next step in our evolution, instead of condemning it, because it was already starting to happen. Almost everyone carried around a screen (smartphone) in their pockets that they always were looking at anyways on the outside.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, the best things that humans do is adapt. This, I feel, is just another step in our evolution.  e are now in a time where we have to adapt to the digital world.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the best things that humans do is adapt. This, I feel, is just another step in our evolution.  e are now in a time where we have to adapt to the digital world.
 It was going to happen at some point in time. It's just that COVID-19 really sped up the process to an almost all digital screen time.
I personally think that we should embrace the digital world and use it to our advantage.

It allows us to better self manage our own lives as well, if we have the privilege's of being able to work from home. Examples would be , being able to take care of our children, or even just being able to work from home and not have to worry about the commute, and less stress and pressure from the work place.

We had already started to go in this direction of a lot of screen time, except nobody really thought about it. It was just a natural progression of the digital age. Like I said before though, it helps to keep us safe from the harsh realities of things like pandemics. 

I think people should embrace this next step in our evolution, instead of condemning it, because it was already starting to happen. Almost everyone carried around a screen (smartphone) in their pockets that they always were looking at anyways on the outside.

 It was going to happen at some point in time. It's just that COVID-19 really sped up the process to an almost all digital screen time.
I personally think that we should embrace the digital world and use it to our advantage.
 I think we are, for the most part, also safer that way at the same time. Not to mention , we can now connect with people from all over the world much easier than we really tried to before hand. That has it's own benefits in itself. 

It allows us to better self manage our own lives as well, if we have the privilege's of being able to work from home. Examples would be , being able to take care of our children, or even just being able to work from home and not have to worry about the commute, and less stress and pressure from the work place.

We had already started to go in this direction of a lot of screen time, except nobody really thought about it. It was just a natural progression of the digital age. Like I said before though, it helps to keep us safe from the harsh realities of things like pandemics. 

I think people should embrace this next step in our evolution, instead of condemning it, because it was already starting to happen. Almost everyone carried around a screen (smartphone) in their pockets that they always were looking at anyways on the outside. So what is the difference if we are using it inside our homes more often. 
We are already in a time where we are more connected to each other than ever before.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?
