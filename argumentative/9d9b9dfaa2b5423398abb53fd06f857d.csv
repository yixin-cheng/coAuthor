I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university.

There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life. I learned about how to compose a proper resume for a variety of different job positions, which is a skill that everyone will need to do. We also",1546,[],0,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1167

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life. I learned about how to compose a proper resume for a variety of different job positions, which is a skill that everyone will need to do.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own.

They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life. I learned about how to compose a proper resume for a variety of different job positions, which is a skill that everyone will need to do. We also went over general job interview strategies. These things certainly prepared me for my career after college. I think a lot of people who have graduated from high school don't know how to create a professional looking resume or how to properly conduct themselves in an interview so people who did not learn these things in college will be lost.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life. I learned about how to compose a proper resume for a variety of different job positions, which is a skill that everyone will need to do. We also went over general job interview strategies. These things certainly prepared me for my career after college. I think a lot of people who have graduated from high school don't know how to create a professional looking resume or how to properly conduct themselves in an interview so people who did not learn these things in college will be lost.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life. I learned about how to compose a proper resume for a variety of different job positions, which is a skill that everyone will need to do. We also went over general job interview strategies. These things certainly prepared me for my career after college. I think a lot of people who have graduated from high school don't know how to create a professional looking resume or how to properly conduct themselves in an interview so people who did not learn these things in college will be lost.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life. I learned about how to compose a proper resume for a variety of different job positions, which is a skill that everyone will need to do. We also went over general job interview strategies. These things certainly prepared me for my career after college. I think a lot of people who have graduated from high school don't know how to create a professional looking resume or how to properly conduct themselves in an interview so people who did not learn these things in college will be lost. I was surprised to find out that not many of my peers got the same interview knowledge I did in their classes. Something like that should be required for all students.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life. I learned about how to compose a proper resume for a variety of different job positions, which is a skill that everyone will need to do. We also went over general job interview strategies. These things certainly prepared me for my career after college. I think a lot of people who have graduated from high school don't know how to create a professional looking resume or how to properly conduct themselves in an interview so people who did not learn these things in college will be lost. I was surprised to find out that not many of my peers got the same interview knowledge I did in their classes. Something like that should be required for all students.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life. I learned about how to compose a proper resume for a variety of different job positions, which is a skill that everyone will need to do. We also went over general job interview strategies. These things certainly prepared me for my career after college. I think a lot of people who have graduated from high school don't know how to create a professional looking resume or how to properly conduct themselves in an interview so people who did not learn these things in college will be lost. I was surprised to find out that not many of my peers got the same interview knowledge I did in their classes. Something like that should be required for all students.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life. I learned about how to compose a proper resume for a variety of different job positions, which is a skill that everyone will need to do. We also went over general job interview strategies. These things certainly prepared me for my career after college.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life. I learned about how to compose a proper resume for a variety of different job positions, which is a skill that everyone will need to do. We also went over general job interview strategies. These things certainly prepared me for my career after college. I think a lot of people who have graduated from high school don't know how to create a professional looking resume or how to properly conduct themselves in an interview so people who did not learn these things in college will be lost. I was surprised to find out that not many of my peers got the same interview knowledge I did in their classes. Something like that should be required for all students. Life lessons will be more important than knowing all of the organs in the digestive system for almost everyone. I really should have learned job skills like this when I was in high school, and not in college in an elective course.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life. I learned about how to compose a proper resume for a variety of different job positions, which is a skill that everyone will need to do. We also went over general job interview strategies. These things certainly prepared me for my career after college. I think a lot of people who have graduated from high school don't know how to create a professional looking resume or how to properly conduct themselves in an interview so people who did not learn these things in college will be lost. I was surprised to find out that not many of my peers got the same interview knowledge I did in their classes. Something like that should be required for all students. Life lessons will be more important than knowing all of the organs in the digestive system for almost everyone. I really should have learned job skills like this when I was in high school, and not in college in an elective course.

I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life. I learned about how to compose a proper resume for a variety of different job positions, which is a skill that everyone will need to do. We also went over general job interview strategies. These things certainly prepared me for my career after college. I think a lot of people who have graduated from high school don't know how to create a professional looking resume or how to properly conduct themselves in an interview so people who did not learn these things in college will be lost. I was surprised to find out that not many of my peers got the same interview knowledge I did in their classes. Something like that should be required for all students. Life lessons will be more important than knowing all of the organs in the digestive system for almost everyone. I really should have learned job skills like this when I was in high school, and not in college in an elective course.

I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life. I learned about how to compose a proper resume for a variety of different job positions, which is a skill that everyone will need to do. We also went over general job interview strategies. These things certainly prepared me for my career after college. I think a lot of people who have graduated from high school don't know how to create a professional looking resume or how to properly conduct themselves in an interview so people who did not learn these things in college will be lost. I was surprised to find out that not many of my peers got the same interview knowledge I did in their classes. Something like that should be required for all students. Life lessons will be more important than knowing all of the organs in the digestive system for almost everyone. I really should have learned job skills like this when I was in high school, and not in college in an elective course.

They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life. I learned about how to compose a proper resume for a variety of different job positions, which is a skill that everyone will need to do. We also went over general job interview strategies. These things certainly prepared me for my career after college. I think a lot of people who have graduated from high school don't know how to create a professional looking resume or how to properly conduct themselves in an interview so people who did not learn these things in college will be lost. I was surprised to find out that not many of my peers got the same interview knowledge I did in their classes. Something like that should be required for all students. Life lessons will be more important than knowing all of the organs in the digestive system for almost everyone. I really should have learned job skills like this when I was in high school, and not in college in an elective course.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life. I learned about how to compose a proper resume for a variety of different job positions, which is a skill that everyone will need to do. We also went over general job interview strategies. These things certainly prepared me for my career after college. I think a lot of people who have graduated from high school don't know how to create a professional looking resume or how to properly conduct themselves in an interview so people who did not learn these things in college will be lost. I was surprised to find out that not many of my peers got the same interview knowledge I did in their classes. Something like that should be required for all students. Life lessons will be more important than knowing all of the organs in the digestive system for almost everyone. I really should have learned job skills like this when I was in high school, and not in college in an elective course.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life. I learned about how to compose a proper resume for a variety of different job positions, which is a skill that everyone will need to do. We also went over general job interview strategies. These things certainly prepared me for my career after college. I think a lot of people who have graduated from high school don't know how to create a professional looking resume or how to properly conduct themselves in an interview so people who did not learn these things in college will be lost. I was surprised to find out that not many of my peers got the same interview knowledge I did in their classes. Something like that should be required for all students. Life lessons will be more important than knowing all of the organs in the digestive system for almost everyone.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life. I learned about how to compose a proper resume for a variety of different job positions, which is a skill that everyone will need to do. We also went over general job interview strategies. These things certainly prepared me for my career after college. I think a lot of people who have graduated from high school don't know how to create a professional looking resume or how to properly conduct themselves in an interview so people who did not learn these things in college will be lost. I was surprised to find out that not many of my peers got the same interview knowledge I did in their classes. Something like that should be required for all students. Life lessons will be more important than knowing all of the organs in the digestive system for almost everyone.

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life. I learned about how to compose a proper resume for a variety of different job positions, which is a skill that everyone will need to do. We also went over general job interview strategies. These things certainly prepared me for my career after college. I think a lot of people who have graduated from high school don't know how to create a professional looking resume or how to properly conduct themselves in an interview so people who did not learn these things in college will be lost. I was surprised to find out that not many of my peers got the same interview knowledge I did in their classes. Something like that should be required for all students. Life lessons will be more important than knowing all of the organs in the digestive system for almost everyone. I really should have learned job skills like this when I was in high school, and not in college in an elective course. 

The education system needs to be radically rethought so that everyone has a fair shot at success after they graduate from high school. If the system doesn't change, a lot of students will be left behind. ",2495,[],0,1,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1967
