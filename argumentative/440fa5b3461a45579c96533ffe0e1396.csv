In my opinion, we shouldn't be overly worried about screen time. Yes, it's not good to be attached to a screen 24/7 but most people aren't glued to a screen every single second of the day because they have other things to do. 
The important thing is to be aware of how much screen time you're getting and to make sure you're not spending too much time on your
 screen at one time. I'd say as long as everyone takes a break to ease the strain from looking at a screen at least once every day, then we'll be fine.

I think it's time we get comfortable and embrace technology because it's not going to go anywhere and technology really makes our lives so much easier in many ways. Excessive screen time can definitely strain your eyes and cause stress, but I think we'll be fine as long as we take breaks and don't spend too much time on our screens.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we shouldn't be overly worried about screen time. Yes, it's not good to be attached to a screen 24/7 but most people aren't glued to a screen every single second of the day because they have other things to do. 
The important thing is to be aware of how much screen time you're getting and to make sure you're not spending too much time on your

In my opinion, we shouldn't be overly worried about screen time. Yes, it's not good to be attached to a screen 24/7 but most people aren't glued to a screen every single second of the day because they have other things to do.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't be overly worried about screen time. Yes, it's not good to be attached to a screen 24/7 but most people aren't glued to a screen every single second of the day because they have other things to do. 
The important thing is to be aware of how much screen time you're getting and to make sure you're not spending too much time on your
 screen at one time. I'd say as long as everyone takes a break to ease the strain from looking at a screen at least once every day, then we'll be fine. 

I think it's time we get comfortable and embrace technology because it's not going to go anywhere and technology really makes our lives so much easier in many ways. We can look up information we need quickly, it's convenient to look up something on your phone while you are out shopping. 

Technology is helpful in so many ways there's really no reason why we should be worried about spending too much time on screens besides for our eyes getting strained.

Excessive screen time can definitely strain your eyes and cause stress, but I think we'll be fine as long as we take breaks and don't spend too much time on our screens. jdjdjdj

In my opinion, we shouldn't be overly worried about screen time. Yes, it's not good to be attached to a screen 24/7 but most people aren't glued to a screen every single second of the day because they have other things to do. 
The important thing is to be aware of how much screen time you're getting and to make sure you're not spending too much time on your
 screen at one time. I'd say as long as everyone takes a break to ease the strain from looking at a screen at least once every day, then we'll be fine. 

I think it's time we get comfortable and embrace technology because it's not going to go anywhere and technology really makes our lives so much easier in many ways. We can look up information we need quickly, it's convenient to look up something on your phone while you are out shopping. 

Technology is helpful in so many ways there's really no reason why we should be worried about spending too much time on screens besides for our eyes getting strained.

To conclude: Excessive screen time can definitely strain your eyes and cause stress, but I think we'll be fine as long as we take periodic breaks each day and don't spend too much time on our screens.

In my opinion, we shouldn't be overly worried about screen time. Yes, it's not good to be attached to a screen 24/7 but most people aren't glued to a screen every single second of the day because they have other things to do.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't be overly worried about screen time. Yes, it's not good to be attached to a screen 24/7 but most people aren't glued to a screen every single second of the day because they have other things to do. 
The important thing is to be aware of how much screen time you're getting and to make sure you're not spending too much time on your
 screen at one time. I'd say as long as everyone takes a break to ease the strain from looking at a screen at least once every day, then we'll be fine. 

I think it's time we get comfortable and embrace technology because it's not going to go anywhere and technology really makes our lives so much easier in many ways. We can look up information we need quickly, it's convenient to look up something on your phone while you are out shopping. 

Technology is helpful in so many ways there's really no reason why we should be worried about spending too much time on screens besides for our eyes getting strained.

To conclude: Excessive screen time can definitely strain your eyes and cause stress, but I think we'll be fine as long as we take periodic breaks each day and don't spend too much time on our screens. If we take periodic breaks we will be fine.
