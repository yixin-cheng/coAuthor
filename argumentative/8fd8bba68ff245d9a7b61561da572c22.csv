In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.

I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we ",1519,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1482

I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a seri",1538,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1501

However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that w",1557,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1520

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.  My classmates judged those papers very ",1681,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1754

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.  My classmates judged those papers very harshly.  The papers that",1706,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1789

I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.  My classmates judged those papers very harshly.  I learned that if I wanted to be successful, I had to think outside of the box.  When ",1777,[],1,1,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1823

However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.  My classmates judged those papers very harshly.  I learned that if I wanted to be successful, I had to think outside of the box.

However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.  My classmates judged those papers very harshly.  I learned that if I wanted to be successful, I had to think outside of the box.  When I took more risks with my writing, my classmates responded m",1837,[],1,1,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1905

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.  My classmates judged those papers very harshly.  I learned that if I wanted to be successful, I had to think outside of the box.

I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.  My classmates judged those papers very harshly.  I learned that if I wanted to be successful, I had to think outside of the box.  When I took more risks with my writing, my classmates responded much more favorably.

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.  My classmates judged those papers very harshly.  I learned that if I wanted to be successful, I had to think outside of the box.  When I took more risks with my writing, my classmates responded much more favorably.

However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.  My classmates judged those papers very harshly.  I learned that if I wanted to be successful, I had to think outside of the box.  When I took more risks with my writing, my classmates responded much more favorably.

I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.  My classmates judged those papers very harshly.  I learned that if I wanted to be successful, I had to think outside of the box.  When I took more risks with my writing, my classmates responded much more favorably.  

With discipline and creativity, I think you can accomplish many great things in your life.  I do believe that these valuable lessons helped me to achieve a lot in my life.  I also believe these two skills will",2069,[],1,1,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,2137

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.  My classmates judged those papers very harshly.  I learned that if I wanted to be successful, I had to think outside of the box.  When I took more risks with my writing, my classmates responded much more favorably.

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.  My classmates judged those papers very harshly.  I learned that if I wanted to be successful, I had to think outside of the box.  When I took more risks with my writing, my classmates responded much more favorably.  

With discipline and creativity, I think you can accomplish many great things in your life.  I do believe that these valuable lessons helped me to achieve a lot in my life.  I also believe these two skills will continue to benefit me as I get older.  ",2110,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,2181

However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.  My classmates judged those papers very harshly.  I learned that if I wanted to be successful, I had to think outside of the box.  When I took more risks with my writing, my classmates responded much more favorably.  

With discipline and creativity, I think you can accomplish many great things in your life.  I do believe that these valuable lessons helped me to achieve a lot in my life.  I also believe these two skills will continue to benefit me as I get older.  Life  I hope that my children will learn these valuable lessons in school.  ",2114,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,2195

I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.  My classmates judged those papers very harshly.  I learned that if I wanted to be successful, I had to think outside of the box.  When I took more risks with my writing, my classmates responded much more favorably.  

With discipline and creativity, I think you can accomplish many great things in your life.  I do believe that these valuable lessons helped me to achieve a lot in my life.  I also believe these two skills will continue to benefit me as I get older.  Life will always t  I hope that my children will learn these valuable lessons in school.

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.  My classmates judged those papers very harshly.  I learned that if I wanted to be successful, I had to think outside of the box.  When I took more risks with my writing, my classmates responded much more favorably.  

With discipline and creativity, I think you can accomplish many great things in your life.  I do believe that these valuable lessons helped me to achieve a lot in my life.  I also believe these two skills will continue to benefit me as I get older.  Life will always throw problems   I hope that my children will learn these valuable lessons in school.

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.  My classmates judged those papers very harshly.  I learned that if I wanted to be successful, I had to think outside of the box.  When I took more risks with my writing, my classmates responded much more favorably.  

With discipline and creativity, I think you can accomplish many great things in your life.  I do believe that these valuable lessons helped me to achieve a lot in my life.  I also believe these two skills will continue to benefit me as I get older.  Life will always throw problems at you that yo  I hope that my children will learn these valuable lessons in school.

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.

I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.  My classmates judged those papers very harshly.  I learned that if I wanted to be successful, I had to think outside of the box.  When I took more risks with my writing, my classmates responded much more favorably.  

With discipline and creativity, I think you can accomplish many great things in your life.  I do believe that these valuable lessons helped me to achieve a lot in my life.  I also believe these two skills will continue to benefit me as I get older.

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.  My classmates judged those papers very harshly.  I learned that if I wanted to be successful, I had to think outside of the box.  When I took more risks with my writing, my classmates responded much more favorably.  

With discipline and creativity, I think you can accomplish many great things in your life.  I do believe that these valuable lessons helped me to achieve a lot in my life.  I also believe these two skills will continue to benefit me as I get older.  Life will always throw problems at you that you haven't experienced.  Disciplin  I hope that my children will learn these valuable lessons in school.  ",2189,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,2278

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.  My classmates judged those papers very harshly.  I learned that if I wanted to be successful, I had to think outside of the box.

I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.  My classmates judged those papers very harshly.  I learned that if I wanted to be successful, I had to think outside of the box.  When I took more risks with my writing, my classmates responded much more favorably.  

With discipline and creativity, I think you can accomplish many great things in your life.  I do believe that these valuable lessons helped me to achieve a lot in my life.  I also believe these two skills will continue to benefit me as I get older.  Life will always throw problems at you that you haven't experienced.   I hope that my children will learn these valuable lessons in school.  ",942,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,2305

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.
