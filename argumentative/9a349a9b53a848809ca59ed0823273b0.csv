The most important thing students should learn in school is how to be independent. They should learn how to take care of themselves and not rely on others. They should also learn how to be responsible for their actions. 

School is the first time many children leave their parents for a meaningful period of time. It's the perfect opportunity to learn about independence, and to begin to be responsible.

Independence affects every aspect of our lives. It is important to be able to take care of yourself and not rely on others. If you can't do that, then you will have a hard time in life. You will have to rely on others for everything. You will repeatedly have to ask for help and you won't be able to do anything on your own. Your dependency will limit your enjoyment, restrict your options. 


esponsibility is also very important.
  You will learn about the consequences of your actions.  If you are responsible for your actions, then you will be able to learn from your mistakes and not make the same mistake twice, while having a real stake in the outcome. 

Teachers and adults should be teaching students how to be independent and responsible.   I learned how to be independent and responsible from my parents. They gave me chances to fail, so that I could learn. They taught me how to take care of myself and be responsible for my actions.  

I learned that asking for help is fine, but that there is a joyous freedom in being able to do things for yourself. 
Getting gifts is a good feeling, but being able to do things for yourself is a better feeling.  There's no comparison for the feeling of buying your first car, with money you've earned yourself.
