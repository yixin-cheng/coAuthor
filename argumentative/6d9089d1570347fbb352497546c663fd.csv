In my opinion, technology has made dating easier. Before technology I found it hard to date in a small town. Once I started looking online that all changed. I was able to find someone who lived in my area and had similar interests. It expanded my social circle. It wasn't always a love connection but I found friends I otherwise wouldn't have met before. 

I feel that people need technology to date at this point in life. It's a way to look without the risk of embarrassing yourself. You probably are too shy to approach a stranger on the street but you can message them and get to know them without the risk of rejection. It basically gives you the chance to be more social in general. 

I believe that it's good to explore your options online. What if the love of your life was in the next town? You'd never know it if it wasn't for dating apps. It just opens up your options.

In my opinion, technology has made dating easier. Before technology I found it hard to date in a small town. Once I started looking online that all changed. I was able to find someone who lived in my area and had similar interests. It expanded my social circle. It wasn't always a love connection but I found friends I otherwise wouldn't have met before.

In my opinion, technology has made dating easier. Before technology I found it hard to date in a small town. Once I started looking online that all changed. I was able to find someone who lived in my area and had similar interests. It expanded my social circle. It wasn't always a love connection but I found friends I otherwise wouldn't have met before. 

I feel that people need technology to date at this point in life. It's a way to look without the risk of embarrassing yourself. You probably are too shy to approach a stranger on the street but you can message them and get to know them without the risk of rejection. It basically gives you the chance to be more social in general. 

I believe that it's good to explore your options online. What if the love of your life was in the next town? You'd never know it if it wasn't for dating apps. It just opens up your options.

As long as you are safe and smart about it, I don't see anything wrong with using dating apps.

In my opinion, technology has made dating easier. Before technology I found it hard to date in a small town. Once I started looking online that all changed. I was able to find someone who lived in my area and had similar interests. It expanded my social circle. It wasn't always a love connection but I found friends I otherwise wouldn't have met before.

In my opinion, technology has made dating easier. Before technology I found it hard to date in a small town. Once I started looking online that all changed. I was able to find someone who lived in my area and had similar interests. It expanded my social circle. It wasn't always a love connection but I found friends I otherwise wouldn't have met before.

In my opinion, technology has made dating easier. Before technology I found it hard to date in a small town. Once I started looking online that all changed. I was able to find someone who lived in my area and had similar interests. It expanded my social circle. It wasn't always a love connection but I found friends I otherwise wouldn't have met before. 

I feel that people need technology to date at this point in life. It's a way to look without the risk of embarrassing yourself. You probably are too shy to approach a stranger on the street but you can message them and get to know them without the risk of rejection. It basically gives you the chance to be more social in general. 

I believe that it's good to explore your options online. What if the love of your life was in the next town? You'd never know it if it wasn't for dating apps. It just opens up your options.

As long as you are safe and smart about it, I don't see anything wrong with using dating apps. Like with all technology, you just have to be careful with who you interact with and what information you put out there. I think we all know those safety rules at this point though so they should be second nature. So just follow your instinct and give it a try. You really have nothing to lose and you may just find a new friend or the love of your life online. It's worth a shot, especially in these ",1742,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1461

In my opinion, technology has made dating easier. Before technology I found it hard to date in a small town. Once I started looking online that all changed. I was able to find someone who lived in my area and had similar interests. It expanded my social circle. It wasn't always a love connection but I found friends I otherwise wouldn't have met before. 

I feel that people need technology to date at this point in life. It's a way to look without the risk of embarrassing yourself. You probably are too shy to approach a stranger on the street but you can message them and get to know them without the risk of rejection. It basically gives you the chance to be more social in general. 

I believe that it's good to explore your options online. What if the love of your life was in the next town? You'd never know it if it wasn't for dating apps. It just opens up your options.

As long as you are safe and smart about it, I don't see anything wrong with using dating apps. Like with all technology, you just have to be careful with who you interact with and what information you put out there. I think we all know those safety rules at this point though so they should be second nature. So just follow your instinct and give it a try. You really have nothing to lose and you may just find a new friend or the love of your life online. It's worth a shot, especially in these lonely times of the pandemic.",1396,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1494

In my opinion, technology has made dating easier. Before technology I found it hard to date in a small town. Once I started looking online that all changed. I was able to find someone who lived in my area and had similar interests. It expanded my social circle. It wasn't always a love connection but I found friends I otherwise wouldn't have met before. 

I feel that people need technology to date at this point in life. It's a way to look without the risk of embarrassing yourself. You probably are too shy to approach a stranger on the street but you can message them and get to know them without the risk of rejection. It basically gives you the chance to be more social in general. 

I believe that it's good to explore your options online. What if the love of your life was in the next town? You'd never know it if it wasn't for dating apps. It just opens up your options.

As long as you are safe and smart about it, I don't see anything wrong with using dating apps. Like with all technology, you just have to be careful with who you interact with and what information you put out there. I think we all know those safety rules at this point though so they should be second nature. So just follow your instinct and give it a try.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has made dating easier. Before technology I found it hard to date in a small town. Once I started looking online that all changed. I was able to find someone who lived in my area and had similar interests. It expanded my social circle. It wasn't always a love connection but I found friends I otherwise wouldn't have met before. 

I feel that people need technology to date at this point in life. It's a way to look without the risk of embarrassing yourself. You probably are too shy to approach a stranger on the street but you can message them and get to know them without the risk of rejection. It basically gives you the chance to be more social in general. 

I believe that it's good to explore your options online. What if the love of your life was in the next town? You'd never know it if it wasn't for dating apps. It just opens up your options.

As long as you are safe and smart about it, I don't see anything wrong with using dating apps. Like with all technology, you just have to be careful with who you interact with and what information you put out there. I think we all know those safety rules at this point though so they should be second nature. So just follow your instinct and give it a try. You really have nothing to lose and you may just find a new friend or the love of your life online. It's worth a shot, especially in these lonely times of the pandemic.",1486,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1544
