In my opinion, not keeping up with the news does not make you a bad person. Now keeping up with the news does make you slightly better but doesn't mean that you are bad if you don't. I think some people don't want to know what is going on and wants to keep up with their own lives and focus on that. And I don't think that is a bad thing at all. As long as they aren't doing anything harmful then they are a perfectly fine citizen in my book. I think a lot of us anyways see what happens on the news and don't do anything different anyways. Which I feel is the same as not knowing what is happening at all. 

I do think it is good to be informed though. I wouldn't go as far as to say we have a responsibility as citizens to know what is going on but it isn't bad at all to watch the news. Not only would it make you informed but also may make you do something like donate to a group. But in the end, it isn't your responsibility and you shouldn't feel bad if you don't live politically.

I think some people don't want to know what is going on and wants to keep up with their own lives and focus on that. And I don't think that is a bad thing at all. As long as they aren't doing anything harmful then they are a perfectly fine citizen in my book. I think a lot of us anyways see what happens on the news and don't do anything different anyways. Which I feel is the same as not knowing what is happening at all. 

I do think it is good to be informed though. I wouldn't go as far as to say we have a responsibility as citizens to know what is going on but it isn't bad at all to watch the news. Not only would it make you informed but also may make you do something like donate to a group. But in the end, it isn't your responsibility and you shouldn't feel bad if you don't live politically. I would even argue now it is almost better to not like politically or at least make it known about your politics.

I think some people don't want to know what is going on and wants to keep up with their own lives and focus on that. And I don't think that is a bad thing at all. As long as they aren't doing anything harmful then they are a perfectly fine citizen in my book. I think a lot of us anyways see what happens on the news and don't do anything different anyways. Which I feel is the same as not knowing what is happening at all. 

I do think it is good to be informed though. I wouldn't go as far as to say we have a responsibility as citizens to know what is going on but it isn't bad at all to watch the news. Not only would it make you informed but also may make you do something like donate to a group. But in the end, it isn't your responsibility and you shouldn't feel bad if you don't live politically. I would even argue now it is almost better to not like politically or at least make it known about your politics.

I think some people don't want to know what is going on and wants to keep up with their own lives and focus on that. And I don't think that is a bad thing at all. As long as they aren't doing anything harmful then they are a perfectly fine citizen in my book. I think a lot of us anyways see what happens on the news and don't do anything different anyways. Which I feel is the same as not knowing what is happening at all. 

I do think it is good to be informed though. I wouldn't go as far as to say we have a responsibility as citizens to know what is going on but it isn't bad at all to watch the news. Not only would it make you informed but also may make you do something like donate to a group. But in the end, it isn't your responsibility and you shouldn't feel bad if you don't live politically. I would even argue now it is almost better to not like politically or at least make it known about your politics.

I do think it is good to be informed though. I wouldn't go as far as to say we have a responsibility as citizens to know what is going on but it isn't bad at all to watch the news. Not only would it make you informed but also may make you do something like donate to a group. But in the end, it isn't your responsibility and you shouldn't feel bad if you don't live politically. I would even argue now it is almost better to not like politically or at least make it known about your politics.

In my opinion, not keeping up with the news does not make you a bad person. Now keeping up with the news does make you slightly better but doesn't mean that you are bad if you don't. I think some people don't want to know what is going on and wants to keep up with their own lives and focus on that. And I don't think that is a bad thing at all. As long as they aren't doing anything harmful then they are a perfectly fine citizen in my book. I think a lot of us anyways see what happens on the news and don't do anything different anyways. Which I feel is the same as not knowing what is happening at all. 

I do think it is good to be informed though. I wouldn't go as far as to say we have a responsibility as citizens to know what is going on but it isn't bad at all to watch the news. Not only would it make you informed but also may make you do something like donate to a group. But in the end, it isn't your responsibility and you shouldn't feel bad if you don't live politically.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, not keeping up with the news does not make you a bad person. Now keeping up with the news does make you slightly better but doesn't mean that you are bad if you don't. I think some people don't want to know what is going on and wants to keep up with their own lives and focus on that. And I don't think that is a bad thing at all. As long as they aren't doing anything harmful then they are a perfectly fine citizen in my book. I think a lot of us anyways see what happens on the news and don't do anything different anyways. Which I feel is the same as not knowing what is happening at all. 

I do think it is good to be informed though. I wouldn't go as far as to say we have a responsibility as citizens to know what is going on but it isn't bad at all to watch the news. Not only would it make you informed but also may make you do something like donate to a group. But in the end, it isn't your responsibility and you shouldn't feel bad if you don't live politically. I would even argue now it is almost better to not like politically or at least make it known about your politics.

In my opinion, not keeping up with the news does not make you a bad person. Now keeping up with the news does make you slightly better but doesn't mean that you are bad if you don't. I think some people don't want to know what is going on and wants to keep up with their own lives and focus on that. And I don't think that is a bad thing at all. As long as they aren't doing anything harmful then they are a perfectly fine citizen in my book. I think a lot of us anyways see what happens on the news and don't do anything different anyways. Which I feel is the same as not knowing what is happening at all. 

I do think it is good to be informed though. I wouldn't go as far as to say we have a responsibility as citizens to know what is going on but it isn't bad at all to watch the news. Not only would it make you informed but also may make you do something like donate to a group. But in the end, it isn't your responsibility and you shouldn't feel bad if you don't live politically. I would even argue now it is almost better to not like politically or at least make it known about your politics. The topic of politics have been getting bad with Trump losing, vaccines, and wearing masks. And people get a lot of their political information from the news. Some people have a favorite news station that is usually biased to one side of the spectrum. And that doesn't do good as a country to have people rely on one station for all their information.

In my opinion, not keeping up with the news does not make you a bad person. Now keeping up with the news does make you slightly better but doesn't mean that you are bad if you don't. I think some people don't want to know what is going on and wants to keep up with their own lives and focus on that. And I don't think that is a bad thing at all. As long as they aren't doing anything harmful then they are a perfectly fine citizen in my book. I think a lot of us anyways see what happens on the news and don't do anything different anyways. Which I feel is the same as not knowing what is happening at all. 

I do think it is good to be informed though. I wouldn't go as far as to say we have a responsibility as citizens to know what is going on but it isn't bad at all to watch the news. Not only would it make you informed but also may make you do something like donate to a group. But in the end, it isn't your responsibility and you shouldn't feel bad if you don't live politically. I would even argue now it is almost better to not like politically or at least make it known about your politics. The topic of politics have been getting bad with Trump losing, vaccines, and wearing masks. And people get a lot of their political information from the news.

In my opinion, not keeping up with the news does not make you a bad person. Now keeping up with the news does make you slightly better but doesn't mean that you are bad if you don't.

I do think it is good to be informed though. I wouldn't go as far as to say we have a responsibility as citizens to know what is going on but it isn't bad at all to watch the news. Not only would it make you informed but also may make you do something like donate to a group. But in the end, it isn't your responsibility and you shouldn't feel bad if you don't live politically.

In my opinion, not keeping up with the news does not make you a bad person. Now keeping up with the news does make you slightly better but doesn't mean that you are bad if you don't. I think some people don't want to know what is going on and wants to keep up with their own lives and focus on that. And I don't think that is a bad thing at all. As long as they aren't doing anything harmful then they are a perfectly fine citizen in my book. I think a lot of us anyways see what happens on the news and don't do anything different anyways. Which I feel is the same as not knowing what is happening at all. 

I do think it is good to be informed though. I wouldn't go as far as to say we have a responsibility as citizens to know what is going on but it isn't bad at all to watch the news. Not only would it make you informed but also may make you do something like donate to a group. But in the end, it isn't your responsibility and you shouldn't feel bad if you don't live politically. I would even argue now it is almost better to not like politically or at least make it known about your politics. The topic of politics have been getting bad with Trump losing, vaccines, and wearing masks. And people get a lot of their political information from the news.

In my opinion, not keeping up with the news does not make you a bad person. Now keeping up with the news does make you slightly better but doesn't mean that you are bad if you don't. I think some people don't want to know what is going on and wants to keep up with their own lives and focus on that. And I don't think that is a bad thing at all. As long as they aren't doing anything harmful then they are a perfectly fine citizen in my book. I think a lot of us anyways see what happens on the news and don't do anything different anyways. Which I feel is the same as not knowing what is happening at all. 

I do think it is good to be informed though. I wouldn't go as far as to say we have a responsibility as citizens to know what is going on but it isn't bad at all to watch the news. Not only would it make you informed but also may make you do something like donate to a group. But in the end, it isn't your responsibility and you shouldn't feel bad if you don't live politically. I would even argue now it is almost better to not like politically or at least make it known about your politics. The topic of politics have been getting bad with Trump losing, vaccines, and wearing masks. And people get a lot of their political information from the news. Some people have a favorite news station that is usually biased to one side of the spectrum. And that doesn't do good as a country to have people rely on one station for all their information.
