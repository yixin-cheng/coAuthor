If one calls mountain climbing too dangerous then they are literally saying that it is reckless to climb a mountain. One cannot simply use the term reckless and make everyone agree on the same thing. We all have different standards. To assume we all think the same is not only arrogant, but is also an injustice against us as a free country with the freedom to be different.

One cannot simply call a sport, like mountain climbing, too dangerous to be considered a sport, without defining what is reckless about it.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it is arrogant and asinine to call any sport too dangerous to be considered a sport. This is the same type of argument that can be used to deny someone the freedom to travel, because traveling can have criminal consequences. The only thing that makes any sport dangerous, is when it is performed in a reckless manner. 

One cannot simply call a sport, like mountain climbing, too dangerous to be considered a sport, without defining what is reckless about it. If one calls mountain climbing too dangerous then they are literally saying that it is reckless to climb a mountain. One cannot simply use the term reckless and make everyone agree on the same thing. We all have different standards. To assume that we all think the same is not only arrogant, but is also an injustice against us as a free country with the freedom to be different.

Calling a sport too dangerous to be considered a sport is asinine because the definition of sport has changed over the years.   People in the past considered sports to be things like bullfighting and gladiator fighting; things that many would consider reckless by today's standards.  Hunting, fishing, javelin-throwing and archery all involved substantial risk.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it is arrogant and asinine to call any sport too dangerous to be considered a sport. This is the same type of argument that can be used to deny someone the freedom to travel, because traveling can have criminal consequences. The only thing that makes any sport dangerous, is when it is performed in a reckless manner. 

One cannot simply call a sport, like mountain climbing, too dangerous to be considered a sport, without defining what is reckless about it. If one calls mountain climbing too dangerous then they are literally saying that it is reckless to climb a mountain. One cannot simply use the term reckless and make everyone agree on the same thing. We all have different standards. To assume that we all think the same is not only arrogant, but is also an injustice against us as a free country with the freedom to be different.

Calling a sport too dangerous to be considered a sport is asinine because the definition of sport has changed over the years.   People in the past considered sports to be things like bullfighting and gladiator fighting; things that many would consider reckless by today's standards.  Hunting, fishing, javelin-throwing and archery all involved substantial risk.
