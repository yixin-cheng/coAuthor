In my opinion, I absolutely do not believe schools should provide free pads and/or tampons to girls because that would only add to the shame, embarrassment, and bullying of these girls. That alone would solve the major problems of period shaming in schools because it would not be an issue of other students shaming these girls anymore. The schools should use their budget for more educational things, and providing free lunches anyways. It would cut back dramatically on the costs for the schools anyways. 
I believe that if students want to buy pads and tampons, they should be able to do so., and that there should be other forms of government assistance for these families that need the help in that area.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, I absolutely do not believe schools should provide free pads and/or tampons to girls because that would only add to the shame, embarrassment, and bullying of these girls.

That alone would solve the major problems of period shaming in schools because it would not be an issue of other students shaming these girls anymore. The schools should use their budget for more educational things, and providing free lunches anyways. It would cut back dramatically on the costs for the schools anyways. 
I believe that if students want to buy pads and tampons, they should be able to do so., and that there should be other forms of government assistance for these families that need the help in that area. Other students in school would never know about it either, which gives the bullies less ammo to use against students in poverty. Obviously because the people that need it would be able to buy pads and tampons in a more private way.

In my opinion, I absolutely do not believe schools should provide free pads and/or tampons to girls because that would only add to the shame, embarrassment, and bullying of these girls. That alone would solve the major problems of period shaming in schools because it would not be an issue of other students shaming these girls anymore. The schools should use their budget for more educational things, and providing free lunches anyways. It would cut back dramatically on the costs for the schools anyways.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, I absolutely do not believe schools should provide free pads and/or tampons to girls because that would only add to the shame, embarrassment, and bullying of these girls. That alone would solve the major problems of period shaming in schools because it would not be an issue of other students shaming these girls anymore. The schools should use their budget for more educational things, and providing free lunches anyways. It would cut back dramatically on the costs for the schools anyways. 
I believe that if students want to buy pads and tampons, they should be able to do so., and that there should be other forms of government assistance for these families that need the help in that area. Other students in school would never know about it either, which gives the bullies less ammo to use against students in poverty.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, I absolutely do not believe schools should provide free pads and/or tampons to girls because that would only add to the shame, embarrassment, and bullying of these girls. That alone would solve the major problems of period shaming in schools because it would not be an issue of other students shaming these girls anymore. The schools should use their budget for more educational things, and providing free lunches anyways. It would cut back dramatically on the costs for the schools anyways. 
I believe that if students want to buy pads and tampons, they should be able to do so., and that there should be other forms of government assistance for these families that need the help in that area. Other students in school would never know about it either, which gives the bullies less ammo to use against students in poverty. Obviously because the people that need it would be able to buy pads and tampons in a more private way.

In my opinion, I absolutely do not believe schools should provide free pads and/or tampons to girls because that would only add to the shame, embarrassment, and bullying of these girls. That alone would solve the major problems of period shaming in schools because it would not be an issue of other students shaming these girls anymore. The schools should use their budget for more educational things, and providing free lunches anyways. It would cut back dramatically on the costs for the schools anyways. 
I believe that if students want to buy pads and tampons, they should be able to do so., and that there should be other forms of government assistance for these families that need the help in that area. Other students in school would never know about it either, which gives the bullies less ammo to use against students in poverty.

In my opinion, I absolutely do not believe schools should provide free pads and/or tampons to girls because that would only add to the shame, embarrassment, and bullying of these girls. That alone would solve the major problems of period shaming in schools because it would not be an issue of other students shaming these girls anymore. The schools should use their budget for more educational things, and providing free lunches anyways. It would cut back dramatically on the costs for the schools anyways. 
I believe that if students want to buy pads and tampons, they should be able to do so., and that there should be other forms of government assistance for these families that need the help in that area. Other students in school would never know about it either, which gives the bullies less ammo to use against students in poverty.

In my opinion, I absolutely do not believe schools should provide free pads and/or tampons to girls because that would only add to the shame, embarrassment, and bullying of these girls. That alone would solve the major problems of period shaming in schools because it would not be an issue of other students shaming these girls anymore. The schools should use their budget for more educational things, and providing free lunches anyways. It would cut back dramatically on the costs for the schools anyways. 
I believe that if students want to buy pads and tampons, they should be able to do so., and that there should be other forms of government assistance for these families that need the help in that area. Other students in school would never know about it either, which gives the bullies less ammo to use against students in poverty. Obviously because the people that need it would be able to buy pads and tampons in a more private way.

In my opinion, I absolutely do not believe schools should provide free pads and/or tampons to girls because that would only add to the shame, embarrassment, and bullying of these girls. That alone would solve the major problems of period shaming in schools because it would not be an issue of other students shaming these girls anymore.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, I absolutely do not believe schools should provide free pads and/or tampons to girls because that would only add to the shame, embarrassment, and bullying of these girls. That alone would solve the major problems of period shaming in schools because it would not be an issue of other students shaming these girls anymore. The schools should use their budget for more educational things, and providing free lunches anyways. It would cut back dramatically on the costs for the schools anyways. 
I believe that if students want to buy pads and tampons, they should be able to do so., and that there should be other forms of government assistance for these families that need the help in that area. Other students in school would never know about it either, which gives the bullies less ammo to use against students in poverty. Obviously because the people that need it would be able to buy pads and tampons in a more private way.

In my opinion, I absolutely do not believe schools should provide free pads and/or tampons to girls because that would only add to the shame, embarrassment, and bullying of these girls. That alone would solve the major problems of period shaming in schools because it would not be an issue of other students shaming these girls anymore.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, I absolutely do not believe schools should provide free pads and/or tampons to girls because that would only add to the shame, embarrassment, and bullying of these girls. That alone would solve the major problems of period shaming in schools because it would not be an issue of other students shaming these girls anymore. The schools should use their budget for more educational things, and providing free lunches anyways. It would cut back dramatically on the costs for the schools anyways. 
I believe that if students want to buy pads and tampons, they should be able to do so., and that there should be other forms of government assistance for these families that need the help in that area.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, I absolutely do not believe schools should provide free pads and/or tampons to girls because that would only add to the shame, embarrassment, and bullying of these girls. That alone would solve the major problems of period shaming in schools because it would not be an issue of other students shaming these girls anymore. The schools should use their budget for more educational things, and providing free lunches anyways. It would cut back dramatically on the costs for the schools anyways. 
I believe that if students want to buy pads and tampons, they should be able to do so., and that there should be other forms of government assistance for these families that need the help in that area. Other students in school would never know about it either, which gives the bullies less ammo to use against students in poverty.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, I absolutely do not believe schools should provide free pads and/or tampons to girls because that would only add to the shame, embarrassment, and bullying of these girls. That alone would solve the major problems of period shaming in schools because it would not be an issue of other students shaming these girls anymore. The schools should use their budget for more educational things, and providing free lunches anyways. It would cut back dramatically on the costs for the schools anyways. 
I believe that if students want to buy pads and tampons, they should be able to do so., and that there should be other forms of government assistance for these families that need the help in that area. Other students in school would never know about it either, which gives the bullies less ammo to use against students in poverty.

In my opinion, I absolutely do not believe schools should provide free pads and/or tampons to girls because that would only add to the shame, embarrassment, and bullying of these girls. That alone would solve the major problems of period shaming in schools because it would not be an issue of other students shaming these girls anymore. The schools should use their budget for more educational things, and providing free lunches anyways. It would cut back dramatically on the costs for the schools anyways. 
I believe that if students want to buy pads and tampons, they should be able to do so., and that there should be other forms of government assistance for these families that need the help in that area. Other students in school would never know about it either, which gives the bullies less ammo to use against students in poverty. Obviously because the people that need it would be able to buy pads and tampons in a more private way. 

Schools should also provide a more comprehensive form of ""sex education"" to the students to increase their understanding that periods are only a natural body function of females anyways.
