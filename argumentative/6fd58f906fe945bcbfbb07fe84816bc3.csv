In my opinion, it is not selfish to pursue risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. People have the right to choose what they want to do with their lives. As long as they are not hurting anyone then it's their right to do as they choose. It could be views as selfish but its their body. 

Some people will say that if you have a family that you have to put them first. What if something happened to you? Who will provide for them? Who will take care of them? That brings us to another part of this debate. If you do have a family, is it more selfish if you do an extreme sport purely for fun?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Or is it considered equally selfish as someone who does it as a profession? These are really important factors that drive this debate.

As far as if some sports are just too dangerous to be called a sport, that's something that is an issue all of its own. There are many sports that are dangerous but they are still considered a sport.

In my opinion, it is not selfish to pursue risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. People have the right to choose what they want to do with their lives. As long as they are not hurting anyone then it's their right to do as they choose. It could be views as selfish but its their body. 

Some people will say that if you have a family that you have to put them first. What if something happened to you? Who will provide for them? Who will take care of them? That brings us to another part of this debate. If you do have a family, is it more selfish if you do an extreme sport purely for fun? Or is it considered equally selfish as someone who does it as a profession? These are really important factors that drive this debate. There is no clear answer as its purely a matter of perspective.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is not selfish to pursue risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. People have the right to choose what they want to do with their lives. As long as they are not hurting anyone then it's their right to do as they choose. It could be views as selfish but its their body. 

Some people will say that if you have a family that you have to put them first. What if something happened to you? Who will provide for them? Who will take care of them? That brings us to another part of this debate. If you do have a family, is it more selfish if you do an extreme sport purely for fun? Or is it considered equally selfish as someone who does it as a profession? These are really important factors that drive this debate. There is no clear answer as its purely a matter of perspective. 

As far as if some sports are just too dangerous to be called a sport, that's something that is an issue all of its own. There are many sports that are dangerous but they are still considered a sport. Even a child playing football could end up with a head injury and many parents consider that an acceptable risk. I feel that as long as a sport is popular then public opinion tends to be that the risk is worth it.

In my opinion, it is not selfish to pursue risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. People have the right to choose what they want to do with their lives. As long as they are not hurting anyone then it's their right to do as they choose. It could be views as selfish but its their body. 

Some people will say that if you have a family that you have to put them first. What if something happened to you? Who will provide for them? Who will take care of them? That brings us to another part of this debate. If you do have a family, is it more selfish if you do an extreme sport purely for fun? Or is it considered equally selfish as someone who does it as a profession? These are really important factors that drive this debate. There is no clear answer as its purely a matter of perspective.

Even a child playing football could end up with a head injury and many parents consider that an acceptable risk. I feel that as long as a sport is popular then public opinion tends to be that the risk is worth it. 

It shouldn't be considered selfish to do extreme sports. What we really should focus on is just ensuring that these sports are as safe as possible because people aren't going to stop doing them. That's honestly the best approach to the situation. Then if they are safer maybe we won't judge the people

It shouldn't be considered selfish to do extreme sports. What we really should focus on is just ensuring that these sports are as safe as possible because people aren't going to stop doing them. That's honestly the best approach to the situation. Then if they are safer maybe we won't judge the people participating in them quite as
