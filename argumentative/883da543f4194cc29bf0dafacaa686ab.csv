Personally, if I had to choose between saving an animal or a person from a burning building, then I am choosing the person every time.   I am not saying that I am not an animal lover, because I am.  I think humans should protect animals as much as possible.  However, I believe that human beings are higher on the totem pole of life--for me.  

I believe that people are very empathetic towards the suffering of animals due to the nature of animals.  They are often cute and give unconditional love.  I understand how people become attached to animals.   I just believe that people should be more empathetic towards the suffering of humans.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Personally, if I had to choose between saving an animal or a person from a burning building, then I am choosing the person every time.   I am not saying that I am not an animal lover, because I am.  I think humans should protect animals as much as possible.  However, I believe that human beings are higher on the totem pole of life--for me.  

I believe that people are very empathetic towards the suffering of animals due to the nature of animals.  They are often cute and give unconditional love.  I understand how people become attached to animals.   I just believe that people should be more empathetic towards the suffering of humans.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Personally, if I had to choose between saving an animal or a person from a burning building, then I am choosing the person every time.   I am not saying that I am not an animal lover, because I am.  I think humans should protect animals as much as possible.  However, I believe that human beings are higher on the totem pole of life--for me.  

I believe that people are very empathetic towards the suffering of animals due to the nature of animals.  They are often cute and give unconditional love.  I understand how people become attached to animals.   I just believe that people should be more empathetic towards the suffering of humans.

I believe that people are very empathetic towards the suffering of animals due to the nature of animals.  They are often cute and give unconditional love.  I understand how people become attached to animals.   I just believe that people should be more empathetic towards the suffering of humans.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.  Personally, if I had to choose between saving an animal or a person from a burning building, then I am choosing the person every time.   I am not saying that I am not an animal lover, because I am.  I think humans should protect animals as much as possible.  However, I believe that human beings are higher on the totem pole of life--for me.  

I believe that people are very empathetic towards the suffering of animals due to the nature of animals.  They are often cute and give unconditional love.  I understand how people become attached to animals.   I just believe that people should be more empathetic towards the suffering of humans.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.  Personally, if I had to choose between saving an animal or a person from a burning building, then I am choosing the person every time.   I am not saying that I am not an animal lover, because I am.  I think humans should protect animals as much as possible.  However, I believe that human beings are higher on the totem pole of life--for me.  

I believe that people are very empathetic towards the suffering of animals due to the nature of animals.  They are often cute and give unconditional love.  I understand how people become attached to animals.   I just believe that people should be more empathetic towards the suffering of humans.

Personally, if I had to choose between saving an animal or a person from a burning building, then I am choosing the person every time.   I am not saying that I am not an animal lover, because I am.  I think humans should protect animals as much as possible.  However, I believe that human beings are higher on the totem pole of life--for me.  

I believe that people are very empathetic towards the suffering of animals due to the nature of animals.  They are often cute and give unconditional love.  I understand how people become attached to animals.   I just believe that people should be more empathetic towards the suffering of humans.  

I don't believe we are as empathetic to human suffering as we should be.  There is clearly room for improvement.  Maybe, if human beings improved on empathetic they are, then this world could be a better place.  We could prevent certain problems before they get out of control.  For example, there are mysterious illnes ",1622,[],3,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1098

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Personally, if I had to choose between saving an animal or a person from a burning building, then I am choosing the person every time.   I am not saying that I am not an animal lover, because I am.  I think humans should protect animals as much as possible.  However, I believe that human beings are higher on the totem pole of life--for me.  

I believe that people are very empathetic towards the suffering of animals due to the nature of animals.  They are often cute and give unconditional love.  I understand how people become attached to animals.   I just believe that people should be more empathetic towards the suffering of humans.  

I don't believe we are as empathetic to human suffering as we should be.  There is clearly room for improvement.  Maybe, if human beings improved on empathetic they are, then this world could be a better place.  We could prevent certain problems before they get out of control.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Personally, if I had to choose between saving an animal or a person from a burning building, then I am choosing the person every time.   I am not saying that I am not an animal lover, because I am.  I think humans should protect animals as much as possible.  However, I believe that human beings are higher on the totem pole of life--for me.  

I believe that people are very empathetic towards the suffering of animals due to the nature of animals.  They are often cute and give unconditional love.  I understand how people become attached to animals.   I just believe that people should be more empathetic towards the suffering of humans.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Personally, if I had to choose between saving an animal or a person from a burning building, then I am choosing the person every time.   I am not saying that I am not an animal lover, because I am.  I think humans should protect animals as much as possible.  However, I believe that human beings are higher on the totem pole of life--for me.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.  Personally, if I had to choose between saving an animal or a person from a burning building, then I am choosing the person every time.   I am not saying that I am not an animal lover, because I am.  I think humans should protect animals as much as possible.  However, I believe that human beings are higher on the totem pole of life--for me.  

I believe that people are very empathetic towards the suffering of animals due to the nature of animals.  They are often cute and give unconditional love.  I understand how people become attached to animals.   I just believe that people should be more empathetic towards the suffering of humans.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.  Personally, if I had to choose between saving an animal or a person from a burning building, then I am choosing the person every time.   I am not saying that I am not an animal lover, because I am.  I think humans should protect animals as much as possible.  However, I believe that human beings are higher on the totem pole of life--for me.  

I believe that people are very empathetic towards the suffering of animals due to the nature of animals.  They are often cute and give unconditional love.  I understand how people become attached to animals.   I just believe that people should be more empathetic towards the suffering of humans.  

I don't believe we are as empathetic to human suffering as we should be.  There is clearly room for improvement.  Maybe, if human beings improved on empathetic they are, then this world could be a better place.  We could prevent certain problems before they get out of control.  Far too often, we don't worry about problems until it affects us personally.  If we could show more empathy towards humans, we could limit the number of times situations like this happen.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.  Personally, if I had to choose between saving an animal or a person from a burning building, then I am choosing the person every time.   I am not saying that I am not an animal lover, because I am.  I think humans should protect animals as much as possible.  However, I believe that human beings are higher on the totem pole of life--for me.  

I believe that people are very empathetic towards the suffering of animals due to the nature of animals.  They are often cute and give unconditional love.  I understand how people become attached to animals.   I just believe that people should be more empathetic towards the suffering of humans.  

I don't believe we are as empathetic to human suffering as we should be.  There is clearly room for improvement.  Maybe, if human beings improved on empathetic they are, then this world could be a better place.  We could prevent certain problems before they get out of control.  Far too often, we don't worry about problems until it affects us personally.  If we could show more empathy towards humans, we could limit the number of times situations like this happen.

Personally, if I had to choose between saving an animal or a person from a burning building, then I am choosing the person every time.   I am not saying that I am not an animal lover, because I am.  I think humans should protect animals as much as possible.  However, I believe that human beings are higher on the totem pole of life--for me.  

I believe that people are very empathetic towards the suffering of animals due to the nature of animals.  They are often cute and give unconditional love.  I understand how people become attached to animals.   I just believe that people should be more empathetic towards the suffering of humans.  

I don't believe we are as empathetic to human suffering as we should be.  There is clearly room for improvement.  Maybe, if human beings improved on empathetic they are, then this world could be a better place.  We could prevent certain problems before they get out of control.  Far too often, we don't worry about problems until it affects us personally.  If we could show more empathy towards humans, we could limit the number of times situations like this happen.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.  Personally, if I had to choose between saving an animal or a person from a burning building, then I am choosing the person every time.   I am not saying that I am not an animal lover, because I am.  I think humans should protect animals as much as possible.  However, I believe that human beings are higher on the totem pole of life--for me.  

I believe that people are very empathetic towards the suffering of animals due to the nature of animals.  They are often cute and give unconditional love.  I understand how people become attached to animals.   I just believe that people should be more empathetic towards the suffering of humans.  

I don't believe we are as empathetic to human suffering as we should be.  There is clearly room for improvement.  Maybe, if human beings improved on empathetic they are, then this world could be a better place.  We could prevent certain problems before they get out of control.  Far too often, we don't worry about problems until it affects us personally.  If we could show more empathy towards humans, we could limit the number of times situations like this happen.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.  Personally, if I had to choose between saving an animal or a person from a burning building, then I am choosing the person every time.   I am not saying that I am not an animal lover, because I am.  I think humans should protect animals as much as possible.  However, I believe that human beings are higher on the totem pole of life--for me.  

I believe that people are very empathetic towards the suffering of animals due to the nature of animals.  They are often cute and give unconditional love.  I understand how people become attached to animals.   I just believe that people should be more empathetic towards the suffering of humans.  

I don't believe we are as empathetic to human suffering as we should be.  There is clearly room for improvement.  Maybe, if human beings improved on empathetic they are, then this world could be a better place.  We could prevent certain problems before they get out of control.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.  Personally, if I had to choose between saving an animal or a person from a burning building, then I am choosing the person every time.   I am not saying that I am not an animal lover, because I am.  I think humans should protect animals as much as possible.  However, I believe that human beings are higher on the totem pole of life--for me.  

I believe that people are very empathetic towards the suffering of animals due to the nature of animals.  They are often cute and give unconditional love.  I understand how people become attached to animals.   I just believe that people should be more empathetic towards the suffering of humans.  

I don't believe we are as empathetic to human suffering as we should be.  There is clearly room for improvement.  Maybe, if human beings improved on empathetic they are, then this world could be a better place.  We could prevent certain problems before they get out of control.  Far too often, we don't worry about problems until it affects us personally.  If we could show more empathy towards humans, we could limit the number of times situations like this happen.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.  Personally, if I had to choose between saving an animal or a person from a burning building, then I am choosing the person every time.   I am not saying that I am not an animal lover, because I am.  I think humans should protect animals as much as possible.  However, I believe that human beings are higher on the totem pole of life--for me.  

I believe that people are very empathetic towards the suffering of animals due to the nature of animals.  They are often cute and give unconditional love.  I understand how people become attached to animals.   I just believe that people should be more empathetic towards the suffering of humans.  

I don't believe we are as empathetic to human suffering as we should be.  There is clearly room for improvement.  Maybe, if human beings improved on empathetic they are, then this world could be a better place.  We could prevent certain problems before they get out of control.  Far too often, we don't worry about problems until it affects us personally.  If we could show more empathy towards humans, we could limit the number of times situations like this happen.

Personally, if I had to choose between saving an animal or a person from a burning building, then I am choosing the person every time.   I am not saying that I am not an animal lover, because I am.  I think humans should protect animals as much as possible.  However, I believe that human beings are higher on the totem pole of life--for me.  

I believe that people are very empathetic towards the suffering of animals due to the nature of animals.  They are often cute and give unconditional love.  I understand how people become attached to animals.   I just believe that people should be more empathetic towards the suffering of humans.  

I don't believe we are as empathetic to human suffering as we should be.  There is clearly room for improvement.  Maybe, if human beings improved on empathetic they are, then this world could be a better place.  We could prevent certain problems before they get out of control.  Far too often, we don't worry about problems until it affects us personally.  If we could show more empathy towards humans, we could limit the number of times situations like this happen.

Personally, if I had to choose between saving an animal or a person from a burning building, then I am choosing the person every time.   I am not saying that I am not an animal lover, because I am.  I think humans should protect animals as much as possible.  However, I believe that human beings are higher on the totem pole of life--for me.  

I believe that people are very empathetic towards the suffering of animals due to the nature of animals.  They are often cute and give unconditional love.  I understand how people become attached to animals.   I just believe that people should be more empathetic towards the suffering of humans.  

I don't believe we are as empathetic to human suffering as we should be.  There is clearly room for improvement.  Maybe, if human beings improved on empathetic they are, then this world could be a better place.  We could prevent certain problems before they get out of control.  Far too often, we don't worry about problems until it affects us personally.  If we could show more empathy towards humans, we could limit the number of times situations like this happen.

I don't believe we are as empathetic to human suffering as we should be.  There is clearly room for improvement.  Maybe, if human beings improved on empathetic they are, then this world could be a better place.  We could prevent certain problems before they get out of control.

I think humans should protect animals as much as possible.  However, I believe that human beings are higher on the totem pole of life--for me.  

I believe that people are very empathetic towards the suffering of animals due to the nature of animals.  They are often cute and give unconditional love.  I understand how people become attached to animals.   I just believe that people should be more empathetic towards the suffering of humans.  

I don't believe we are as empathetic to human suffering as we should be.  There is clearly room for improvement.  Maybe, if human beings improved on empathetic they are, then this world could be a better place.  We could prevent certain problems before they get out of control.  Far too often, we don't worry about problems until it affects us personally.  If we could show more empathy towards humans, we could limit the number of times situations like this happen.
