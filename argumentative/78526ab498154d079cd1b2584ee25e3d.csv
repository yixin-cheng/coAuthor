Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology can affect dating in multiple ways. It can either affect dating in a positive way or in a negative way depending on your personality. 
In my case, I've found that technology has affected dating in a positive way.
 I have found that being able to communicate with your significant other over the internet or with apps, makes it easier to handle conflicts and things that may upset your partner because you are not face-to-face with them so that eases a lot of the stress and anxiety of the conflicts. 

ecause of technology, I've also found that it's easier to keep your significant other up to date with what you are doing.
 For instance, I've found that I am able to send my girlfriend little funny text messages about my day which she appreciates, and then she sends me come back and you can send them whenever you want provided your not working or are on a work break. 

On the other hand, technology could affect some people in a negative way maybe if they are a more outgoing person and would rather be talking face to face with someone rather than talking with someone over text. They might feel more lonely if they don't have someone

In my opinion, technology can affect dating in multiple ways. It can either affect dating in a positive way or in a negative way depending on your personality. 
In my case, I've found that technology has affected dating in a positive way.
 I have found that being able to communicate with your significant other over the internet or with apps, makes it easier to handle conflicts and things that may upset your partner because you are not face-to-face with them so that eases a lot of the stress and anxiety of the conflicts. 

ecause of technology, I've also found that it's easier to keep your significant other up to date with what you are doing.
 For instance, I've found that I am able to send my girlfriend little funny text messages about my day which she appreciates, and you can send them whenever you want provided your not working or are on a work break. 

On the other hand, technology could affect some people in a negative way maybe if they are a more outgoing person and would rather be talking face to face with someone rather than talking with someone over text. They might feel more lonely than more introverted people.

So to conclude, in my opinion, technology affects dating in a positive way for more introverted people. And it would probably affect more outgoing people in a negative way since they would prefer to be face to face rather than text. dkdjd",1742,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1173

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology can affect dating in multiple ways. It can either affect dating in a positive way or in a negative way depending on your personality. 
In my case, I've found that technology has affected dating in a positive way.
 I have found that being able to communicate with your significant other over the internet or with apps, makes it easier to handle conflicts and things that may upset your partner because you are not face-to-face with them so that eases a lot of the stress and anxiety of the conflicts. 

ecause of technology, I've also found that it's easier to keep your significant other up to date with what you are doing.

In my opinion, technology can affect dating in multiple ways. It can either affect dating in a positive way or in a negative way depending on your personality. 
In my case, I've found that technology has affected dating in a positive way.
 I have found that being able to communicate with your significant other over the internet or with apps, makes it easier to handle conflicts and things that may upset your partner because you are not face-to-face with them so that eases a lot of the stress and anxiety of the conflicts. 

ecause of technology, I've also found that it's easier to keep your significant other up to date with what you are doing.
 For instance, I've found that I am able to send my girlfriend little funny text messages about my day which she appreciates, and you can send them whenever you want provided your not working or are on a work break. 

On the other hand, technology could affect some people in a negative way maybe if they are a more outgoing person and would rather be talking face to face with someone rather than talking with someone over text. They might feel more lonely than more introverted people.

In my opinion, technology can affect dating in multiple ways. It can either affect dating in a positive way or in a negative way depending on your personality. 
In my case, I've found that technology has affected dating in a positive way.
 I have found that being able to communicate with your significant other over the internet or with apps, makes it easier to handle conflicts and things that may upset your partner because you are not face-to-face with them so that eases a lot of the stress and anxiety of the conflicts. 

ecause of technology, I've also found that it's easier to keep your significant other up to date with what you are doing.
 For instance, I've found that I am able to send my girlfriend little funny text messages about my day which she appreciates, and you can send them whenever you want provided your not working or are on a work break. 

On the other hand, technology could affect some people in a negative way maybe if they are a more outgoing person and would rather be talking face to face with someone rather than talking with someone over text. They might feel more lonely than more introverted people.

So to conclude, in my opinion, technology affects dating in a positive way for more introverted people. And it would probably affect more outgoing people in a negative way since they would prefer to be face to face rather than text. I feel like this is common s",1765,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1294

 I have found that being able to communicate with your significant other over the internet or with apps, makes it easier to handle conflicts and things that may upset your partner because you are not face-to-face with them so that eases a lot of the stress and anxiety of the conflicts.
