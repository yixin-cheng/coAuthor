This will allow for them to grow socially so they have a chance of being successful in whatever profession they are interested in pursuing. If they are not able to get along with others, then that same ability will be lacking when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents that think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. ",1232,[],2,2,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,483

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to interact and get along with their peers.

If they are not able to get along with others, then that same ability will be lacking when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents that think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others. So, I do not think homeschooling is okay because it destroys your so-called social life.

If they are not able to get along with others, then that same ability will be lacking when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents that think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others. So, I do not think homeschooling is okay because it destroys your so-called social life.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to interact and get along with their peers. This will allow for them to grow socially so they have a chance of being successful in whatever profession they are interested in pursuing. If they are not able to get along with others, then that same ability will be lacking when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents that think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others. So, I do not think homeschooling is okay because it destroys your so-called social life.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to interact and get along with their peers. This will allow for them to grow socially so they have a chance of being successful in whatever profession they are interested in pursuing. If they are not able to get along with others, then that same ability will be lacking when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents that think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others. So, I do not think homeschooling is okay because it destroys your so-called social life.

This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents that think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others. So, I do not think homeschooling is okay because it destroys your so-called social life.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to interact and get along with their peers. This will allow for them to grow socially so they have a chance of being successful in whatever profession they are interested in pursuing. If they are not able to get along with others, then that same ability will be lacking when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents that think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to interact and get along with their peers. This will allow for them to grow socially so they have a chance of being successful in whatever profession they are interested in pursuing. If they are not able to get along with others, then that same ability will be lacking when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents that think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others. So, I do not think homeschooling is okay because it destroys your so-called social life.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to interact and get along with their peers. This will allow for them to grow socially so they have a chance of being successful in whatever profession they are interested in pursuing. If they are not able to get along with others, then that same ability will be lacking when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents that think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others. So, I do not think homeschooling is okay because it destroys your so-called social life.

If they are not able to get along with others, then that same ability will be lacking when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents that think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others. So, I do not think homeschooling is okay because it destroys your so-called social life.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to interact and get along with their peers. This will allow for them to grow socially so they have a chance of being successful in whatever profession they are interested in pursuing. If they are not able to get along with others, then that same ability will be lacking when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents that think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others. So, I do not think homeschooling is okay because it destroys your so-called social life.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to interact and get along with their peers. This will allow for them to grow socially so they have a chance of being successful in whatever profession they are interested in pursuing. If they are not able to get along with others, then that same ability will be lacking when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents that think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to interact and get along with their peers. This will allow for them to grow socially so they have a chance of being successful in whatever profession they are interested in pursuing. If they are not able to get along with others, then that same ability will be lacking when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents that think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others. So, I do not think homeschooling is okay because it destroys your so-called social life.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to interact and get along with their peers. This will allow for them to grow socially so they have a chance of being successful in whatever profession they are interested in pursuing. If they are not able to get along with others, then that same ability will be lacking when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents that think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others. So, I do not think homeschooling is okay because it destroys your so-called social life.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to interact and get along with their peers. This will allow for them to grow socially so they have a chance of being successful in whatever profession they are interested in pursuing. If they are not able to get along with others, then that same ability will be lacking when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents that think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others. So, I do not think homeschooling is okay because it destroys your so-called social life.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to interact and get along with their peers. This will allow for them to grow socially so they have a chance of being successful in whatever profession they are interested in pursuing. If they are not able to get along with others, then that same ability will be lacking when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents that think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to interact and get along with their peers. This will allow for them to grow socially so they have a chance of being successful in whatever profession they are interested in pursuing. If they are not able to get along with others, then that same ability will be lacking when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to interact and get along with their peers. This will allow for them to grow socially so they have a chance of being successful in whatever profession they are interested in pursuing. If they are not able to get along with others, then that same ability will be lacking when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents that think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others. So, I do not think homeschooling is okay because it destroys your so-called social life.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to interact and get along with their peers. This will allow for them to grow socially so they have a chance of being successful in whatever profession they are interested in pursuing. If they are not able to get along with others, then that same ability will be lacking when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents that think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others. So, I do not think homeschooling is okay because it destroys your so-called social life. 

At school, teachers act like your guardians and the classmates act like someone that you interact with everyday. Students learn to obey authority and the rules set by the school. They interact with their peers while following the school rules, just like adults following the rules set by their workplace. The school will allow your child to experience what it’s like to follow rules everyday like how it should be done in the real world. This wil",1832,[],3,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,922

If they are not able to get along with others, then that same ability will be lacking when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents that think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others. So, I do not think homeschooling is okay because it destroys your so-called social life. 

At school, teachers act like your guardians and the classmates act like someone that you interact with everyday. Students learn to obey authority and the rules set by the school.

If they are not able to get along with others, then that same ability will be lacking when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents that think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others. So, I do not think homeschooling is okay because it destroys your so-called social life. 

At school, teachers act like your guardians and the classmates act like someone that you interact with everyday. Students learn to obey authority and the rules set by the school.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to interact and get along with their peers. This will allow for them to grow socially so they have a chance of being successful in whatever profession they are interested in pursuing. If they are not able to get along with others, then that same ability will be lacking when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents that think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others. So, I do not think homeschooling is okay because it destroys your so-called social life. 

At school, teachers act like your guardians and the classmates act like someone that you interact with everyday. Students learn to obey authority and the rules set by the school. They interact with their peers while following the school rules, just like adults following the rules set by their workplace. The school will allow your child to experience what it’s like to follow rules everyday like how it should be done in the real world. This will make them better prepared for their future life.",638,[],3,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,973

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to interact and get along with their peers. This will allow for them to grow socially so they have a chance of being successful in whatever profession they are interested in pursuing. If they are not able to get along with others, then they will lack  same ability will be lacking when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents that think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others. So, I do not think homeschooling is okay because it destroys your so-called social life. 

At school, teachers act like your guardians and the classmates act like someone that you interact with everyday. Students learn to obey authority and the rules set by the school. They interact with their peers while following the school rules, just like adults following the rules set by their workplace. The school will allow your child to experience what it’s like to follow rules everyday like how it should be done in the real world.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to interact and get along with their peers. This will allow for them to grow socially so they have a chance of being successful in whatever profession they are interested in pursuing. If they are not able to get along with others, then they will lack the same ability when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession they are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents who think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others.

I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents who think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others. So, I do not think homeschooling is effective because it destroys your so-called social life. 

At school, teachers act like your guardians and the classmates act like someone that you interact with everyday. Students learn to obey authority and the rules set by the school. They interact with their peers while following the school rules, just like adults following the rules set by their workplace. The school will allow your child to experience what it’s like to follow rules everyday, like how it should be done in the real world. This will make them better prepared for their future life.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to interact and get along with their peers. This will allow for them to grow socially so they have a chance of being successful in whatever profession they are interested in pursuing. If they are not able to get along with others, then they will lack the same ability when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession they are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents who think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others. So, I do not think homeschooling is effective because it destroys your so-called social life. 

At school, teachers act like your guardians and the classmates act like someone that you interact with everyday. Students learn to obey authority and the rules set by the school. They interact with their peers while following the school rules, just like adults following the rules set by their workplace. The school will allow your child to experience what it’s like to follow rules everyday, like how it should be done in the real world. This will make them better prepared for their future life.
