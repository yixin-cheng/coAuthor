 The pace is your own. The descriptions, the tone, the characters' voices, all are part of your creation. Your emotions and actions are very much your own.   You are both a reader and a participant in the story. You decide how much, if at all, you interact with the characters and both their conversations and actions.

When you are listening to an audiobook, your level of interaction is very different.   Instead of creating the images for yourself, you are using the reader's voice and intonations to create a mental picture. The mood, tone, inflections, and interpretation have already been done for you by the voice artist. You are a listener, rather than a player. The voice artist is the one creating a mental picture for you, taking away the ability to create your own. 
There are some levels in which this can be good.

In my opinion, the primary difference between listening and reading is the level of interaction one has with the book. 
When you read, you are the one creating the images in your head.
 The pace is your own. The descriptions, the tone, the characters' voices, all are part of your creation. Your emotions and actions are very much your own.   You are both a reader and a participant in the story. You decide how much, if at all, you interact with the characters and both their conversations and actions.

When you are listening to an audiobook, your level of interaction is very different.   Instead of creating the images for yourself, you are using the reader's voice and intonations to create a mental picture. The mood, tone, inflections, and interpretation have already been done for you by the voice artist. You are a listener, rather than a player. The voice artist is the one creating a mental picture for you, taking away the ability to create your own.

In my opinion, the primary difference between listening and reading is the level of interaction one has with the book. 
When you read, you are the one creating the images in your head.
 The pace is your own. The descriptions, the tone, the characters' voices, all are part of your creation. Your emotions and actions are very much your own.   You are both a reader and a participant in the story. You decide how much, if at all, you interact with the characters and both their conversations and actions.

When you are listening to an audiobook, your level of interaction is very different.   Instead of creating the images for yourself, you are using the reader's voice and intonations to create a mental picture. The mood, tone, inflections, and interpretation have already been done for you by the voice artist. You are a listener, rather than a player. The voice artist is the one creating a mental picture for you, taking away the ability to create your own.

In my opinion, the primary difference between listening and reading is the level of interaction one has with the book. 
When you read, you are the one creating the images in your head.
 The pace is your own. The descriptions, the tone, the characters' voices, all are part of your creation. Your emotions and actions are very much your own.   You are both a reader and a participant in the story. You decide how much, if at all, you interact with the characters and both their conversations and actions.

When you are listening to an audiobook, your level of interaction is very different.   Instead of creating the images for yourself, you are using the reader's voice and intonations to create a mental picture. The mood, tone, inflections, and interpretation have already been done for you by the voice artist. You are a listener, rather than a player. The voice artist is the one creating a mental picture for you, taking away the ability to create your own. 
There are some levels in which this can be good.
 For instance, you may not be able to read because you are visually impaired and cannot see the words. Or if you struggle with a short attention span or problems focusing, listening may work better for you. Or perhaps you simply don't like reading, or it is just more convenient to listen.  n",1566,[],0,4,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,478

In my opinion, the primary difference between listening and reading is the level of interaction one has with the book. 
When you read, you are the one creating the images in your head.
 The pace is your own. The descriptions, the tone, the characters' voices, all are part of your creation. Your emotions and actions are very much your own.   You are both a reader and a participant in the story. You decide how much, if at all, you interact with the characters and both their conversations and actions.

When you are listening to an audiobook, your level of interaction is very different.   Instead of creating the images for yourself, you are using the reader's voice and intonations to create a mental picture. The mood, tone, inflections, and interpretation have already been done for you by the voice artist. You are a listener, rather than a player. The voice artist is the one creating a mental picture for you, taking away the ability to create your own. 
There are some levels in which this can be good.
 For instance, you may not be able to read because you are visually impaired and cannot see the words. Or if you struggle with a short attention span or problems focusing, listening may work better for you. Or perhaps you simply don't like reading, or it is just more convenient to listen.

In my opinion, the primary difference between listening and reading is the level of interaction one has with the book. 
When you read, you are the one creating the images in your head.
 The pace is your own. The descriptions, the tone, the characters' voices, all are part of your creation. Your emotions and actions are very much your own.   You are both a reader and a participant in the story. You decide how much, if at all, you interact with the characters and both their conversations and actions.

When you are listening to an audiobook, your level of interaction is very different.   Instead of creating the images for yourself, you are using the reader's voice and intonations to create a mental picture. The mood, tone, inflections, and interpretation have already been done for you by the voice artist. You are a listener, rather than a player. The voice artist is the one creating a mental picture for you, taking away the ability to create your own. 
There are some levels in which this can be good.

When you read, you are the one creating the images in your head.
 The pace is your own. The descriptions, the tone, the characters' voices, all are part of your creation. Your emotions and actions are very much your own.   You are both a reader and a participant in the story. You decide how much, if at all, you interact with the characters and both their conversations and actions.

When you are listening to an audiobook, your level of interaction is very different.   Instead of creating the images for yourself, you are using the reader's voice and intonations to create a mental picture. The mood, tone, inflections, and interpretation have already been done for you by the voice artist. You are a listener, rather than a player. The voice artist is the one creating a mental picture for you, taking away the ability to create your own. 
There are some levels in which this can be good.
 For instance, you may not be able to read because you are visually impaired and cannot see the words. Or if you struggle with a short attention span or problems focusing, listening may work better for you. Or perhaps you simply don't like reading, or it is just more convenient to listen.  One downside of listening is that you cannot speed up or slow down the voice artist's reading. It is even possible that you might dislike the voice of ",1716,[],2,2,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,584

In my opinion, the primary difference between listening and reading is the level of interaction one has with the book. 
When you read, you are the one creating the images in your head.
 The pace is your own. The descriptions, the tone, the characters' voices, all are part of your creation. Your emotions and actions are very much your own.   You are both a reader and a participant in the story. You decide how much, if at all, you interact with the characters and both their conversations and actions.

When you are listening to an audiobook, your level of interaction is very different.   Instead of creating the images for yourself, you are using the reader's voice and intonations to create a mental picture. The mood, tone, inflections, and interpretation have already been done for you by the voice artist. You are a listener, rather than a player. The voice artist is the one creating a mental picture for you, taking away the ability to create your own. 
There are some levels in which this can be good.

 The pace is your own. The descriptions, the tone, the characters' voices, all are part of your creation. Your emotions and actions are very much your own.   You are both a reader and a participant in the story. You decide how much, if at all, you interact with the characters and both their conversations and actions.

When you are listening to an audiobook, your level of interaction is very different.   Instead of creating the images for yourself, you are using the reader's voice and intonations to create a mental picture. The mood, tone, inflections, and interpretation have already been done for you by the voice artist. You are a listener, rather than a player. The voice artist is the one creating a mental picture for you, taking away the ability to create your own. 
There are some levels in which this can be good.
 For instance, you may not be able to read because you are visually impaired and cannot see the words. Or if you struggle with a short attention span or problems focusing, listening may work better for you. Or perhaps you simply don't like reading, or it is just more convenient to listen.  One downside of listening is that you cannot speed up or slow down the voice artist's reading. It is even possible that you might dislike the voice of the narrator, which makes it impossible to listen to. 

Either way,   listening to a book can give you a similar experience of reading, and it is great for encouraging children to read.
