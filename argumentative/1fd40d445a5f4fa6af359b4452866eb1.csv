In my opinion, listening to an audiobook is just as good as reading it if not better. I have listened to many audiobooks and I have read many books, I think audiobooks free up you body to do tasks that require very little conscious thought while taking in all the information being read to you. or example, I have listened to audiobooks while doing chores around the house, driving, and working out.
 I can t read a book and do those things. I am able to consume many more books this way. I used to have a huge backlog of books that I wanted to read but never had the time and it just kept growing until audiobooks and sites that offered then started to grow exponentially. I managed to finally get through them all and now I actively seek new ones all the time. I constantly have one on when I'm in the car or before bed. As an added bonus they are great for helping me get to sleep.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, listening to an audiobook is just as good as reading it if not better. I have listened to many audiobooks and I have read many books, I think audiobooks free up you body to do tasks that require very little conscious thought while taking in all the information being read to you. or example, I have listened to audiobooks while doing chores around the house, driving, and working out.
 I can t read a book and do those things. I am able to consume many more books this way. I used to have a huge backlog of books that I wanted to read but never had the time and it just kept growing until audiobooks and sites that offered then started to grow exponentially. I managed to finally get through them all and now I actively seek new ones all the time. I constantly have one on when I'm in the car or before bed. As an added bonus they are great for helping me get to sleep. I honestly cant think of one disadvantage to audiobooks over regular books other then how relaxing it can be to sit outside and read on a nice day. Then again, I could just listen to the book and enjoy the scenery.

In my opinion, listening to an audiobook is just as good as reading it if not better. I have listened to many audiobooks and I have read many books, I think audiobooks free up you body to do tasks that require very little conscious thought while taking in all the information being read to you. or example, I have listened to audiobooks while doing chores around the house, driving, and working out.
 I can t read a book and do those things. I am able to consume many more books this way. I used to have a huge backlog of books that I wanted to read but never had the time and it just kept growing until audiobooks and sites that offered then started to grow exponentially. I managed to finally get through them all and now I actively seek new ones all the time. I constantly have one on when I'm in the car or before bed. As an added bonus they are great for helping me get to sleep. I honestly cant think of one disadvantage to audiobooks over regular books other then how relaxing it can be to sit outside and read on a nice day. Then again, I could just listen to the book and enjoy the scenery.

In my opinion, listening to an audiobook is just as good as reading it if not better. I have listened to many audiobooks and I have read many books, I think audiobooks free up you body to do tasks that require very little conscious thought while taking in all the information being read to you. or example, I have listened to audiobooks while doing chores around the house, driving, and working out.
 I can t read a book and do those things. I am able to consume many more books this way. I used to have a huge backlog of books that I wanted to read but never had the time and it just kept growing until audiobooks and sites that offered then started to grow exponentially. I managed to finally get through them all and now I actively seek new ones all the time. I constantly have one on when I'm in the car or before bed. As an added bonus they are great for helping me get to sleep. I honestly cant think of one disadvantage to audiobooks over regular books other then how relaxing it can be to sit outside and read on a nice day.

I managed to finally get through them all and now I actively seek new ones all the time. I constantly have one on when I'm in the car or before bed. As an added bonus they are great for helping me get to sleep. I honestly cant think of one disadvantage to audiobooks over regular books other then how relaxing it can be to sit outside and read on a nice day. Then again, I could just listen to the book and enjoy the scenery. 
In my opinion, without any doubt is that audiobooks are superior to regular books on almost every level.",1440,[],0,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1286
