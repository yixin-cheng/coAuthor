In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point.

When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox.

So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing.

When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox.

She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point.

And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about?  ",2391,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1093

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her.

Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her. But that didn't stop her from sending me a series of crazy texts and posting selfies of herself on Facebook, with tags to my account, over the next few weeks.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her.

When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her. But that didn't stop her from sending me a series of crazy texts and posting selfies of herself on Facebook, with tags to my account, over the next few weeks.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her. But that didn't stop her from sending me a series of crazy texts and posting selfies of herself on Facebook, with tags to my account, over the next few weeks.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her. But that didn't stop her from sending me a series of crazy texts and posting selfies of herself on Facebook, with tags to my account, over the next few weeks.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point.

When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her. But that didn't stop her from sending me a series of crazy texts and posting selfies of herself on Facebook, with tags to my account, over the next few weeks.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her. But that didn't stop her from sending me a series of crazy texts and posting selfies of herself on Facebook, with tags to my account, over the next few weeks.

When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her. But that didn't stop her from sending me a series of crazy texts and posting selfies of herself on Facebook, with tags to my account, over the next few weeks. I mean, technology just blew up any chance she had with me, because all of her efforts just came off as purely crazy to me. So yes, while she's t",2908,[],0,4,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1388

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack.

Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her. But that didn't stop her from sending me a series of crazy texts and posting selfies of herself on Facebook, with tags to my account, over the next few weeks. I mean, technology just blew up any chance she had with me, because all of her efforts just came off as purely crazy to me. So yes, while she's terrific at making herself look all glamorous on her Tinder profile, she's a nutjob who has no one to blame but herself for giving me a negative impression of her.

Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her. But that didn't stop her from sending me a series of crazy texts and posting selfies of herself on Facebook, with tags to my account, over the next few weeks. I mean, technology just blew up any chance she had with me, because all of her efforts just came off as purely crazy to me. So yes, while she's terrific at making herself look all glamorous on her Tinder profile, she's a nutjob who has no one to blame but herself for giving me a negative impression of her.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her. But that didn't stop her from sending me a series of crazy texts and posting selfies of herself on Facebook, with tags to my account, over the next few weeks. I mean, technology just blew up any chance she had with me, because all of her efforts just came off as purely crazy to me.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her. But that didn't stop her from sending me a series of crazy texts and posting selfies of herself on Facebook, with tags to my account, over the next few weeks. I mean, technology just blew up any chance she had with me, because all of her efforts just came off as purely crazy to me. So yes, while she's terrific at making herself look all glamorous on her Tinder profile, she's a nutjob who has no one to blame but herself for giving me a negative impression of her. That's why I say that technology ",3104,[],1,1,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1467

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox.

 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her. But that didn't stop her from sending me a series of crazy texts and posting selfies of herself on Facebook, with tags to my account, over the next few weeks. I mean, technology just blew up any chance she had with me, because all of her efforts just came off as purely crazy to me. So yes, while she's terrific at making herself look all glamorous on her Tinder profile, she's a nutjob who has no one to blame but herself for giving me a negative impression of her.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her. But that didn't stop her from sending me a series of crazy texts and posting selfies of herself on Facebook, with tags to my account, over the next few weeks. I mean, technology just blew up any chance she had with me, because all of her efforts just came off as purely crazy to me. So yes, while she's terrific at making herself look all glamorous on her Tinder profile, she's a nutjob who has no one to blame but herself for giving me a negative impression of her. That's why I say that technology has made dating worse. It really allows the worst in a g",3160,[],1,1,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1525

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her. But that didn't stop her from sending me a series of crazy texts and posting selfies of herself on Facebook, with tags to my account, over the next few weeks. I mean, technology just blew up any chance she had with me, because all of her efforts just came off as purely crazy to me. So yes, while she's terrific at making herself look all glamorous on her Tinder profile, she's a nutjob who has no one to blame but herself for giving me a negative impression of her. That's why I say that technology has made dating worse. It really allows the worst in a girl to come out som",3179,[],1,1,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1544

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her. But that didn't stop her from sending me a series of crazy texts and posting selfies of herself on Facebook, with tags to my account, over the next few weeks. I mean, technology just blew up any chance she had with me, because all of her efforts just came off as purely crazy to me. So yes, while she's terrific at making herself look all glamorous on her Tinder profile, she's a nutjob who has no one to blame but herself for giving me a negative impression of her. That's why I say that technology has made dating worse. It really allows the worst in a girl to come out sometimes. And I say",3196,[],1,1,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1563

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her. But that didn't stop her from sending me a series of crazy texts and posting selfies of herself on Facebook, with tags to my account, over the next few weeks. I mean, technology just blew up any chance she had with me, because all of her efforts just came off as purely crazy to me. So yes, while she's terrific at making herself look all glamorous on her Tinder profile, she's a nutjob who has no one to blame but herself for giving me a negative impression of her. That's why I say that technology has made dating worse. It really allows the worst in a girl to come out sometimes. And I say this from personal",3215,[],1,1,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1582

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her. But that didn't stop her from sending me a series of crazy texts and posting selfies of herself on Facebook, with tags to my account, over the next few weeks.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her. But that didn't stop her from sending me a series of crazy texts and posting selfies of herself on Facebook, with tags to my account, over the next few weeks. I mean, technology just blew up any chance she had with me, because all of her efforts just came off as purely crazy to me. So yes, while she's terrific at making herself look all glamorous on her Tinder profile, she's a nutjob who has no one to blame but herself for giving me a negative impression of her. That's why I say that technology has made dating worse. It really allows the worst in a girl to come out sometimes. And I say this from personal experience, because ",3236,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1610

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar on the Upp. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar on the Upper West S. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her. But that didn't stop her from sending me a series of crazy texts and posting selfies of herself on Facebook, with tags to my account, over the next few weeks. I mean, technology just blew up any chance she had with me, because all of her efforts just came off as purely crazy to me. So yes, while she's terrific at making herself look all glamorous on her Tinder profile, she's a nutjob who has no one to blame but herself for giving me a negative impression of her. That's why I say that technology has made dating worse. It really allows the worst in a girl to come out sometimes.

When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her. But that didn't stop her from sending me a series of crazy texts and posting selfies of herself on Facebook, with tags to my account, over the next few weeks. I mean, technology just blew up any chance she had with me, because all of her efforts just came off as purely crazy to me. So yes, while she's terrific at making herself look all glamorous on her Tinder profile, she's a nutjob who has no one to blame but herself for giving me a negative impression of her. That's why I say that technology has made dating worse. It really allows the worst in a girl to come out sometimes.

She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her. But that didn't stop her from sending me a series of crazy texts and posting selfies of herself on Facebook, with tags to my account, over the next few weeks. I mean, technology just blew up any chance she had with me, because all of her efforts just came off as purely crazy to me. So yes, while she's terrific at making herself look all glamorous on her Tinder profile, she's a nutjob who has no one to blame but herself for giving me a negative impression of her.

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar on the Upper West Side, in her neighborho. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar on the Upper West Side, in her neighborhood in New. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar on the Upper West Side, in her neighborhood in New York. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her. But that didn't stop her from sending me a series of crazy texts and posting selfies of herself on Facebook, with tags to my account, over the next few weeks. I mean, technology just blew up any chance she had with me, because all of her efforts just came off as purely crazy to me. So yes, while she's terrific at making herself look all glamorous on her Tinder profile, she's a nutjob who has no one to blame but herself for giving me a negative impression of her. That's why I say that technology has made dating worse. It really allows the worst in a girl to come out sometimes.
