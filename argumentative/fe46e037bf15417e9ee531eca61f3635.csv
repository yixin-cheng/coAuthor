In my opinion, most definitely, listening to an audiobook is just as good as reading the paper variant of the same book. Let's break it down, shall we? At least for me personally, I do not derive as much pleasure from reading books as I used to. Call me lazy, whatever. I like to listen to the audiobook version of almost anything because the narrator more often than not adds personality to the characters my mind does not. Such as voices, an example of that would be the Harry Potter Audiobooks and The Hobbit audiobooks.

There is nothing better, as far as being able to read a book, than to be able to do what is needed throughout the day and still be able to listen to a book. I can do chores, run errands, and even go to work and still be able to listen to a book, an not miss out on a new or even classic I really enjoy.

I don't know about you, but I find it far more convenient to buy a book online via Amazon or Audible, than to try to find an almost non existent Barnes and Noble or Books-a-Million in my area. I can just click and buy, so why not just get the audio version of whatever book.

In my opinion, most definitely, listening to an audiobook is just as good as reading the paper variant of the same book. Let's break it down, shall we? At least for me personally, I do not derive as much pleasure from reading books as I used to. Call me lazy, whatever. I like to listen to the audiobook version of almost anything because the narrator more often than not adds personality to the characters my mind does not. Such as voices, an example of that would be the Harry Potter Audiobooks and The Hobbit audiobooks.

Do we even have enough time in the day anymore to do what we like, or even need to do. I personally do not. There is nothing better, as far as being able to read a book, than to be able to do what is needed throughout the day and still be able to listen to a book. I can do chores, run errands, and even go to work and still be able to listen to a book, an not miss out on a new or even classic I really enjoy.

I don't know about you, but I find it far more convenient to buy a book online via Amazon or Audible, than to try to find an almost non existent Barnes and Noble or Books-a-Million in my area. I can just click and buy, so why not just get the audio version of whatever book. 
I think that audiobooks are a great way to get through a book, especially if you are not able to sit down and read it

In my opinion, most definitely, listening to an audiobook is just as good as reading the paper variant of the same book. Let's break it down, shall we? At least for me personally, I do not derive as much pleasure from reading books as I used to. Call me lazy, whatever.

There is nothing better, as far as being able to read a book, than to be able to do what is needed throughout the day and still be able to listen to a book. I can do chores, run errands, and even go to work and still be able to listen to a book, an not miss out on a new or even classic I really enjoy.

I don't know about you, but I find it far more convenient to buy a book online via Amazon or Audible, than to try to find an almost non existent Barnes and Noble or Books-a-Million in my area. I can just click and buy, so why not just get the audio version of whatever book.

In my opinion, most definitely, listening to an audiobook is just as good as reading the paper variant of the same book. Let's break it down, shall we? At least for me personally, I do not derive as much pleasure from reading books as I used to. Call me lazy, whatever. I like to listen to the audiobook version of almost anything because the narrator more often than not adds personality to the characters my mind does not. Such as voices, an example of that would be the Harry Potter Audiobooks and The Hobbit audiobooks.

There is nothing better, as far as being able to read a book, than to be able to do what is needed throughout the day and still be able to listen to a book. I can do chores, run errands, and even go to work and still be able to listen to a book, an not miss out on a new or even classic I really enjoy.

I don't know about you, but I find it far more convenient to buy a book online via Amazon or Audible, than to try to find an almost non existent Barnes and Noble or Books-a-Million in my area. I can just click and buy, so why not just get the audio version of whatever book.

In my opinion, most definitely, listening to an audiobook is just as good as reading the paper variant of the same book. Let's break it down, shall we? At least for me personally, I do not derive as much pleasure from reading books as I used to. Call me lazy, whatever. I like to listen to the audiobook version of almost anything because the narrator more often than not adds personality to the characters my mind does not. Such as voices, an example of that would be the Harry Potter Audiobooks and The Hobbit audiobooks.

Do we even have enough time in the day anymore to do what we like, or even need to do. I personally do not. There is nothing better, as far as being able to read a book, than to be able to do what is needed throughout the day and still be able to listen to a book. I can do chores, run errands, and even go to work and still be able to listen to a book, an not miss out on a new or even classic I really enjoy.

I don't know about you, but I find it far more convenient to buy a book online via Amazon or Audible, than to try to find an almost non existent Barnes and Noble or Books-a-Million in my area. I can just click and buy, so why not just get the audio version of whatever book.

Such as voices, an example of that would be the Harry Potter Audiobooks and The Hobbit audiobooks.

There is nothing better, as far as being able to read a book, than to be able to do what is needed throughout the day and still be able to listen to a book. I can do chores, run errands, and even go to work and still be able to listen to a book, an not miss out on a new or even classic I really enjoy.

I don't know about you, but I find it far more convenient to buy a book online via Amazon or Audible, than to try to find an almost non existent Barnes and Noble or Books-a-Million in my area. I can just click and buy, so why not just get the audio version of whatever book.

In my opinion, most definitely, listening to an audiobook is just as good as reading the paper variant of the same book. Let's break it down, shall we? At least for me personally, I do not derive as much pleasure from reading books as I used to. Call me lazy, whatever. I like to listen to the audiobook version of almost anything because the narrator more often than not adds personality to the characters my mind does not. Such as voices, an example of that would be the Harry Potter Audiobooks and The Hobbit audiobooks.

Do we even have enough time in the day anymore to do what we like, or even need to do. I personally do not. There is nothing better, as far as being able to read a book, than to be able to do what is needed throughout the day and still be able to listen to a book. I can do chores, run errands, and even go to work and still be able to listen to a book, an not miss out on a new or even classic I really enjoy.

I don't know about you, but I find it far more convenient to buy a book online via Amazon or Audible, than to try to find an almost non existent Barnes and Noble or Books-a-Million in my area. I can just click and buy, so why not just get the audio version of whatever book.

I like to listen to the audiobook version of almost anything because the narrator more often than not adds personality to the characters my mind does not. Such as voices, an example of that would be the Harry Potter Audiobooks and The Hobbit audiobooks.

Do we even have enough time in the day anymore to do what we like, or even need to do. I personally do not. There is nothing better, as far as being able to read a book, than to be able to do what is needed throughout the day and still be able to listen to a book. I can do chores, run errands, and even go to work and still be able to listen to a book, an not miss out on a new or even classic I really enjoy.

I don't know about you, but I find it far more convenient to buy a book online via Amazon or Audible, than to try to find an almost non existent Barnes and Noble or Books-a-Million in my area. I can just click and buy, so why not just get the audio version of whatever book. 
I think that audiobooks are a great way to get through a book, especially if you are not able to sit down and read it
. I have many of friends who like to read, and all of them think an audiobook is just as good as reading the paper back version of it. We can still have detailed, and in depth conversations about what titles we are reading or listening to.
I personally think that audiobooks are just as good as reading the paper back version of it., is really my final opinion on the matter.",1967,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1453
