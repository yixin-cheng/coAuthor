Rather than seeing people as complex and wonderful, we are presented with a limited and basic message that says, ""here is what I'm good for.""

echnology seems to replace real, deep relationships with superficial ones.
 Because there is such a rapid decline in value of one's interactions on social media, one spends more time on it curating their own perfect image and less time searching for a real relationship with another person. A lot of people act like movie characters, piecing together a picture of themselves that they wish was true, rather than expressing who they truly are.
AManypeople seem to be on the hunt for perfection in the things and people they idolize.
 They are constantly comparing others to a perfect image they have created in their minds or a standard they've set. On social media and dating apps, you see constant comparisons and negativity. Nothing is ever good enough, or someone is always doing better than you.
We focus on finding attention, likes, good pics-instead of finding real, meaningful people to relate to.
   We are so far removed from natural human contact, our sense of security and well-being are suffering because of it. It's no wonder why there's an increase in anxiety and depression.

Technology has encouraged superficiality, dishonesty, and lack of commitment. It's time to turn off our screens and get back to meeting people the old-fashioned way.   After all, we don't want to lose touch with how wonderful the simple pleasures of human contact can be.",1936,[],0,2,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,725
