In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority. It's almost monstrous that someone would care more for the pain ",1408,[],3,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,671

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.

Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own?

Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this",1713,[],1,1,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1062

Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals?

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals?

Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals?

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain.

Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings. They're incapable of caring for anyone else's feelings, human or animal. These people in fact, hate other humans, who they consider to be a distraction from the only thing that's import humans, and are only concerned with the suffering of animals because they can feel good about themselves for caring about something.",2005,[],3,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1364

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings. They're incapable of caring for anyone else's feelings, human or animal.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings. They're incapable of caring for anyone else's feelings, human or animal.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.

Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings. They're incapable of caring for anyone else's feelings, human or animal.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals?

Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings. They're incapable of caring for anyone else's feelings, human or animal. These people in fact, hate other humans, who they consider to be a distraction from the only thing that's important - themselves - and are only concerned with the suffering of animals because by bringing it up, they can re-direct the attention of others, back towards the truly impo",2175,[],0,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1496

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings.

Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings. They're incapable of caring for anyone else's feelings, human or animal. These people in fact, hate other humans, who they consider to be a distraction from the only thing that's important - themselves - and are only concerned with the suffering of animals because by bringing it up, they can re-direct the attention of others, back towards the truly important topic - them.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings. They're incapable of caring for anyone else's feelings, human or animal.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings. They're incapable of caring for anyone else's feelings, human or animal.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings. They're incapable of caring for anyone else's feelings, human or animal.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals?

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings. They're incapable of caring for anyone else's feelings, human or animal. These people in fact, hate other humans, who they consider to be a distraction from the only thing that's important - themselves - and are only concerned with the suffering of animals because by bringing it up, they can re-direct the attention of others, back towards the truly important topic - them.

In short, the phenomenon of caring more for animal suffering than the plight of humans, is a form of narcissism. The appropriat",2323,[],1,1,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1651

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings. They're incapable of caring for anyone else's feelings, human or animal. These people in fact, hate other humans, who they consider to be a distraction from the only thing that's important - themselves - and are only concerned with the suffering of animals because by bringing it up, they can re-direct the attention of others, back towards the truly important topic - them.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings. They're incapable of caring for anyone else's feelings, human or animal. These people in fact, hate other humans, who they consider to be a distraction from the only thing that's important - themselves - and are only concerned with the suffering of animals because by bringing it up, they can re-direct the attention of others, back towards the truly important topic - them.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings. They're incapable of caring for anyone else's feelings, human or animal. These people in fact, hate other humans, who they consider to be a distraction from the only thing that's important - themselves - and are only concerned with the suffering of animals because by bringing it up, they can re-direct the attention of others, back towards the truly important topic - them.

In short, the phenomenon of caring more for animal suffering than the plight of humans, is a form of malignant narcissism. The appropriate response is not to try to understand the narcissist, or tobut rather, to ignore them.",2393,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1691

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings. They're incapable of caring for anyone else's feelings, human or animal.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings. They're incapable of caring for anyone else's feelings, human or animal. These people in fact, hate other humans, who they consider to be a distraction from the only thing that's important - themselves - and are only concerned with the suffering of animals because by bringing it up, they can re-direct the attention of others, back towards the truly important topic - them.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings. They're incapable of caring for anyone else's feelings, human or animal. These people in fact, hate other humans, who they consider to be a distraction from the only thing that's important - themselves - and are only concerned with the suffering of animals because by bringing it up, they can re-direct the attention of others, back towards the truly important topic - them.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings. They're incapable of caring for anyone else's feelings, human or animal. These people in fact, hate other humans, who they consider to be a distraction from the only thing that's important - themselves - and are only concerned with the suffering of animals because by bringing it up, they can re-direct the attention of others, back towards the truly important topic - them.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings.

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals?

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain.

Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings. They're incapable of caring for anyone else's feelings, human or animal. These people in fact, hate other humans, who they consider to be a distraction from the only thing that's important - themselves - and are only concerned with the suffering of animals because by bringing it up, they can re-direct the attention of others, back towards the truly important topic - them.

In short, the phenomenon of caring more for animal suffering than the plight of humans, is a form of malignant narcissism. The appropriate response is not to try to understand the narcissist, or to help them, since personality disorders are generally not responsive to therapy. The appropriate response to ignore them.",2498,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1821

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals.
