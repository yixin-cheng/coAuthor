In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults.

Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults.

Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology,",1920,[],0,,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1766

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults.

Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology, and Art.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults.

Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology, and Art.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology, and Art.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology, and Art.

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology, and Art.

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology, and Art.

My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology, and Art.

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology, and Art. 

These classes have nothing to do with my major, but I can't graduate without them. The more you think about school the more you realize that it's an imperfect solution.

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology, and Art. 

These classes have nothing to do with my major, but I can't graduate without them. The more you think about school the more you realize that it's an imperfect solution.

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults.

Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology, and Art.

Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology, and Art.

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology, and Art. 

These classes have nothing to do with my major, but I can't graduate without them. The more you think about school the more you realize that it's an imperfect solution.

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology, and Art. 

These classes have nothing to do with my major, but I can't graduate without them. The more you think about school the more you realize that it's an imperfect solution.

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology, and Art. 

These classes have nothing to do with my major, but I can't graduate without them. The more you think about school the more you realize that it's an imperfect solution.

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology, and Art.

School should simply be there to teach children the important aspects of life. School should also help children learn to socialize, learn how to behave and learn how to follow rules. That sets a standard that they will have to follow when they become adults.

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology, and Art.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology, and Art. 

These classes have nothing to do with my major, but I can't graduate without them. The more you think about school the more you realize that it's an imperfect solution. 

School should simply be there to teach children the important aspects of life. School should also help children learn to socialize, learn how to behave and learn how to follow rules. That sets a standard that they will have to follow when they become adults.

The school system is valuable, but it bothers me ",2412,[],0,,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,2366

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology, and Art. 

These classes have nothing to do with my major, but I can't graduate without them. The more you think about school the more you realize that it's an imperfect solution. 

School should simply be there to teach children the important aspects of life. School should also help children learn to socialize, learn how to behave and learn how to follow rules. That sets a standard that they will have to follow when they become adults.

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology, and Art. 

These classes have nothing to do with my major, but I can't graduate without them. The more you think about school the more you realize that it's an imperfect solution. 

School should simply be there to teach children the important aspects of life. School should also help children learn to socialize, learn how to behave and learn how to follow rules. That sets a standard that they will have to follow when they become adults.

The school system is valuable, but it bothers me to this day that it is an imperfect one that is built ",2466,[],0,,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,2420

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology, and Art. 

These classes have nothing to do with my major, but I can't graduate without them. The more you think about school the more you realize that it's an imperfect solution. 

School should simply be there to teach children the important aspects of life. School should also help children learn to socialize, learn how to behave and learn how to follow rules. That sets a standard that they will have to follow when they become adults.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School.

My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology, and Art. 

These classes have nothing to do with my major, but I can't graduate without them. The more you think about school the more you realize that it's an imperfect solution. 

School should simply be there to teach children the important aspects of life. School should also help children learn to socialize, learn how to behave and learn how to follow rules. That sets a standard that they will have to follow when they become adults.

The school system is valuable, but it bothers me to this day that it is an imperfect one that is built off of greed and ignorance in my opinion. ",2361,[],0,,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,2473

These classes have nothing to do with my major, but I can't graduate without them. The more you think about school the more you realize that it's an imperfect solution. 

School should simply be there to teach children the important aspects of life. School should also help children learn to socialize, learn how to behave and learn how to follow rules. That sets a standard that they will have to follow when they become adults.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults.

School should simply be there to teach children the important aspects of life. School should also help children learn to socialize, learn how to behave and learn how to follow rules. That sets a standard that they will have to follow when they become adults.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

School should simply be there to teach children the important aspects of life. School should also help children learn to socialize, learn how to behave and learn how to follow rules. That sets a standard that they will have to follow when they become adults.

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.
