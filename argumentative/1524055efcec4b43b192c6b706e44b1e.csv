Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it's not wrong. I think people tend to defend what speaks to their heart, or what they have a connection with. I know that I don't have a connection to humans who are suffering, but I have a connection to animals. I am empathetic to human suffering, but animals are more defenseless and less able to speak for themselves. It really comes down to choice- what do I choose to focus my feelings and efforts on.   And it's not always easy to let go of one advocacy to focus on another. We all have unique interests, viewpoints, and strengths and weaknesses.
