The utility of audiobooks depends upon whether one is listening to fiction or nonfiction. For nonfiction books, listening is a fully functional way of absorbing the material. For fiction, however, listening is a poor substitute for reading.
The reason for this is that the experience of reading a book is not just about absorbing the information., but to read good fiction is to inhabit another world. The reader is transported to the world of the book, and the reader is able to experience the world of the book in a way that is not possible by just listening to a reader.

IN an audiobook the reading experience is necessarily a mediated one. The narrator supplies pacing, emphasis, even accents. The narrator is the voice of the book, and the reader is not.

I think that the narrator's view of the material is valid and important--for them, not necessarily for me. I don't want to hear the narrator's voice, I want to hear the author's.

The utility of audiobooks depends upon whether one is listening to fiction or nonfiction. For nonfiction books, listening is a fully functional way of absorbing the material. For fiction, however, listening is a poor substitute for reading.
The reason for this is that the experience of reading a book is not just about absorbing the information., but to read good fiction is to inhabit another world. I think that listening to a book is a good way to get the gist of the material, but it is not a good way to experience the book as a lived reality. The reader is transported to the world of the book, and the reader is able to experience the world of the book in a way that is not possible by just listening to a narration.

In an audiobook the reading experience is necessarily a mediated one. The narrator supplies pacing, emphasis, even accents. The narrator is the voice of the book, and the reader is not.

I think that the narrator's view of the material is valid and important--for them, not necessarily for me. I don't want to hear the narrator's voice, I want to hear the author's.

Reading a book is an activity that is both creative (supplying our own history and interpretation) and collaborative. But that essential collaboration is with the author--and only with the author.

The utility of audiobooks depends upon whether one is listening to fiction or nonfiction. For nonfiction books, listening is a fully functional way of absorbing the material. For fiction, however, listening is a poor substitute for reading.
The reason for this is that the experience of reading a book is not just about absorbing the information., but to read good fiction is to inhabit another world. I think that listening to a book is a good way to get the gist of the material, but it is not a good way to experience the book as a lived reality. The reader is transported to the world of the book, and the reader is able to experience the world of the book in a way that is not possible by just listening to a narration.

In an audiobook the reading experience is necessarily a mediated one. The narrator supplies pacing, emphasis, even accents. The narrator is the voice of the book, and the reader is not.

I think that the narrator's view of the material is valid and important--for them, not necessarily for me. I don't want to hear the narrator's voice, I want to hear the author's.

Reading a book is an activity that is both creative (supplying our own history and interpretation) and collaborative. But that essential collaboration is with the author--and only with the author.

The utility of audiobooks depends upon whether one is listening to fiction or nonfiction. For nonfiction books, listening is a fully functional way of absorbing the material. For fiction, however, listening is a poor substitute for reading.
The reason for this is that the experience of reading a book is not just about absorbing the information., but to read good fiction is to inhabit another world. I think that listening to a book is a good way to get the gist of the material, but it is not a good way to experience the book as a lived reality. The reader is transported to the world of the book, and the reader is able to experience the world of the book in a way that is not possible by just listening to a narration.

The utility of audiobooks depends upon whether one is listening to fiction or nonfiction. For nonfiction books, listening is a fully functional way of absorbing the material. For fiction, however, listening is a poor substitute for reading.
The reason for this is that the experience of reading a book is not just about absorbing the information., but to read good fiction is to inhabit another world. I think that listening to a book is a good way to get the gist of the material, but it is not a good way to experience the book as a lived reality. The reader is transported to the world of the book, and the reader is able to experience the world of the book in a way that is not possible by just listening to a narration.

In an audiobook the reading experience is necessarily a mediated one. The narrator supplies pacing, emphasis, even accents. The narrator is the voice of the book, and the reader is not.

I think that the narrator's view of the material is valid and important--for them, not necessarily for me. I don't want to hear the narrator's voice, I want to hear the author's.

Reading a book is an activity that is both creative (supplying our own history and interpretation) and collaborative. But that essential collaboration is with the author--and only with the author.

The utility of audiobooks depends upon whether one is listening to fiction or nonfiction. For nonfiction books, listening is a fully functional way of absorbing the material. For fiction, however, listening is a poor substitute for reading.
The reason for this is that the experience of reading a book is not just about absorbing the information., but to read good fiction is to inhabit another world. I think that listening to a book is a good way to get the gist of the material, but it is not a good way to experience the book as a lived reality. The reader is transported to the world of the book, and the reader is able to experience the world of the book in a way that is not possible by just listening to a narration.

In an audiobook the reading experience is necessarily a mediated one. The narrator supplies pacing, emphasis, even accents. The narrator is the voice of the book, and the reader is not.

I think that the narrator's view of the material is valid and important--for them, not necessarily for me. I don't want to hear the narrator's voice, I want to hear the author's.

Reading a book is an activity that is both creative (supplying our own history and interpretation) and collaborative. But that essential collaboration is with the author--and only with the author.

The utility of audiobooks depends upon whether one is listening to fiction or nonfiction. For nonfiction books, listening is a fully functional way of absorbing the material. For fiction, however, listening is a poor substitute for reading.
The reason for this is that the experience of reading a book is not just about absorbing the information., but to read good fiction is to inhabit another world. I think that listening to a book is a good way to get the gist of the material, but it is not a good way to experience the book as a lived reality. The reader is transported to the world of the book, and the reader is able to experience the world of the book in a way that is not possible by just listening to a narration.

In an audiobook the reading experience is necessarily a mediated one. The narrator supplies pacing, emphasis, even accents. The narrator is the voice of the book, and the reader is not.

I think that the narrator's view of the material is valid and important--for them, not necessarily for me. I don't want to hear the narrator's voice, I want to hear the author's.

Reading a book is an activity that is both creative (supplying our own history and interpretation) and collaborative. But that essential collaboration is with the author--and only with the author.

The reader is transported to the world of the book, and the reader is able to experience the world of the book in a way that is not possible by just listening to a narration.

The utility of audiobooks depends upon whether one is listening to fiction or nonfiction. For nonfiction books, listening is a fully functional way of absorbing the material. For fiction, however, listening is a poor substitute for reading.
The reason for this is that the experience of reading a book is not just about absorbing the information., but to read good fiction is to inhabit another world. I think that listening to a book is a good way to get the gist of the material, but it is not a good way to experience the book as a lived reality. The reader is transported to the world of the book, and the reader is able to experience the world of the book in a way that is not possible by just listening to a narration.

In an audiobook the reading experience is necessarily a mediated one. The narrator supplies pacing, emphasis, even accents. The narrator is the voice of the book, and the reader is not.

I think that the narrator's view of the material is valid and important--for them, not necessarily for me. I don't want to hear the narrator's voice, I want to hear the author's.

Reading a book is an activity that is both creative (supplying our own history and interpretation) and collaborative. But that essential collaboration is with the author--and only with the author.

The utility of audiobooks depends upon whether one is listening to fiction or nonfiction. For nonfiction books, listening is a fully functional way of absorbing the material. For fiction, however, listening is a poor substitute for reading.
The reason for this is that the experience of reading a book is not just about absorbing the information., but to read good fiction is to inhabit another world. I think that listening to a book is a good way to get the gist of the material, but it is not a good way to experience the book as a lived reality. The reader is transported to the world of the book, and the reader is able to experience the world of the book in a way that is not possible by just listening to a narration.

In an audiobook the reading experience is necessarily a mediated one. The narrator supplies pacing, emphasis, even accents. The narrator is the voice of the book, and the reader is not.

I think that the narrator's view of the material is valid and important--for them, not necessarily for me. I don't want to hear the narrator's voice, I want to hear the author's.

Reading a book is an activity that is both creative (supplying our own history and interpretation) and collaborative. But that essential collaboration is with the author--and only with the author.

Think about the last time you read--really read-- a book. For me, it was Stephen King's Dark Tower series, thousands of pages and about eight novels. Picking up that story was pleasant because I was entering another world. I did listen to parts if that audiobook, and was underwhelmed because the voice of the narrator was not my voice.

The utility of audiobooks depends upon whether one is listening to fiction or nonfiction. For nonfiction books, listening is a fully functional way of absorbing the material. For fiction, however, listening is a poor substitute for reading.
The reason for this is that the experience of reading a book is not just about absorbing the information., but to read good fiction is to inhabit another world. I think that listening to a book is a good way to get the gist of the material, but it is not a good way to experience the book as a lived reality. The reader is transported to the world of the book, and the reader is able to experience the world of the book in a way that is not possible by just listening to a narration.

In an audiobook the reading experience is necessarily a mediated one. The narrator supplies pacing, emphasis, even accents. The narrator is the voice of the book, and the reader is not.

I think that the narrator's view of the material is valid and important--for them, not necessarily for me. I don't want to hear the narrator's voice, I want to hear the author's.

Reading a book is an activity that is both creative (supplying our own history and interpretation) and collaborative. But that essential collaboration is with the author--and only with the author.

Think about the last time you read--really read-- a book. For me, it was Stephen King's Dark Tower series, thousands of pages and about eight novels. Picking up that story was pleasant because I was entering another world. I did listen to parts if that audiobook, and was underwhelmed because the voice of the narrator was not my voice.

The utility of audiobooks depends upon whether one is listening to fiction or nonfiction. For nonfiction books, listening is a fully functional way of absorbing the material. For fiction, however, listening is a poor substitute for reading.
The reason for this is that the experience of reading a book is not just about absorbing the information., but to read good fiction is to inhabit another world. I think that listening to a book is a good way to get the gist of the material, but it is not a good way to experience the book as a lived reality. The reader is transported to the world of the book, and the reader is able to experience the world of the book in a way that is not possible by just listening to a narration.

In an audiobook the reading experience is necessarily a mediated one. The narrator supplies pacing, emphasis, even accents. The narrator is the voice of the book, and the reader is not.

I think that the narrator's view of the material is valid and important--for them, not necessarily for me. I don't want to hear the narrator's voice, I want to hear the author's.

Reading a book is an activity that is both creative (supplying our own history and interpretation) and collaborative. But that essential collaboration is with the author--and only with the author.

The utility of audiobooks depends upon whether one is listening to fiction or nonfiction. For nonfiction books, listening is a fully functional way of absorbing the material. For fiction, however, listening is a poor substitute for reading.
The reason for this is that the experience of reading a book is not just about absorbing the information., but to read good fiction is to inhabit another world. I think that listening to a book is a good way to get the gist of the material, but it is not a good way to experience the book as a lived reality. The reader is transported to the world of the book, and the reader is able to experience the world of the book in a way that is not possible by just listening to a narration.

In an audiobook the reading experience is necessarily a mediated one. The narrator supplies pacing, emphasis, even accents. The narrator is the voice of the book, and the reader is not.

I think that the narrator's view of the material is valid and important--for them, not necessarily for me. I don't want to hear the narrator's voice, I want to hear the author's.

Reading a book is an activity that is both creative (supplying our own history and interpretation) and collaborative. But that essential collaboration is with the author--and only with the author.

Think about the last time you read--really read-- a book. For me, it was Stephen King's Dark Tower series, thousands of pages and about eight novels. Picking up that story was pleasant because I was entering another world. I did listen to parts if that audiobook, and was underwhelmed because the voice of the narrator was not my voice.

The utility of audiobooks depends upon whether one is listening to fiction or nonfiction. For nonfiction books, listening is a fully functional way of absorbing the material. For fiction, however, listening is a poor substitute for reading.
The reason for this is that the experience of reading a book is not just about absorbing the information., but to read good fiction is to inhabit another world. I think that listening to a book is a good way to get the gist of the material, but it is not a good way to experience the book as a lived reality. The reader is transported to the world of the book, and the reader is able to experience the world of the book in a way that is not possible by just listening to a narration.

In an audiobook the reading experience is necessarily a mediated one. The narrator supplies pacing, emphasis, even accents. The narrator is the voice of the book, and the reader is not.

I think that the narrator's view of the material is valid and important--for them, not necessarily for me. I don't want to hear the narrator's voice, I want to hear the author's.

The utility of audiobooks depends upon whether one is listening to fiction or nonfiction. For nonfiction books, listening is a fully functional way of absorbing the material. For fiction, however, listening is a poor substitute for reading.
The reason for this is that the experience of reading a book is not just about absorbing the information., but to read good fiction is to inhabit another world. I think that listening to a book is a good way to get the gist of the material, but it is not a good way to experience the book as a lived reality. The reader is transported to the world of the book, and the reader is able to experience the world of the book in a way that is not possible by just listening to a narration.

In an audiobook the reading experience is necessarily a mediated one. The narrator supplies pacing, emphasis, even accents. The narrator is the voice of the book, and the reader is not.

I think that the narrator's view of the material is valid and important--for them, not necessarily for me. I don't want to hear the narrator's voice, I want to hear the author's.

Reading a book is an activity that is both creative (supplying our own history and interpretation) and collaborative. But that essential collaboration is with the author--and only with the author.

The utility of audiobooks depends upon whether one is listening to fiction or nonfiction. For nonfiction books, listening is a fully functional way of absorbing the material. For fiction, however, listening is a poor substitute for reading.
The reason for this is that the experience of reading a book is not just about absorbing the information., but to read good fiction is to inhabit another world. I think that listening to a book is a good way to get the gist of the material, but it is not a good way to experience the book as a lived reality. The reader is transported to the world of the book, and the reader is able to experience the world of the book in a way that is not possible by just listening to a narration.

In an audiobook the reading experience is necessarily a mediated one. The narrator supplies pacing, emphasis, even accents. The narrator is the voice of the book, and the reader is not.

I think that the narrator's view of the material is valid and important--for them, not necessarily for me. I don't want to hear the narrator's voice, I want to hear the author's.

Reading a book is an activity that is both creative (supplying our own history and interpretation) and collaborative. But that essential collaboration is with the author--and only with the author.

The utility of audiobooks depends upon whether one is listening to fiction or nonfiction. For nonfiction books, listening is a fully functional way of absorbing the material. For fiction, however, listening is a poor substitute for reading.
The reason for this is that the experience of reading a book is not just about absorbing the information., but to read good fiction is to inhabit another world. I think that listening to a book is a good way to get the gist of the material, but it is not a good way to experience the book as a lived reality. The reader is transported to the world of the book, and the reader is able to experience that world in a way that is not possible by just listening to a narration.

In an audiobook the reading experience is necessarily a mediated one. The narrator supplies pacing, emphasis, even accents. The narrator is the voice of the book, and the reader is not.

I think that the narrator's view of the material is valid and important--for them, not necessarily for me. I don't want to hear the narrator's voice, I want to hear the author's.

Reading a book is an activity that is both creative (supplying our own history and interpretation) and collaborative. But that essential collaboration is with the author--and only with the author.

Think about the last time you read--really read-- a book. For me, it was Stephen King's Dark Tower series, thousands of pages over eight novels. Picking up that story was pleasant because I was entering another world. I did listen to parts if that audiobook, and was underwhelmed because the voice of the narrator was not my voice.

The utility of audiobooks depends upon whether one is listening to fiction or nonfiction. For nonfiction books, listening is a fully functional way of absorbing the material. For fiction, however, listening is a poor substitute for reading.
The reason for this is that the experience of reading a book is not just about absorbing the information., but to read good fiction is to inhabit another world. I think that listening to a book is a good way to get the gist of the material, but it is not a good way to experience the book as a lived reality. The reader is transported to the world of the book, and the reader is able to experience that world in a way that is not possible by just listening to a narration.

In an audiobook the reading experience is necessarily a mediated one. The narrator supplies pacing, emphasis, even accents. The narrator is the voice of the book, and the reader is not.

I think that the narrator's view of the material is valid and important--for them, not necessarily for me. I don't want to hear the narrator's voice, I want to hear the author's.

Reading a book is an activity that is both creative (supplying our own history and interpretation) and collaborative. But that essential collaboration is with the author--and only with the author.

Think about the last time you read--really read-- a book. For me, it was Stephen King's Dark Tower series, thousands of pages over eight novels. Picking up that story was pleasant because I was entering another world. I did listen to parts if that audiobook, and was underwhelmed because the voice of the narrator was not the voice I had h.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

The utility of audiobooks depends upon whether one is listening to fiction or nonfiction. For nonfiction books, listening is a fully functional way of absorbing the material. For fiction, however, listening is a poor substitute for reading.
The reason for this is that the experience of reading a book is not just about absorbing the information., but to read good fiction is to inhabit another world. I think that listening to a book is a good way to get the gist of the material, but it is not a good way to experience the book as a lived reality. The reader is transported to the world of the book, and the reader is able to experience that world in a way that is not possible by just listening to a narration.

In an audiobook the reading experience is necessarily a mediated one. The narrator supplies pacing, emphasis, even accents. The narrator is the voice of the book, and the reader is not.

I think that the narrator's view of the material is valid and important--for them, not necessarily for me. I don't want to hear the narrator's voice, I want to hear the author's.

Reading a book is an activity that is both creative (supplying our own history and interpretation) and collaborative. But that essential collaboration is with the author--and only with the author.

Think about the last time you read--really read-- a book. For me, it was Stephen King's Dark Tower series, thousands of pages over eight novels. Picking up that story was pleasant because I was entering another world. I did listen to parts if that audiobook, and was underwhelmed because the voice of the narrator was not the voice I had heard in my head.
