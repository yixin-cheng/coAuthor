The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we should embrace our screens. All of human history has seen paradigm supplant paradigm: rock paintings, then oral histories, then the printing press, then radio, then TV, then the computer, then AR and AI and social media. Are any of these ""better"" than the others? Or is each the product of a unique zeitgeist that will never come again?
The answer is that each is a product of its time and place, and each has its own unique value.


Looking forward, I am sure than in 100 years, in 200 years, all manner of human interaction will take place of which we currently only dream. Brains in vats (how's that for isolation)? Personality uploads at the moment of death? Brain transplants? No doubt if any of these come to pass, they will be bemoaned as the end of ""true"" humanity, of ""true"" human interaction. But they won't be, any more than pay TV was the end of the cinema!
But for now, I am happy to be on my screen., and my phone, and my computer.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.
