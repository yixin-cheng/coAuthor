In my opinion, listening gives me at least a broad range of thinking, When i read a book my mind tend to stray a lot but when i listening i feel i can imagine myself in the story and play the role of the character. I also have the option of not being tethered to a book and can walk around listening to it.  also think listening is good for people who can't read or have a hard time reading.
 For me listening to an audiobook on the treadmill just makes the time go buy super fast and its also a time killer to say. I am usually a visually person meaning videos help me cram info better than writing , i would also say i'm a listening person as well . So when listening i could hold things better than reading it. I also think listening to an audiobook is good for people who are in a hurry and don't have time to read. There are a wide array of advantages of listening, meaning it can be done on the go and from everywhere. When i have the choice i always go for listening to books and or podcast.

In my opinion, listening gives me at least a broad range of thinking, When i read a book my mind tend to stray a lot but when i listening i feel i can imagine myself in the story and play the role of the character. I also have the option of not being tethered to a book and can walk around listening to it.  also think listening is good for people who can't read or have a hard time reading.
 For me listening to an audiobook on the treadmill just makes the time go buy super fast and its also a time killer to say. I am usually a visually person meaning videos help me cram info better than writing , i would also say i'm a listening person as well . So when listening i could hold things better than reading it. I also think listening to an audiobook is good for people who are in a hurry and don't have time to read. There are a wide array of advantages of listening, meaning it can be done on the go and from everywhere. When i have the choice i always go for listening to books and or podcast.

In my opinion, listening gives me at least a broad range of thinking, When i read a book my mind tend to stray a lot but when i listening i feel i can imagine myself in the story and play the role of the character. I also have the option of not being tethered to a book and can walk around listening to it.  also think listening is good for people who can't read or have a hard time reading.
 For me listening to an audiobook on the treadmill just makes the time go buy super fast and its also a time killer to say. I am usually a visually person meaning videos help me cram info better than writing , i would also say i'm a listening person as well . So when listening i could hold things better than reading it.

In my opinion, listening gives me at least a broad range of thinking, When i read a book my mind tend to stray a lot but when i listening i feel i can imagine myself in the story and play the role of the character. I also have the option of not being tethered to a book and can walk around listening to it.  also think listening is good for people who can't read or have a hard time reading.
 For me listening to an audiobook on the treadmill just makes the time go buy super fast and its also a time killer to say. I am usually a visually person meaning videos help me cram info better than writing , i would also say i'm a listening person as well . So when listening i could hold things better than reading it. I also think listening to an audiobook is good for people who are in a hurry and don't have time to read. There are a wide array of advantages of listening, meaning it can be done on the go and from everywhere. When i have the choice i always go for listening to books and or podcast. The Audible app is godsent in my opinion, i find myself listening to so much more books that are sometimes free or have a promotion. I also find myself not buying the amount of books that i use to in the past since this new technology came about. I also find myself listening to books that i wouldn't have read in the past. I will also be teaching my kids how to listen more to audiobooks as they are not the ones to sit and read a book for hours on end anymore. So i feel there is a lot of good to come out of listening as they can do it while on the way and back from school . I also feel that listening to audiobooks is a great way to get kids into reading and or learning. All in all s",1949,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1681

In my opinion, listening gives me at least a broad range of thinking, When i read a book my mind tend to stray a lot but when i listening i feel i can imagine myself in the story and play the role of the character. I also have the option of not being tethered to a book and can walk around listening to it.  also think listening is good for people who can't read or have a hard time reading.
 For me listening to an audiobook on the treadmill just makes the time go buy super fast and its also a time killer to say. I am usually a visually person meaning videos help me cram info better than writing , i would also say i'm a listening person as well . So when listening i could hold things better than reading it. I also think listening to an audiobook is good for people who are in a hurry and don't have time to read. There are a wide array of advantages of listening, meaning it can be done on the go and from everywhere. When i have the choice i always go for listening to books and or podcast. The Audible app is godsent in my opinion, i find myself listening to so much more books that are sometimes free or have a promotion. I also find myself not buying the amount of books that i use to in the past since this new technology came about. I also find myself listening to books that i wouldn't have read in the past. I will also be teaching my kids how to listen more to audiobooks as they are not the ones to sit and read a book for hours on end anymore. So i feel there is a lot of good to come out of listening as they can do it while on the way and back from school . I also feel that listening to audiobooks is a great way to get kids into reading and or learning. All in all such a great way",1964,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1696

In my opinion, listening gives me at least a broad range of thinking, When i read a book my mind tend to stray a lot but when i listening i feel i can imagine myself in the story and play the role of the character. I also have the option of not being tethered to a book and can walk around listening to it.  also think listening is good for people who can't read or have a hard time reading.
 For me listening to an audiobook on the treadmill just makes the time go buy super fast and its also a time killer to say. I am usually a visually person meaning videos help me cram info better than writing , i would also say i'm a listening person as well . So when listening i could hold things better than reading it. I also think listening to an audiobook is good for people who are in a hurry and don't have time to read. There are a wide array of advantages of listening, meaning it can be done on the go and from everywhere. When i have the choice i always go for listening to books and or podcast. The Audible app is godsent in my opinion, i find myself listening to so much more books that are sometimes free or have a promotion. I also find myself not buying the amount of books that i use to in the past since this new technology came about. I also find myself listening to books that i wouldn't have read in the past. I will also be teaching my kids how to listen more to audiobooks as they are not the ones to sit and read a book for hours on end anymore. So i feel there is a lot of good to come out of listening as they can do it while on the way and back from school . I also feel that listening to audiobooks is a great way to get kids into reading and or learning.
