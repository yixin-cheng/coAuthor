They bid for the best. The athletes would receive no compensation until they graduate, again, which would be a percentage of tickets sold.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid over and above their scholarships. They should be paid a percentage of ticket sales. I do not agree that the broader community would be harmed. This is real life. Times change. It is fair that if the college makes a great sum of income, some of it go to the players. Colleges in bidding wars? They do that anyway, but without money. They bid for the best. The athletes would receive no compensation until they graduate, again, which would be a percentage of tickets sold.
