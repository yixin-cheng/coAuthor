In my opinion, I would not say that we are bad citizens for watching the news. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, but I do not think that it is necessary for everyone to watch the news because my kids do not watch the news, just like normal kids.

Even more so, since everyone consumes the news in one way or another, I do not think you can call anyone a bad citizen based on their consumption or lack there of, of current world events.

In my opinion, I would not say that we are bad citizens for watching the news.
