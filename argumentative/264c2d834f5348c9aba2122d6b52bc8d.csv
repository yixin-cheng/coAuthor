In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. I believe that the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans and the chance to get a college education is enough. 
I believe that paying college athletes would ruin college sports.
 I believe that paying college athletes would cause a bidding war between colleges. Colleges would have to overpay for a handful of athletes, and have to cut funding for other activities.

There would be no ""underdog with a chance to win"", no dark horses, just the haves, and the have-nots. We'd have a few super-programs who dominated everything due to their excessive cash.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. I believe that the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans and the chance to get a college education is enough. 
I believe that paying college athletes would ruin college sports.
 I believe that paying college athletes would cause a bidding war between colleges. Colleges would have to overpay for a handful of athletes, and have to cut funding for other activities.

There would be no ""underdog with a chance to win"", no dark horses, just the haves, and the have-nots. We'd have a few super-programs who dominated everything due to their excessive cash-bought top talent.  The money would go to a select few athletes, leaving the rest of the team with less. In a society already dominated by money, we'd just be allowing another thing to become ""pay-to-win"".
IPying college athletes would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.
 Rural and poorer schools would have losing teams, harming the opportunities for motivation and success of some students.  There would be inequality in payment, and inequality in opportunity.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. I believe that the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans and the chance to get a college education is enough. 
I believe that paying college athletes would ruin college sports.
 I believe that paying college athletes would cause a bidding war between colleges. Colleges would have to overpay for a handful of athletes, and have to cut funding for other activities.

There would be no ""underdog with a chance to win"", no dark horses, just the haves, and the have-nots. We'd have a few super-programs who dominated everything due to their excessive cash-bought top talent.  The money would go to a select few athletes, leaving the rest of the team with less. In a society already dominated by money, we'd just be allowing another thing to become ""pay-to-win"".
IPying college athletes would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.
 Rural and poorer schools would have losing teams, harming the opportunities for motivation and success of some students.  There would be inequality in payment, and inequality in opportunity.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. I believe that the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans and the chance to get a college education is enough. 
I believe that paying college athletes would ruin college sports.
 I believe that paying college athletes would cause a bidding war between colleges. Colleges would have to overpay for a handful of athletes, and have to cut funding for other activities.

There would be no ""underdog with a chance to win"", no dark horses, just the haves, and the have-nots. We'd have a few super-programs who dominated everything due to their excessive cash-bought top talent.  The money would go to a select few athletes, leaving the rest of the team with less. In a society already dominated by money, we'd just be allowing another thing to become ""pay-to-win"".
IPying college athletes would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.
 Rural and poorer schools would have losing teams, harming the opportunities for motivation and success of some students.  There would be inequality in payment, and inequality in opportunity.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. I believe that the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans and the chance to get a college education is enough. 
I believe that paying college athletes would ruin college sports.
 I believe that paying college athletes would cause a bidding war between colleges. Colleges would have to overpay for a handful of athletes, and have to cut funding for other activities.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. I believe that the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans and the chance to get a college education is enough. 
I believe that paying college athletes would ruin college sports.

There would be no ""underdog with a chance to win"", no dark horses, just the haves, and the have-nots.

IPying college athletes would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.
 Rural and poorer schools would have losing teams, harming the opportunities for motivation and success of some students.  There would be inequality in payment, and inequality in opportunity.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. I believe that the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans and the chance to get a college education is enough. 
I believe that paying college athletes would ruin college sports.
 I believe that paying college athletes would cause a bidding war between colleges. Colleges would have to overpay for a handful of athletes, and have to cut funding for other activities.

We'd have a few super-programs who dominated everything due to their excessive cash-bought top talent.  The money would go to a select few athletes, leaving the rest of the team with less.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. I believe that the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans and the chance to get a college education is enough. 
I believe that paying college athletes would ruin college sports.
 I believe that paying college athletes would cause a bidding war between colleges. Colleges would have to overpay for a handful of athletes, and have to cut funding for other activities.

There would be no ""underdog with a chance to win"", no dark horses, just the haves, and the have-nots. We'd have a few super-programs who dominated everything due to their excessive cash-bought top talent.  The money would go to a select few athletes, leaving the rest of the team with less. In a society already dominated by money, we'd just be allowing another thing to become ""pay-to-win"".
IPying college athletes would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.
 Rural and poorer schools would have losing teams, harming the opportunities for motivation and success of some students.  There would be inequality in payment, and inequality in opportunity.  
The NCAA is a non-profit organization.
 It is a community of schools, and the athletes are part of that community. It returns all of its profits to the schools and the furthering of athletic programs. It works to keep schools a place of learning, not a place of money and greed. 
I believe that the NCAA is a great organization, and I believe that it should stay that way.

 I believe that paying college athletes would cause a bidding war between colleges. Colleges would have to overpay for a handful of athletes, and have to cut funding for other activities.

There would be no ""underdog with a chance to win"", no dark horses, just the haves, and the have-nots. We'd have a few super-programs who dominated everything due to their excessive cash-bought top talent.  The money would go to a select few athletes, leaving the rest of the team with less. In a society already dominated by money, we'd just be allowing another thing to become ""pay-to-win"".
IPying college athletes would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.
 Rural and poorer schools would have losing teams, harming the opportunities for motivation and success of some students.  There would be inequality in payment, and inequality in opportunity.  
The NCAA is a non-profit organization.
 It is a community of schools, and the athletes are part of that community. It returns all of its profits to the schools and the furthering of athletic programs. It works to keep schools a place of learning, not a place of money and greed. 
I believe that the NCAA is a great organization, and I believe that it should stay that way.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. I believe that the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans and the chance to get a college education is enough.

IPying college athletes would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.
 Rural and poorer schools would have losing teams, harming the opportunities for motivation and success of some students.  There would be inequality in payment, and inequality in opportunity.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. I believe that the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans and the chance to get a college education is enough. 
I believe that paying college athletes would ruin college sports.
 I believe that paying college athletes would cause a bidding war between colleges. Colleges would have to overpay for a handful of athletes, and have to cut funding for other activities.

There would be no ""underdog with a chance to win"", no dark horses, just the haves, and the have-nots. We'd have a few super-programs who dominated everything due to their excessive cash-bought top talent.  The money would go to a select few athletes, leaving the rest of the team with less. In a society already dominated by money, we'd just be allowing another thing to become ""pay-to-win"".
IPying college athletes would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.
 Rural and poorer schools would have losing teams, harming the opportunities for motivation and success of some students.  There would be inequality in payment, and inequality in opportunity.  
The NCAA is a non-profit organization.
 It is a community of schools, and the athletes are part of that community. It returns all of its profits to the schools and the furthering of athletic programs. It works to keep schools a place of learning, not a place of money and greed.

I believe that paying college athletes would ruin college sports.
 I believe that paying college athletes would cause a bidding war between colleges. Colleges would have to overpay for a handful of athletes, and have to cut funding for other activities.

I believe that paying college athletes would ruin college sports.
 I believe that paying college athletes would cause a bidding war between colleges. Colleges would have to overpay for a handful of athletes, and have to cut funding for other activities.

We'd have a few super-programs who dominated everything due to their excessive cash-bought top talent.  The money would go to a select few athletes, leaving the rest of the team with less.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. I believe that the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans, training with a professional program and and the chance to get a college education is enough. 
I believe that paying college athletes would ruin college sports.
 I believe that paying college athletes would cause a bidding war between colleges. Colleges would have to overpay for a handful of athletes, and have to cut funding for other activities.

There would be no ""underdog with a chance to win"", no dark horses, just the haves, and the have-nots. We'd have a few super-programs who dominated everything due to their excessive cash-bought top talent.  The money would go to a select few athletes, leaving the rest of the team with less. In a society already dominated by money, we'd just be allowing another thing to become ""pay-to-win"".
IPying college athletes would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.
 Rural and poorer schools would have losing teams, harming the opportunities for motivation and success of some students.  There would be inequality in payment, and inequality in opportunity.  
The NCAA is a non-profit organization.
 It is a community of schools, and the athletes are part of that community. It returns all of its profits to the schools and the furthering of athletic programs. It works to keep schools a place of learning, not a place of money and business. 
I believe that the NCAA is a great organization, and I believe that it should stay that way.
