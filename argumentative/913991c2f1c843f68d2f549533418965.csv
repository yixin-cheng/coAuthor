The most important thing I learned in school was how to think. That may sound strange, but thinking is a skill not everyone has. Many people viscerally react, trusting their instincts or emotions, rather than to carefully and rationally choose between alternatives.
But what is the alternative to making careful, rational decisions?
 Addiction, poverty, illness, and conflict all come to mind. All result from choices the individual made, and can either be based upon his emotional state at the time or else his rational thought.

Take cocaine. I may know its bad. I may know it is expensive. And I may know it has been the ruin of many, causing poverty, imprisonment, divorce, addiction, heart problems and death. So if someone offers me a ""toot"" of the ""white lady"" or ""yayo"" I do not in any sense think of it as a good thing because my mind knows the consequences. But if I act from my gut--if I am bored, say, or angry--one sniff can lean to decades of misery for me and my loved ones.
BBut, bcause I have spent my life learning to think, I can overcome my emotions in the presence of the drug and recognize that it is not worth
 it, and absent myself from any temptation.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to think. That may sound strange, but thinking is a skill not everyone has. Many people viscerally react, trusting their instincts or emotions, rather than to carefully and rationally choose between alternatives.
But what is the alternative to making careful, rational decisions?
 Addiction, poverty, illness, and conflict all come to mind. All result from choices the individual made, and can either be based upon his emotional state at the time or else his rational thought.

Take cocaine. I may know its bad. I may know it is expensive. And I may know it has been the ruin of many, causing poverty, imprisonment, divorce, addiction, heart problems and death. So if someone offers me a ""toot"" of the ""white lady"" or ""yayo"" I do not in any sense think of it as a good thing because my mind knows the consequences. But if I act from my gut--if I am bored, say, or angry--one sniff can lean to decades of misery for me and my loved ones.
BBut, bcause I have spent my life learning to think, I can overcome my emotions in the presence of the drug and recognize that it is not worth
 it, and absent myself from any temptation.

But if I act from my gut--if I am bored, say, or angry--one sniff can lean to decades of misery for me and my loved ones.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to think. That may sound strange, but thinking is a skill not everyone has. Many people viscerally react, trusting their instincts or emotions, rather than to carefully and rationally choose between alternatives.

 Addiction, poverty, illness, and conflict all come to mind. All result from choices the individual made, and can either be based upon his emotional state at the time or else his rational thought.

Take cocaine. I may know its bad. I may know it is expensive. And I may know it has been the ruin of many, causing poverty, imprisonment, divorce, addiction, heart problems and death. So if someone offers me a ""toot"" of the ""white lady"" or ""yayo"" I do not in any sense think of it as a good thing because my mind knows the consequences.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to think. That may sound strange, but thinking is a skill not everyone has. Many people viscerally react, trusting their instincts or emotions, rather than to carefully and rationally choose between alternatives.
But what is the alternative to making careful, rational decisions?
 Addiction, poverty, illness, and conflict all come to mind. All result from choices the individual made, and can either be based upon his emotional state at the time or else his rational thought.

Take cocaine. I may know its bad. I may know it is expensive. And I may know it has been the ruin of many, causing poverty, imprisonment, divorce, addiction, heart problems and death. So if someone offers me a ""toot"" of the ""white lady"" or ""yayo"" I do not in any sense think of it as a good thing because my mind knows the consequences. But if I act from my gut--if I am bored, say, or angry--one sniff can lean to decades of misery for me and my loved ones.
BBut, bcause I have spent my life learning to think, I can overcome my emotions in the presence of the drug and recognize that it is not worth
 it, and absent myself from any temptation.

In that case, leaning how to think can save my life. This is true for all decisions, large and small. Behind every decision to enter college, get married, or change professions is a series of decisions about what we value and how best to achieve our goals.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to think. That may sound strange, but thinking is a skill not everyone has. Many people viscerally react, trusting their instincts or emotions, rather than to carefully and rationally choose between alternatives.
But what is the alternative to making careful, rational decisions?
 Addiction, poverty, illness, and conflict all come to mind. All result from choices the individual made, and can either be based upon his emotional state at the time or else his rational thought.

Take cocaine. I may know its bad. I may know it is expensive. And I may know it has been the ruin of many, causing poverty, imprisonment, divorce, addiction, heart problems and death. So if someone offers me a ""toot"" of the ""white lady"" or ""yayo"" I do not in any sense think of it as a good thing because my mind knows the consequences. But if I act from my gut--if I am bored, say, or angry--one sniff can lean to decades of misery for me and my loved ones.
BBut, bcause I have spent my life learning to think, I can overcome my emotions in the presence of the drug and recognize that it is not worth
 it, and absent myself from any temptation.

In that case, leaning how to think can save my life. This is true for all decisions, large and small. Behind every decision to enter college, get married, or change professions is a series of decisions about what we value and how best to achieve our goals.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to think. That may sound strange, but thinking is a skill not everyone has. Many people viscerally react, trusting their instincts or emotions, rather than to carefully and rationally choose between alternatives.
But what is the alternative to making careful, rational decisions?
 Addiction, poverty, illness, and conflict all come to mind. All result from choices the individual made, and can either be based upon his emotional state at the time or else his rational thought.

Take cocaine. I may know its bad. I may know it is expensive. And I may know it has been the ruin of many, causing poverty, imprisonment, divorce, addiction, heart problems and death. So if someone offers me a ""toot"" of the ""white lady"" or ""yayo"" I do not in any sense think of it as a good thing because my mind knows the consequences. But if I act from my gut--if I am bored, say, or angry--one sniff can lean to decades of misery for me and my loved ones.
BBut, bcause I have spent my life learning to think, I can overcome my emotions in the presence of the drug and recognize that it is not worth
 it, and absent myself from any temptation.

In that case, leaning how to think can save my life. This is true for all decisions, large and small. Behind every decision to enter college, get married, or change professions is a series of decisions about what we value and how best to achieve our goals.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to think. That may sound strange, but thinking is a skill not everyone has. Many people viscerally react, trusting their instincts or emotions, rather than to carefully and rationally choose between alternatives.
But what is the alternative to making careful, rational decisions?
 Addiction, poverty, illness, and conflict all come to mind. All result from choices the individual made, and can either be based upon his emotional state at the time or else his rational thought.

Take cocaine. I may know its bad. I may know it is expensive. And I may know it has been the ruin of many, causing poverty, imprisonment, divorce, addiction, heart problems and death. So if someone offers me a ""toot"" of the ""white lady"" or ""yayo"" I do not in any sense think of it as a good thing because my mind knows the consequences. But if I act from my gut--if I am bored, say, or angry--one sniff can lean to decades of misery for me and my loved ones.
BBut, bcause I have spent my life learning to think, I can overcome my emotions in the presence of the drug and recognize that it is not worth
 it, and absent myself from any temptation.

In that case, leaning how to think can save my life. This is true for all decisions, large and small. Behind every decision to enter college, get married, or change professions is a series of decisions about what we value and how best to achieve our goals.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to think. That may sound strange, but thinking is a skill not everyone has. Many people viscerally react, trusting their instincts or emotions, rather than to carefully and rationally choose between alternatives.
But what is the alternative to making careful, rational decisions?
 Addiction, poverty, illness, and conflict all come to mind. All result from choices the individual made, and can either be based upon his emotional state at the time or else his rational thought.

Take cocaine. I may know its bad. I may know it is expensive. And I may know it has been the ruin of many, causing poverty, imprisonment, divorce, addiction, heart problems and death. So if someone offers me a ""toot"" of the ""white lady"" or ""yayo"" I do not in any sense think of it as a good thing because my mind knows the consequences. But if I act from my gut--if I am bored, say, or angry--one sniff can lean to decades of misery for me and my loved ones.
BBut, bcause I have spent my life learning to think, I can overcome my emotions in the presence of the drug and recognize that it is not worth
 it, and absent myself from any temptation.

In that case, leaning how to think can save my life. This is true for all decisions, large and small. Behind every decision to enter college, get married, or change professions is a series of decisions about what we value and how best to achieve our goals.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to think. That may sound strange, but thinking is a skill not everyone has. Many people viscerally react, trusting their instincts or emotions, rather than to carefully and rationally choose between alternatives.
But what is the alternative to making careful, rational decisions?
 Addiction, poverty, illness, and conflict all come to mind. All result from choices the individual made, and can either be based upon his emotional state at the time or else his rational thought.

Take cocaine. I may know its bad. I may know it is expensive. And I may know it has been the ruin of many, causing poverty, imprisonment, divorce, addiction, heart problems and death. So if someone offers me a ""toot"" of the ""white lady"" or ""yayo"" I do not in any sense think of it as a good thing because my mind knows the consequences. But if I act from my gut--if I am bored, say, or angry--one sniff can lean to decades of misery for me and my loved ones.
BBut, bcause I have spent my life learning to think, I can overcome my emotions in the presence of the drug and recognize that it is not worth
 it, and absent myself from any temptation.

In that case, leaning how to think can save my life. This is true for all decisions, large and small. Behind every decision to enter college, get married, or change professions is a series of decisions about what we value and how best to achieve our goals.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to think. That may sound strange, but thinking is a skill not everyone has. Many people viscerally react, trusting their instincts or emotions, rather than to carefully and rationally choose between alternatives.
But what is the alternative to making careful, rational decisions?
 Addiction, poverty, illness, and conflict all come to mind. All result from choices the individual made, and can either be based upon his emotional state at the time or else his rational thought.

Take cocaine. I may know its bad. I may know it is expensive. And I may know it has been the ruin of many, causing poverty, imprisonment, divorce, addiction, heart problems and death. So if someone offers me a ""toot"" of the ""white lady"" or ""yayo"" I do not in any sense think of it as a good thing because my mind knows the consequences. But if I act from my gut--if I am bored, say, or angry--one sniff can lean to decades of misery for me and my loved ones.
BBut, bcause I have spent my life learning to think, I can overcome my emotions in the presence of the drug and recognize that it is not worth
 it, and absent myself from any temptation.

In that case, leaning how to think can save my life. This is true for all decisions, large and small. Behind every decision to enter college, get married, or change professions is a series of decisions about what we value and how best to achieve our goals.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to think. That may sound strange, but thinking is a skill not everyone has. Many people viscerally react, trusting their instincts or emotions, rather than carefully and rationally choosing between alternatives.
BWat is the alternative to making careful, rational decisions?
 Addiction, poverty, illness, and conflict all come to mind. All result from choices the individual made, and can either be based upon his emotional state at the time or else his rational thought.

Take cocaine. I may know its bad. I may know it is expensive. And I may know it has been the ruin of many, causing poverty, imprisonment, divorce, addiction, heart problems and death. So if someone offers me a ""toot"" of the ""white lady"" or ""yayo"" I do not in any sense think of it as a good thing because my mind knows the consequences. But if I act from my gut--if I am bored, say, or angry--one sniff can lean to decades of misery for me and my loved ones.
BBut, bcause I have spent my life learning to think, I can overcome my emotions in the presence of the drug and recognize that it is not worth
 it, and absent myself from any temptation.

In that case, leaning how to think can save my life. This is true for all decisions, large and small. Behind every decision to enter college, get married, or change professions is a series of decisions about what we value and how best to achieve our goals.

The most important thing I learned in school was how to think. That may sound strange, but thinking is a skill not everyone has. Many people viscerally react, trusting their instincts or emotions, rather than carefully and rationally choosing between alternatives.
BWat iare he alternative sto making careful, rational decisions?
 Addiction, poverty, illness, and conflict all come to mind. All result from choices the individual made, and can either be based upon his emotional state at the time or else his rational thought.

Take cocaine. I may know its bad. I may know it is expensive. And I may know it has been the ruin of many, causing poverty, imprisonment, divorce, addiction, heart problems and death. So if someone offers me a ""toot"" of the ""white lady"" or ""yayo"" I do not in any sense think of it as a good thing because my mind knows the consequences. But if I act from my gut--if I am bored, say, or angry--one sniff can lean to decades of misery for me and my loved ones.
BBut, bcause I have spent my life learning to think, I can overcome my emotions in the presence of the drug and recognize that it is not worth
 it, and absent myself from any temptation.

In that case, leaning how to think can save my life. This is true for all decisions, large and small. Behind every decision to enter college, get married, or change professions is a series of decisions about what we value and how best to achieve our goals.

Take cocaine. I may know its bad. I may know it is expensive. And I may know it has been the ruin of many, causing poverty, imprisonment, divorce, addiction, heart problems and death. So if someone offers me a ""toot"" of the ""white lady"" or ""yayo"" I do not in any sense think of it as a good thing because my mind knows the consequences. But if I act from my gut--if I am bored, say, or angry--one sniff can lean to decades of misery for me and my loved ones.

 it, and absent myself from any temptation.
