In my opinion, engaging mindfully with our world is important and it's really hard to do that without keeping up with the news. I think it's necessary to know what is going on in the world because it helps us understand the context of our lives. People should keep up with the news and current events so that they can respond in the way that's necessary for society. It's also important to keep up with the news to that a person can be informed as a voter. With a population more informed, people can vote on the issues in a way that's more beneficial to everyone. 
Another reason I think it's important for folks to keep up with the news is because it's a way to stay connected to people. If you know more about current events, especially in your own community, it's much easier to start a conversation with a stranger. It also helps when another person wants to start a conversation with you, for you to have some idea of topics they may talk about. The world around us, in a way, is the thing that connects us, so this common knowledge is vital, especially in a democratic society.

In my opinion, engaging mindfully with our world is important and it's really hard to do that without keeping up with the news. I think it's necessary to know what is going on in the world because it helps us understand the context of our lives. People should keep up with the news and current events so that they can respond in the way that's necessary for society. It's also important to keep up with the news to that a person can be informed as a voter. With a population more informed, people can vote on the issues in a way that's more beneficial to everyone. 
Another reason I think it's important for folks to keep up with the news is because it's a way to stay connected to people. If you know more about current events, especially in your own community, it's much easier to start a conversation with a stranger.

In my opinion, engaging mindfully with our world is important and it's really hard to do that without keeping up with the news. I think it's necessary to know what is going on in the world because it helps us understand the context of our lives. People should keep up with the news and current events so that they can respond in the way that's necessary for society. It's also important to keep up with the news to that a person can be informed as a voter. With a population more informed, people can vote on the issues in a way that's more beneficial to everyone. 
Another reason I think it's important for folks to keep up with the news is because it's a way to stay connected to people. If you know more about current events, especially in your own community, it's much easier to start a conversation with a stranger. It also helps when another person wants to start a conversation with you, for you to have some idea of topics they may talk about. The world around us, in a way, is the thing that connects us, so this common knowledge is vital, especially in a democratic society.
I also thing that engaging with current events can help communities by addressing the needs of the less fortunate. Only by communicating with one another can people get involved with helping others in their area.

In my opinion, engaging mindfully with our world is important and it's really hard to do that without keeping up with the news. I think it's necessary to know what is going on in the world because it helps us understand the context of our lives. People should keep up with the news and current events so that they can respond in the way that's necessary for society. It's also important to keep up with the news to that a person can be informed as a voter. With a population more informed, people can vote on the issues in a way that's more beneficial to everyone. 
Another reason I think it's important for folks to keep up with the news is because it's a way to stay connected to people.

In my opinion, engaging mindfully with our world is important and it's really hard to do that without keeping up with the news. I think it's necessary to know what is going on in the world because it helps us understand the context of our lives. People should keep up with the news and current events so that they can respond in the way that's necessary for society. It's also important to keep up with the news to that a person can be informed as a voter. With a population more informed, people can vote on the issues in a way that's more beneficial to everyone. 
Another reason I think it's important for folks to keep up with the news is because it's a way to stay connected to people. If you know more about current events, especially in your own community, it's much easier to start a conversation with a stranger. It also helps when another person wants to start a conversation with you, for you to have some idea of topics they may talk about. The world around us, in a way, is the thing that connects us, so this common knowledge is vital, especially in a democratic society.
I also thing that engaging with current events can help communities by addressing the needs of the less fortunate. Only by communicating with one another can people get involved with helping others in their area.

In my opinion, engaging mindfully with our world is important and it's really hard to do that without keeping up with the news. I think it's necessary to know what is going on in the world because it helps us understand the context of our lives. People should keep up with the news and current events so that they can respond in the way that's necessary for society. It's also important to keep up with the news to that a person can be informed as a voter. With a population more informed, people can vote on the issues in a way that's more beneficial to everyone. 
Another reason I think it's important for folks to keep up with the news is because it's a way to stay connected to people.

In my opinion, engaging mindfully with our world is important and it's really hard to do that without keeping up with the news. I think it's necessary to know what is going on in the world because it helps us understand the context of our lives. People should keep up with the news and current events so that they can respond in the way that's necessary for society. It's also important to keep up with the news to that a person can be informed as a voter. With a population more informed, people can vote on the issues in a way that's more beneficial to everyone. 
Another reason I think it's important for folks to keep up with the news is because it's a way to stay connected to people. If you know more about current events, especially in your own community, it's much easier to start a conversation with a stranger. It also helps when another person wants to start a conversation with you, for you to have some idea of topics they may talk about. The world around us, in a way, is the thing that connects us, so this common knowledge is vital, especially in a democratic society.
I also thing that engaging with current events can help communities by addressing the needs of the less fortunate. Only by communicating with one another can people get involved with helping others in their area.

In my opinion, engaging mindfully with our world is important and it's really hard to do that without keeping up with the news. I think it's necessary to know what is going on in the world because it helps us understand the context of our lives. People should keep up with the news and current events so that they can respond in the way that's necessary for society. It's also important to keep up with the news to that a person can be informed as a voter. With a population more informed, people can vote on the issues in a way that's more beneficial to everyone. 
Another reason I think it's important for folks to keep up with the news is because it's a way to stay connected to people.
