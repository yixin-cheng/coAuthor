To do what's best for ourselves, family, and country we have a responsibility and civic duty to stay up to date and informed about current events. 

If we do not fulfill our civic duty as citizens then our opinions and decisions will not be based on facts. if our opinions are not based on facts then this might led to conflict with others, especially when one doesn't have any logical reasons to say why they feel one way or another about a specific topic. If you are unable to explain why you think or feel like you do about a specific topic, how can you expect others to listen to what you have to say or respect your views? The answer is, they won't.

This way, we can then form well-rounded opinions and make informed decisions and be able to communicate and share our views with friends, family, and co-workers.

If you are unable to explain why you think or feel like you do about a specific topic, how can you expect others to listen to what you have to say or respect your views? The answer is, they won't.

here are people who don't think it is their responsibility to keep up with news.
 They want to believe what they want to believe to be true or share the same views with someone that they like regardless of whether or not their views are based on facts or not. We are all guilty of this at some point in our lives. But we need to gather data and information from reliable sources, preferably multiple sources so that we know whether or not something is factual or fake news. This way, we can then form well-rounded opinions and make informed decisions and be able to communicate and share our views with friends, family, and co-workers.
WWith today's technology, w are sverylucky to have the access to all of the current news information wthat e need right at our fingertips.
 We can access current world, national, and local news with our computers, cell phones, and TVs. Everyone can form reasonable and logical stances on current events using these modern forms of technology. If you fail to do your part and stay current with the news then you have failed your civic duty as an American citizen.",2110,[],0,4,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,2692
