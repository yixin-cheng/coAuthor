In my opinion, dating apps are okay to scan for potential compatability. It is nice to choose a few people to meet. It is acceptable to use dating apps because it is not easy to meet someone in real life. Dating apps expand the options one can choose from.

I have not used dating apps, If I were younger and single, I am pretty sure I would try them. My biggest concern is for safety.  People online do not always present themselves accurately. It would be a great way for a criminal to rob or rape someone. I like the idea of being able to check out the person a little bit.  I would probably ask to call them at work and I would definitely google them.

It would be a great way for a criminal to rob or rape someone. I like the idea of being able to check out the person a little bit.  I would probably ask to call them at work and I would definitely google them.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, dating apps are okay to scan for potential compatability. It is nice to choose a few people to meet. It is acceptable to use dating apps because it is not easy to meet someone in real life. Dating apps expand the options one can choose from. 

I have not used dating apps, If I were younger and single, I am pretty sure I would try them. My biggest concern is for safety.  People online do not always present themselves accurately. It would be a great way for a criminal to rob or rape someone. I like the idea of being able to check out the person a little bit.  I would probably ask to call them at work and I would definitely google them.

Technology has both helped and hurt dating. It is easy to isolate in social and entertainment online venues. It is also easy to embellish things about yourself, which is not honest. Relationships have less face to face communication and socialization. I think body language is essentiall to undestanding someone.

In my opinion, dating apps are okay to scan for potential compatability. It is nice to choose a few people to meet. It is acceptable to use dating apps because it is not easy to meet someone in real life. Dating apps expand the options one can choose from. 

I have not used dating apps, If I were younger and single, I am pretty sure I would try them. My biggest concern is for safety.  People online do not always present themselves accurately. It would be a great way for a criminal to rob or rape someone. I like the idea of being able to check out the person a little bit.  I would probably ask to call them at work and I would definitely google them.

Technology has both helped and hurt dating. It is easy to isolate in social and entertainment online venues. It is also easy to embellish things about yourself, which is not honest. Relationships have less face to face communication and socialization. I think body language is essentiall to undestanding someone.

In my opinion, dating apps are okay to scan for potential compatability. It is nice to choose a few people to meet. It is acceptable to use dating apps because it is not easy to meet someone in real life. Dating apps expand the options one can choose from. 

I have not used dating apps, If I were younger and single, I am pretty sure I would try them. My biggest concern is for safety.  People online do not always present themselves accurately. It would be a great way for a criminal to rob or rape someone. I like the idea of being able to check out the person a little bit.  I would probably ask to call them at work and I would definitely google them.

Technology has both helped and hurt dating. It is easy to isolate in social and entertainment online venues. It is also easy to embellish things about yourself, which is not honest. Relationships have less face to face communication and socialization. I think body language is essential to undestanding someone. People in a relationship need to hold each other accountable for real life time together away from technology. I think the conscious effort to do this prevents people from falling down the proverbial rabbit hole, only to find that hours passed that they could be spending with their loved one.
I think technology has made dating easier for people who are shy or have social anxiety.
 The person can communicate with someone a little bit before an actual date. This is a good way to break the ice that can cause anxiety.

In my opinion, dating apps are okay to scan for potential compatability. It is nice to choose a few people to meet. It is acceptable to use dating apps because it is not easy to meet someone in real life. Dating apps expand the options one can choose from. 

I have not used dating apps, If I were younger and single, I am pretty sure I would try them. My biggest concern is for safety.  People online do not always present themselves accurately. It would be a great way for a criminal to rob or rape someone. I like the idea of being able to check out the person a little bit.  I would probably ask to call them at work and I would definitely google them.

Technology has both helped and hurt dating. It is easy to isolate in social and entertainment online venues. It is also easy to embellish things about yourself, which is not honest. Relationships have less face to face communication and socialization. I think body language is essential to undestanding someone. People in a relationship need to hold each other accountable for real life time together away from technology. I think the conscious effort to do this prevents people from falling down the proverbial rabbit hole, only to find that hours passed that they could be spending with their loved one.

In my opinion, dating apps are okay to scan for potential compatability. It is nice to choose a few people to meet. It is acceptable to use dating apps because it is not easy to meet someone in real life. Dating apps expand the options one can choose from. 

I have not used dating apps, If I were younger and single, I am pretty sure I would try them. My biggest concern is for safety.  People online do not always present themselves accurately. It would be a great way for a criminal to rob or rape someone. I like the idea of being able to check out the person a little bit.  I would probably ask to call them at work and I would definitely google them.

Technology has both helped and hurt dating. It is easy to isolate in social and entertainment online venues. It is also easy to embellish things about yourself, which is not honest. Relationships have less face to face communication and socialization. I think body language is essential to undestanding someone. People in a relationship need to hold each other accountable for real life time together away from technology. I think the conscious effort to do this prevents people from falling down the proverbial rabbit hole, only to find that hours passed that they could be spending with their loved one.
I think technology has made dating easier for people who are shy or have social anxiety.
 The person can communicate with someone a little bit before an actual date. This is a good way to break the ice that can cause anxiety.
