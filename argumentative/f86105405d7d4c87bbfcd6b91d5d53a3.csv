Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
But generally, sports are about testing yourself.

And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
But generally, sports are about testing yourself.
 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous.

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.

 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport.

 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.

Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.

Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.

 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
But generally, sports are about testing yourself.
 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.

Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.

 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.

 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.

Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.

 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.

 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs.

For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs.

 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why?

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs.

Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
But generally, sports are about testing yourself.
 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored.

 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
But generally, sports are about testing yourself.
 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored. 

Finally, while extreme sports are risky, like with any activity they will become less risky over time. As more is learned about them, and more safety measures are developed, the dangers will decrease. And it would be sad to lose such exciti",2228,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,2123

But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
But generally, sports are about testing yourself.
 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
But generally, sports are about testing yourself.
 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored. 

Finally, while extreme sports are risky, like with any activity they will become less risky over time. As more is learned about them, and more safety measures are developed, the dangers will decrease. And it would be sad to lose such exciting and enjoyable activities due to fear.

Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored. 

Finally, while extreme sports are risky, like with any activity they will become less risky over time. As more is learned about them, and more safety measures are developed, the dangers will decrease. And it would be sad to lose such exciting and enjoyable activities due to fear.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
But generally, sports are about testing yourself.
 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
But generally, sports are about testing yourself.
 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored. 

Finally, while extreme sports are risky, like with any activity they will become less risky over time. As more is learned about them, and more safety measures are developed, the dangers will decrease. And it would be sad to lose such exciting and enjoyable activities due to fear. 

So I say those who want to participate in extreme sports shoul",2333,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,2238

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
But generally, sports are about testing yourself.
 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored. 

Finally, while extreme sports are risky, like with any activity they will become less risky over time. As more is learned about them, and more safety measures are developed, the dangers will decrease. And it would be sad to lose such exciting and enjoyable activities due to fear.

But generally, sports are about testing yourself.
 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored. 

Finally, while extreme sports are risky, like with any activity they will become less risky over time. As more is learned about them, and more safety measures are developed, the dangers will decrease. And it would be sad to lose such exciting and enjoyable activities due to fear.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
But generally, sports are about testing yourself.
 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored. 

Finally, while extreme sports are risky, like with any activity they will become less risky over time. As more is learned about them, and more safety measures are developed, the dangers will decrease. And it would be sad to lose such exciting and enjoyable activities due to fear. 

So I say those who want to participate in extreme sports should be allowed to do so as most of the risk ",2375,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,2280

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
But generally, sports are about testing yourself.
 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored. 

Finally, while extreme sports are risky, like with any activity they will become less risky over time. As more is learned about them, and more safety measures are developed, the dangers will decrease. And it would be sad to lose such exciting and enjoyable activities due to fear. 

So I say those who want to participate in extreme sports should be allowed to do so as most of the risk is absobed",2385,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,2294

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
But generally, sports are about testing yourself.
 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored. 

Finally, while extreme sports are risky, like with any activity they will become less risky over time. As more is learned about them, and more safety measures are developed, the dangers will decrease. And it would be sad to lose such exciting and enjoyable activities due to fear. 

So I say those who want to participate in extreme sports should be allowed to do so as most of the ris",2373,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,2308

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
But generally, sports are about testing yourself.
 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored. 

Finally, while extreme sports are risky, like with any activity they will become less risky over time. As more is learned about them, and more safety measures are developed, the dangers will decrease. And it would be sad to lose such exciting and enjoyable activities due to fear.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
But generally, sports are about testing yourself.
 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored. 

Finally, while extreme sports are risky, like with any activity they will become less risky over time. As more is learned about them, and more safety measures are developed, the dangers will decrease. And it would be sad to lose such exciting and enjoyable activities due to fear. 

So I say those who want to participate in extreme sports should be allowed to do so ",2355,"[{'index': 0, 'original': ', as long as they are willing to take the risk.', 'trimmed': ', as long as they are willing to take the risk.', 'probability': 4.743535827345239e-17}, {'index': 1, 'original': "", and those who don't should have a choice not to fund it."", 'trimmed': "", and those who don't should have a choice not to fund it."", 'probability': 2.2151179991394484e-27}, {'index': 2, 'original': 'freely, as long as they understand the risks.', 'trimmed': 'freely, as long as they understand the risks.', 'probability': 4.234572234366411e-20}]",0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,2336
