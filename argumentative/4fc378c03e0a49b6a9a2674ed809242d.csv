In my opinion, the most important thing that student should learn in school have nothing to do with the subjects that teachers teach you. Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class. I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain.

In my opinion, the most important thing that student should learn in school have nothing to do with the subjects that teachers teach you. Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class. I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing.

In my opinion, the most important thing that student should learn in school have nothing to do with the subjects that teachers teach you. Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class. I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing.

In my opinion, the most important thing that student should learn in school have nothing to do with the subjects that teachers teach you. Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class. I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing.

What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing. 

These are the important lessons i think students should learn in school.

What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you.

In my opinion, the most important thing that student should learn in school have nothing to do with the subjects that teachers teach you. Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class. I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing. 

These are the important lessons i think students should learn in school. I think they should be ok with not always being the best in that structured of an environment. A

In my opinion, the most important thing that student should learn in school have nothing to do with the subjects that teachers teach you. Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class. I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing.

What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you.

I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain.

In my opinion, the most important thing that student should learn in school have nothing to do with the subjects that teachers teach you. Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class. I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing. 

These are the important lessons i think students should learn in school. I think they should be ok with not always being the best in that structured of an environment. Realizing that they have their whole life to live, and they are unique in their own way.

In my opinion, the most important thing that student should learn in school have nothing to do with the subjects that teachers teach you. Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class. I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends.

In my opinion, the most important thing that student should learn in school have nothing to do with the subjects that teachers teach you. Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class. I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing.

In my opinion, the most important thing that student should learn in school have nothing to do with the subjects that teachers teach you. Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class. I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing. 

These are the important lessons i think students should learn in school. I think they should be ok with not always being the best in that structured of an environment.

What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing. 

These are the important lessons i think students should learn in school. I think they should be ok with not always being the best in that structured of an environment. Realizing that they have their whole life to live, and they are unique in their own way. You just learn so much about yourself when you have to deal with uncomfortable situations, and school

In my opinion, the most important thing that student should learn in school have nothing to do with the subjects that teachers teach you. Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class. I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing.

In my opinion, the most important thing that student should learn in school have nothing to do with the subjects that teachers teach you. Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class. I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing. 

These are the important lessons i think students should learn in school. I think they should be ok with not always being the best in that structured of an environment. Realizing that they have their whole life to live, and they are unique in their own way.

In my opinion, the most important thing that student should learn in school have nothing to do with the subjects that teachers teach you. Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class. I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing. 

These are the important lessons i think students should learn in school. I think they should be ok with not always being the best in that structured of an environment. Realizing that they have their whole life to live, and they are unique in their own way.

In my opinion, the most important thing that student should learn in school have nothing to do with the subjects that teachers teach you. Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class. I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing. 

These are the important lessons i think students should learn in school. I think they should be ok with not always being the best in that structured of an environment.

In my opinion, the most important thing that student should learn in school have nothing to do with the subjects that teachers teach you. Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class. I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing.

In my opinion, the most important thing that student should learn in school have nothing to do with the subjects that teachers teach you. Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class. I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing. 

These are the important lessons i think students should learn in school. I think they should be ok with not always being the best in that structured of an environment. Realizing that they have their whole life to live, and they are unique in their own way. You just learn so much about yourself when you have to deal with uncomfortable situations, and school is the perfect place to make you uncomfortable in certain ways.

In my opinion, the most important thing that student should learn in school have nothing to do with the subjects that teachers teach you. Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class. I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing. 

These are the important lessons i think students should learn in school. I think they should be ok with not always being the best in that structured of an environment. Realizing that they have their whole life to live, and they are unique in their own way. You just learn so much about yourself when you have to deal with uncomfortable situations, and school is the perfect place to make you uncomfortable in certain ways. Since everything is so structured, you are bound to come across situations that are unpleasant. Ov

In my opinion, the most important thing that student should learn in school have nothing to do with the subjects that teachers teach you. Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class.

In my opinion, the most important thing that student should learn in school have nothing to do with the subjects that teachers teach you. Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class. I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing.

Since everything is so structured, you are bound to come across situations that are unpleasant. Overcoming is where you lea

But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing. 

These are the important lessons i think students should learn in school. I think they should be ok with not always being the best in that structured of an environment. Realizing that they have their whole life to live, and they are unique in their own way. You just learn so much about yourself when you have to deal with uncomfortable situations, and school is the perfect place to make you uncomfortable in certain ways. Since everything is so structured, you are bound to come across situations that are unpleasant. Overcoming is where you learn about yours

I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing. 

These are the important lessons i think students should learn in school. I think they should be ok with not always being the best in that structured of an environment. Realizing that they have their whole life to live, and they are unique in their own way. You just learn so much about yourself when you have to deal with uncomfortable situations, and school is the perfect place to make you uncomfortable in certain ways. Since everything is so structured, you are bound to come across situations that are unpleasant. Overcoming is where you learn about yourself.

In my opinion, the most important thing that student should learn in school have nothing to do with the subjects that teachers teach you. Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class. I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain.

In my opinion, the most important thing that student should learn in school have nothing to do with the subjects that teachers teach you. Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class. I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing. 

These are the important lessons i think students should learn in school. I think they should be ok with not always being the best in that structured of an environment.

What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing. 

These are the important lessons i think students should learn in school. I think they should be ok with not always being the best in that structured of an environment. Realizing that they have their whole life to live, and they are unique in their own way. You just learn so much about yourself when you have to deal with uncomfortable situations, and school is the perfect place to make you uncomfortable in certain ways.

So in conclusion, the most important things that students should learn in school is about themselves. They

In my opinion, the most important thing that student should learn in school have nothing to do with the subjects that teachers teach you. Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class. I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing. 

These are the important lessons i think students should learn in school. I think they should be ok with not always being the best in that structured of an environment. Realizing that they have their whole life to live, and they are unique in their own way. You just learn so much about yourself when you have to deal with uncomfortable situations, and school is the perfect place to make you uncomfortable in certain ways. Since everything is so structured, you are bound to come across situations that are unpleasant. Overcoming is where you learn about yourself.
