In my opinion, schools should not be required to provide free pads or tampons. I think that it is a good idea for schools to provide free pads and tampons, but I don’t think that they should be required.

In my opinion, schools should not be required to provide free pads or tampons. I think that it is a good idea for schools to have free pads and tampons on hand, but I don’t think that they should be required to provide them to every student. 

Schools are ultimately a place of learning. They don't have the responsibility to feed or clothe children-this is the parents' duty. Schools could provide period products as a last resort, similar to school lunches for impoverished students.  

Parents are responsible for providing their kid with number 3 pencils,  school clothes, and lunch. They are also responsible for providing their child with pads and tampons. If parents are unable to provide these items, then the child should be able to go to the school nurse and ask for them, but only if their parents have forgotten them.

In my opinion, schools should not be required to provide free pads or tampons. I think that it is a good idea for schools to have free pads and tampons on hand, but I don’t think that they should be required to provide them to every student. 

Schools are ultimately a place of learning. They don't have the responsibility to feed or clothe children-this is the parents' duty. Schools could provide period products as a last resort, similar to school lunches for impoverished students.  

Parents are responsible for providing their kid with number 3 pencils,  school clothes, and lunch. They are also responsible for providing their child with pads and tampons. If parents are unable to provide these items, then the child should be able to go to the school nurse and ask for them, but only if their parents have forgotten them. 

Parents are the providers, schools are the educators. A clean separation of these makes it easier for the student and parents to understand personal responsibilities. Each child is unique, and parents will know their kids best. They provide personalized attire, learning tools, and food, and should teach reproductive responsibility as well.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should not be required to provide free pads or tampons. I think that it is a good idea for schools to have free pads and tampons on hand, but I don’t think that they should be required to provide them to every student. 

Schools are ultimately a place of learning. They don't have the responsibility to feed or clothe children-this is the parents' duty. Schools could provide period products as a last resort, similar to school lunches for impoverished students.  

Parents are responsible for providing their kid with number 3 pencils,  school clothes, and lunch. They are also responsible for providing their child with pads and tampons. If parents are unable to provide these items, then the child should be able to go to the school nurse and ask for them, but only if their parents have forgotten them. 

Parents are the providers, schools are the educators. A clean separation of these makes it easier for the student and parents to understand personal responsibilities. Each child is unique, and parents will know their kids best. They provide personalized attire, learning tools, and food, and should teach reproductive responsibility as well.

Schools are ultimately a place of learning. They don't have the responsibility to feed or clothe children-this is the parents' duty. Schools could provide period products as a last resort, similar to school lunches for impoverished students.  

Parents are responsible for providing their kid with number 3 pencils,  school clothes, and lunch. They are also responsible for providing their child with pads and tampons. If parents are unable to provide these items, then the child should be able to go to the school nurse and ask for them, but only if their parents have forgotten them.

In my opinion, schools should not be required to provide free pads or tampons. I think that it is a good idea for schools to have free pads and tampons on hand, but I don’t think that they should be required to provide them to every student. 

Schools are ultimately a place of learning. They don't have the responsibility to feed or clothe children-this is the parents' duty. Schools could provide period products as a last resort, similar to school lunches for impoverished students.  

Parents are responsible for providing their kid with number 3 pencils,  school clothes, and lunch. They are also responsible for providing their child with pads and tampons. If parents are unable to provide these items, then the child should be able to go to the school nurse and ask for them, but only if their parents have forgotten them.  

Parents are the providers, schools are the educators. A clean separation of these makes it easier for the student and parents to understand personal responsibilities. Each child is unique, and parents will know their kids best. They provide personalized attire, learning tools, and food, and should teach reproductive responsibility as well.

In my opinion, schools should not be required to provide free pads or tampons. I think that it is a good idea for schools to have free pads and tampons on hand, but I don’t think that they should be required to provide them to every student. 

Schools are ultimately a place of learning. They don't have the responsibility to feed or clothe children-this is the parents' duty. Schools could provide period products as a last resort, similar to school lunches for impoverished students.  

Parents are responsible for providing their kid with number 3 pencils,  school clothes, and lunch. They are also responsible for providing their child with pads and tampons. If parents are unable to provide these items, then the child should be able to go to the school nurse and ask for them, but only if their parents have forgotten them.  Period products are cheap- a 100 pack from Walmart costs less than an hour of minumum 

Parents are the providers, schools are the educators. A clean separation of these makes it easier for the student and parents to understand personal responsibilities. Each child is unique, and parents will know their kids best. They provide personalized attire, learning tools, and food, and should teach reproductive responsibility as well.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should not be required to provide free pads or tampons. I think that it is a good idea for schools to have free pads and tampons on hand, but I don’t think that they should be required to provide them to every student. 

Schools are ultimately a place of learning. They don't have the responsibility to feed or clothe children-this is the parents' duty. Schools could provide period products as a last resort, similar to school lunches for impoverished students.  

Parents are responsible for providing their kid with number 3 pencils,  school clothes, and lunch. They are also responsible for providing their child with pads and tampons. If parents are unable to provide these items, then the child should be able to go to the school nurse and ask for them, but only if their parents have forgotten them.  Period products are cheap- a 100 pack from Walmart costs less than an hour of minimum wage pays. 

Parents are the providers, schools are the educators. A clean separation of these makes it easier for the student and parents to understand personal responsibilities. Each child is unique, and parents will know their kids best. They provide personalized attire, learning tools, and food, and should teach reproductive responsibility as well.
