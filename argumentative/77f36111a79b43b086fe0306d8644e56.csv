Other reasons would be because I can listen to them while commuting, working out, walking on the beach, and doing pretty much anything else. I am sure reading has its benefits as well and I still do plenty of that in the forms of email, reports, news and other vital/interesting information but after doing that all day I do not want to go home and cozy up with a nice book and read some more. No, I want to cook dinner and listen to how the universe came into existence or listen to a short sci fi novella from the 1980's.  I can do all this while taking care of my most basic needs.

In my opinion, I think current audio books are much more efficient at teaching and entertaining compared to reading old text books or paperbacks. There are a number of reasons why I think this way. The first reason is simply convenience. You can store thousands of books right onto your phone without taking up much space and they are available anytime in a very organized easy to find way.  Other reasons would be because I can listen to them while commuting, working out, walking on the beach, and doing pretty much anything else. I am sure reading has its benefits as well and I still do plenty of that in the forms of email, reports, news and other vital/interesting information but after doing that all day I do not want to go home and cozy up with a nice book and read some more. No, I want to cook dinner and listen to how the universe came into existence or listen to a short sci fi novella from the 1980's.  I can do all this while taking care of my most basic needs.
