In my opinion, stereotypical characters can be offensive. I'm sometimes offended by people who are very stereotypically gay. One example that comes to mind is the movie ""Birdcage"". The gay men in it are very over the top and very feminine. They run around screaming and acting more like women than anything. It made it hard to watch. It oddly was very highly praised when it came out which shows how people must view gay people.C
Nowadays I'm sometimes offended by how men are stereotyped. I feel that some men are portrayed as being affected by irrational emotions and prone to be abusive. This happened in that Gillete ad about toxic masculinity. I found that to be really offensive that only men can supposedly act horribly. 

I feel that stereotypes are fading somewhat over time. They are not as bad as they used to be. Women used to be portrayed as non-rational, and usually the Damsel in Distress. Now they are very tough in movies and can defend themselves. Gay men are also more shown in a positive light. You're seeing more that are depicted as masculine which I like.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters can be offensive. I'm sometimes offended by people who are very stereotypically gay. One example that comes to mind is the movie ""Birdcage"". The gay men in it are very over the top and very feminine. They run around screaming and acting more like women than anything. It made it hard to watch. It oddly was very highly praised when it came out which shows how people must view gay people.C
Nowadays I'm sometimes offended by how men are stereotyped. I feel that some men are portrayed as being affected by irrational emotions and prone to be abusive. This happened in that Gillete ad about toxic masculinity. I found that to be really offensive that only men can supposedly act horribly. 

I feel that stereotypes are fading somewhat over time. They are not as bad as they used to be. Women used to be portrayed as non-rational, and usually the Damsel in Distress. Now they are very tough in movies and can defend themselves. Gay men are also more shown in a positive light. You're seeing more that are depicted as masculine which I like. 

So there's times stereotypes make me cringe and even angry. I try not to let it bother me. But I'm seeing less of it in general. I just feel that everyone should be shown as a wide rang",1502,[],4,4,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1262

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypical characters can be offensive. I'm sometimes offended by people who are very stereotypically gay. One example that comes to mind is the movie ""Birdcage"". The gay men in it are very over the top and very feminine. They run around screaming and acting more like women than anything. It made it hard to watch. It oddly was very highly praised when it came out which shows how people must view gay people.C
Nowadays I'm sometimes offended by how men are stereotyped. I feel that some men are portrayed as being affected by irrational emotions and prone to be abusive. This happened in that Gillete ad about toxic masculinity. I found that to be really offensive that only men can supposedly act horribly. 

I feel that stereotypes are fading somewhat over time. They are not as bad as they used to be. Women used to be portrayed as non-rational, and usually the Damsel in Distress. Now they are very tough in movies and can defend themselves. Gay men are also more shown in a positive light. You're seeing more that are depicted as masculine which I like. 

So there's times stereotypes make me cringe and even angry. I try not to let it bother me. But I'm seeing less of it in general. I just feel that everyone should be shown as a wide range of people. Every race or group has people who are strong or weak or tough or feminine. There's so much variation. You just don't want to focus on one or a very limited amount.

Nowadays I'm sometimes offended by how men are stereotyped. I feel that some men are portrayed as being affected by irrational emotions and prone to be abusive. This happened in that Gillete ad about toxic masculinity. I found that to be really offensive that only men can supposedly act horribly. 

I feel that stereotypes are fading somewhat over time. They are not as bad as they used to be. Women used to be portrayed as non-rational, and usually the Damsel in Distress. Now they are very tough in movies and can defend themselves. Gay men are also more shown in a positive light. You're seeing more that are depicted as masculine which I like.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters can be offensive. I'm sometimes offended by people who are very stereotypically gay. One example that comes to mind is the movie ""Birdcage"". The gay men in it are very over the top and very feminine. They run around screaming and acting more like women than anything. It made it hard to watch.
