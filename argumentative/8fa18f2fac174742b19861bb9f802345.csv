Captains Hastings is not likeable, in fact borderline sociopathic, but he is real and I found myself caring deeply what happens to him in spite of my personal dislike of him.

In my opinion, what makes a character portrayal offensive is its unreality. And there's an easy test for that: If I am reading or watching a movie and I find that I have not developed empathy for a character, then that character has likely been portrayed in a way that is not fully formed, and hence is unreal.

An example of a ""real"" character is the portrayal of Captain Hastings, played by Adrian Dunbar, in the BBC/Acorn show Line of Duty. Captains Hastings is not likeable, in fact borderline sociopathic, but he is real and I found myself caring deeply what happens to him in spite of my personal dislike of him.
I think that's the key to a good portrayal of a character:
 you may like or hate them, but you care.

A contrary example is the protagonist of the fiction book ""The Good Lawyer"" by Thomas Benigno. The book is masterfully plotted, but the main character is a  cipher. I didn't relate to him and didn't care what happened to him. He could have been anyone. The book suffered and so did the reader.

In my opinion, what makes a character portrayal offensive is its unreality. And there's an easy test for that: If I am reading or watching a movie and I find that I have not developed empathy for a character, then that character has likely been portrayed in a way that is not fully formed, and hence is unreal.

An example of a ""real"" character is the portrayal of Captain Hastings, played by Adrian Dunbar, in the BBC/Acorn show Line of Duty. Captains Hastings is not likeable, in fact borderline sociopathic, but he is real and I found myself caring deeply what happens to him in spite of my personal dislike of him.
I think that's the key to a good portrayal of a character:
 you may like or hate them, but you care.

A contrary example is the protagonist of the fiction book ""The Good Lawyer"" by Thomas Benigno. The book is masterfully plotted, but the main character is a  cipher. I didn't relate to him and didn't care what happened to him. He could have been anyone. The book suffered and so did the reader.
