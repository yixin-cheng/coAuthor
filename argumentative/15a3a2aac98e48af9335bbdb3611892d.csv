Without a basic knowledge of the events that shape political issues both at home and abroad, a citizen will be unable to participate in meaningful ways to vote in matters related to those issues, or even know where they stand on an issue. For instance, if you don't know what a bill is, how are you supposed to make an informed vote on it? If you aren't well informed about the latest developments in climate science, how can you responsibly make a decision when a politician campaigns on claims that that global warming does, or doesn't, exist?

In my opinion, citizens living in democratic country have the responsibility to keep themselves well informed so that they can be well-qualified to participate in their own government (i.e., vote). Without a basic knowledge of the events that shape political issues both at home and abroad, a citizen will be unable to participate in meaningful ways to vote in matters related to those issues, or even know where they stand on an issue. For instance, if you don't know what a bill is, how are you supposed to make an informed vote on it? If you aren't well informed about the latest developments in climate science, how can you responsibly make a decision when a politician campaigns on claims that that global warming does, or doesn't, exist? If you don't know where your country stands on the world stage, how can you intelligently weigh in on the validity of candidates' foreign policy claims?

Without a basic knowledge of the events that shape political issues both at home and abroad, a citizen will be unable to participate in meaningful ways to vote in matters related to those issues, or even know where they stand on an issue. For instance, if you don't know what a bill is, how are you supposed to make an informed vote on it? If you aren't well informed about the latest developments in climate science, how can you responsibly make a decision when a politician campaigns on claims that that global warming does, or doesn't, exist? If you don't know where your country stands on the world stage, how can you intelligently weigh in on the validity of candidates' foreign policy claims?

In addition, living in our modern era, we are often privy to information that can be quite overwhelming, and misleading, and simply consuming what the mainstream media feeds us, is insufficient for a voter to consider themselves well-informed enough to participate in democracy.

In my opinion, citizens living in democratic country have the responsibility to keep themselves well informed so that they can be well-qualified to participate in their own government (i.e., vote). Without a basic knowledge of the events that shape political issues both at home and abroad, a citizen will be unable to participate in meaningful ways to vote in matters related to those issues, or even know where they stand on an issue.

For instance, if you don't know what a bill is, how are you supposed to make an informed vote on it? If you aren't well informed about the latest developments in climate science, how can you responsibly make a decision when a politician campaigns on claims that that global warming does, or doesn't, exist? If you don't know where your country stands on the world stage, how can you intelligently weigh in on the validity of candidates' foreign policy claims?

In addition, living in our modern era, we are often privy to information that can be quite overwhelming, and misleading, and simply consuming what the mainstream media feeds us, is insufficient for a voter to consider themselves well-informed enough to participate in democracy. We have to look at different media outlets, news stories and fact-check them, in order to be well-informed.

In my opinion, citizens living in democratic country have the responsibility to keep themselves well informed so that they can be well-qualified to participate in their own government (i.e., vote). Without a basic knowledge of the events that shape political issues both at home and abroad, a citizen will be unable to participate in meaningful ways to vote in matters related to those issues, or even know where they stand on an issue. For instance, if you don't know what a bill is, how are you supposed to make an informed vote on it? If you aren't well informed about the latest developments in climate science, how can you responsibly make a decision when a politician campaigns on claims that that global warming does, or doesn't, exist? If you don't know where your country stands on the world stage, how can you intelligently weigh in on the validity of candidates' foreign policy claims?

In my opinion, citizens living in democratic country have the responsibility to keep themselves well informed so that they can be well-qualified to participate in their own government (i.e., vote). Without a basic knowledge of the events that shape political issues both at home and abroad, a citizen will be unable to participate in meaningful ways to vote in matters related to those issues, or even know where they stand on an issue. For instance, if you don't know what a bill is, how are you supposed to make an informed vote on it?

In my opinion, citizens living in democratic country have the responsibility to keep themselves well informed so that they can be well-qualified to participate in their own government (i.e., vote). Without a basic knowledge of the events that shape political issues both at home and abroad, a citizen will be unable to participate in meaningful ways to vote in matters related to those issues, or even know where they stand on an issue. For instance, if you don't know what a bill is, how are you supposed to make an informed vote on it? If you aren't well informed about the latest developments in climate science, how can you responsibly make a decision when a politician campaigns on claims that that global warming does, or doesn't, exist? If you don't know where your country stands on the world stage, how can you intelligently weigh in on the validity of candidates' foreign policy claims?

In addition, living in our modern era, we are often privy to information that can be quite overwhelming, and misleading, and simply consuming what the mainstream media feeds us, is insufficient for a voter to consider themselves well-informed enough to participate in democracy.

In my opinion, citizens living in democratic country have the responsibility to keep themselves well informed so that they can be well-qualified to participate in their own government (i.e., vote). Without a basic knowledge of the events that shape political issues both at home and abroad, a citizen will be unable to participate in meaningful ways to vote in matters related to those issues, or even know where they stand on an issue.

In addition, living in our modern era, we are often privy to information that can be quite overwhelming, and misleading, and simply consuming what the mainstream media feeds us, is insufficient for a voter to consider themselves well-informed enough to participate in democracy.

In my opinion, citizens living in democratic country have the responsibility to keep themselves well informed so that they can be well-qualified to participate in their own government (i.e., vote). Without a basic knowledge of the events that shape political issues both at home and abroad, a citizen will be unable to participate in meaningful ways to vote in matters related to those issues, or even know where they stand on an issue. For instance, if you don't know what a bill is, how are you supposed to make an informed vote on it?

In my opinion, citizens living in democratic country have the responsibility to keep themselves well informed so that they can be well-qualified to participate in their own government (i.e., vote). Without a basic knowledge of the events that shape political issues both at home and abroad, a citizen will be unable to participate in meaningful ways to vote in matters related to those issues, or even know where they stand on an issue. For instance, if you don't know what a bill is, how are you supposed to make an informed vote on it? If you aren't well informed about the latest developments in climate science, how can you responsibly make a decision when a politician campaigns on claims that that global warming does, or doesn't, exist? If you don't know where your country stands on the world stage, how can you intelligently weigh in on the validity of candidates' foreign policy claims?

In addition, living in our modern era, we are often privy to information that can be quite overwhelming, and misleading, and simply consuming what the mainstream media feeds us, is insufficient for a voter to consider themselves well-informed enough to participate in democracy. We have to look at different media outlets, news stories and fact-check them, in order to be well-informed. Otherwise, we risk being exposed to a distorted narrative that either intentionally, or inadvertently, creates misinformation and post-factual situations. This, unintentionally, or by design , shuts us out from the process of making informed votes about issues that can seriously affect us or the entire nation, or for that matter the whole world.

In my opinion, citizens living in democratic country have the responsibility to keep themselves well informed so that they can be well-qualified to participate in their own government (i.e., vote). Without a basic knowledge of the events that shape political issues both at home and abroad, a citizen will be unable to participate in meaningful ways to vote in matters related to those issues, or even know where they stand on an issue. For instance, if you don't know what a bill is, how are you supposed to make an informed vote on it? If you aren't well informed about the latest developments in climate science, how can you responsibly make a decision when a politician campaigns on claims that that global warming does, or doesn't, exist? If you don't know where your country stands on the world stage, how can you intelligently weigh in on the validity of candidates' foreign policy claims?

In addition, living in our modern era, we are often privy to information that can be quite overwhelming, and misleading, and simply consuming what the mainstream media feeds us, is insufficient for a voter to consider themselves well-informed enough to participate in democracy. We have to look at different media outlets, news stories and fact-check them, in order to be well-informed.

In my opinion, citizens living in democratic country have the responsibility to keep themselves well informed so that they can be well-qualified to participate in their own government (i.e., vote). Without a basic knowledge of the events that shape political issues both at home and abroad, a citizen will be unable to participate in meaningful ways to vote in matters related to those issues, or even know where they stand on an issue. For instance, if you don't know what a bill is, how are you supposed to make an informed vote on it? If you aren't well informed about the latest developments in climate science, how can you responsibly make a decision when a politician campaigns on claims that that global warming does, or doesn't, exist? If you don't know where your country stands on the world stage, how can you intelligently weigh in on the validity of candidates' foreign policy claims?

In addition, living in our modern era, we are often privy to information that can be quite overwhelming, and misleading, and simply consuming what the mainstream media feeds us, is insufficient for a voter to consider themselves well-informed enough to participate in democracy. We have to look at different media outlets, news stories and fact-check them, in order to be well-informed. Otherwise, we risk being exposed to a distorted narrative that either intentionally, or inadvertently, creates misinformation and post-factual situations. This, unintentionally, or by design , shuts us out from the process of making informed votes about issues that can seriously affect us or the entire nation, or for that matter the whole world.

In my opinion, citizens living in democratic country have the responsibility to keep themselves well informed so that they can be well-qualified to participate in their own government (i.e., vote). Without a basic knowledge of the events that shape political issues both at home and abroad, a citizen will be unable to participate in meaningful ways to vote in matters related to those issues, or even know where they stand on an issue. For instance, if you don't know what a bill is, how are you supposed to make an informed vote on it? If you aren't well informed about the latest developments in climate science, how can you responsibly make a decision when a politician campaigns on claims that that global warming does, or doesn't, exist? If you don't know where your country stands on the world stage, how can you intelligently weigh in on the validity of candidates' foreign policy claims?

In addition, living in our modern era, we are often privy to information that can be quite overwhelming, and misleading, and simply consuming what the mainstream media feeds us, is insufficient for a voter to consider themselves well-informed enough to participate in democracy. We have to look at different media outlets, news stories and fact-check them, in order to be well-informed. Otherwise, we risk being exposed to a distorted narrative that either intentionally, or inadvertently, creates misinformation and post-factual situations. This, unintentionally, or by design , shuts us out from the process of making informed votes about issues that can seriously affect us or the entire nation, or for that matter the whole world.

In my opinion, citizens living in democratic country have the responsibility to keep themselves well informed so that they can be well-qualified to participate in their own government (i.e., vote). Without a basic knowledge of the events that shape political issues both at home and abroad, a citizen will be unable to participate in meaningful ways to vote in matters related to those issues, or even know where they stand on an issue. For instance, if you don't know what a bill is, how are you supposed to make an informed vote on it? If you aren't well informed about the latest developments in climate science, how can you responsibly make a decision when a politician campaigns on claims that that global warming does, or doesn't, exist? If you don't know where your country stands on the world stage, how can you intelligently weigh in on the validity of candidates' foreign policy claims?

In addition, living in our modern era, we are often privy to information that can be quite overwhelming, and misleading, and simply consuming what the mainstream media feeds us, is insufficient for a voter to consider themselves well-informed enough to participate in democracy.

In my opinion, citizens living in democratic country have the responsibility to keep themselves well informed so that they can be well-qualified to participate in their own government (i.e., vote).

In my opinion, citizens living in democratic country have the responsibility to keep themselves well informed so that they can be well-qualified to participate in their own government (i.e., vote). Without a basic knowledge of the events that shape political issues both at home and abroad, a citizen will be unable to participate in meaningful ways to vote in matters related to those issues, or even know where they stand on an issue. For instance, if you don't know what a bill is, how are you supposed to make an informed vote on it? If you aren't well informed about the latest developments in climate science, how can you responsibly make a decision when a politician campaigns on claims that that global warming does, or doesn't, exist?

Without a basic knowledge of the events that shape political issues both at home and abroad, a citizen will be unable to participate in meaningful ways to vote in matters related to those issues, or even know where they stand on an issue. For instance, if you don't know what a bill is, how are you supposed to make an informed vote on it? If you aren't well informed about the latest developments in climate science, how can you responsibly make a decision when a politician campaigns on claims that that global warming does, or doesn't, exist? If you don't know where your country stands on the world stage, how can you intelligently weigh in on the validity of candidates' foreign policy claims?

In addition, living in our modern era, we are often privy to information that can be quite overwhelming, and misleading, and simply consuming what the mainstream media feeds us, is insufficient for a voter to consider themselves well-informed enough to participate in democracy. We have to look at different media outlets, news stories and fact-check them, in order to be well-informed. Otherwise, we risk being exposed to a distorted narrative that either intentionally, or inadvertently, creates misinformation and post-factual situations. This, unintentionally, or by design , shuts us out from the process of making informed votes about issues that can seriously affect us or the entire nation, or for that matter the whole world.

Today, we have the ability to harness all this information, through the internet and social media, and this can give birth to powerful democratic forces that can create real change in politics for the better. It is crucia",2185,[],4,4,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1249

In my opinion, citizens living in democratic country have the responsibility to keep themselves well informed so that they can be well-qualified to participate in their own government (i.e., vote). Without a basic knowledge of the events that shape political issues both at home and abroad, a citizen will be unable to participate in meaningful ways to vote in matters related to those issues, or even know where they stand on an issue. For instance, if you don't know what a bill is, how are you supposed to make an informed vote on it? If you aren't well informed about the latest developments in climate science, how can you responsibly make a decision when a politician campaigns on claims that that global warming does, or doesn't, exist? If you don't know where your country stands on the world stage, how can you intelligently weigh in on the validity of candidates' foreign policy claims?

In addition, living in our modern era, we are often privy to information that can be quite overwhelming, and misleading, and simply consuming what the mainstream media feeds us, is insufficient for a voter to consider themselves well-informed enough to participate in democracy. We have to look at different media outlets, news stories and fact-check them, in order to be well-informed. Otherwise, we risk being exposed to a distorted narrative that either intentionally, or inadvertently, creates misinformation and post-factual situations. This, unintentionally, or by design , shuts us out from the process of making informed votes about issues that can seriously affect us or the entire nation, or for that matter the whole world.

For instance, if you don't know what a bill is, how are you supposed to make an informed vote on it? If you aren't well informed about the latest developments in climate science, how can you responsibly make a decision when a politician campaigns on claims that that global warming does, or doesn't, exist? If you don't know where your country stands on the world stage, how can you intelligently weigh in on the validity of candidates' foreign policy claims?

In addition, living in our modern era, we are often privy to information that can be quite overwhelming, and misleading, and simply consuming what the mainstream media feeds us, is insufficient for a voter to consider themselves well-informed enough to participate in democracy. We have to look at different media outlets, news stories and fact-check them, in order to be well-informed. Otherwise, we risk being exposed to a distorted narrative that either intentionally, or inadvertently, creates misinformation and post-factual situations. This, unintentionally, or by design , shuts us out from the process of making informed votes about issues that can seriously affect us or the entire nation, or for that matter the whole world.

Today, we have the ability to harness all this information, through the internet and social media, and this can give birth to powerful democratic forces that can create real change in politics for the better.

In my opinion, citizens living in democratic country have the responsibility to keep themselves well informed so that they can be well-qualified to participate in their own government (i.e., vote). Without a basic knowledge of the events that shape political issues both at home and abroad, a citizen will be unable to participate in meaningful ways to vote in matters related to those issues, or even know where they stand on an issue. For instance, if you don't know what a bill is, how are you supposed to make an informed vote on it? If you aren't well informed about the latest developments in climate science, how can you responsibly make a decision when a politician campaigns on claims that that global warming does, or doesn't, exist? If you don't know where your country stands on the world stage, how can you intelligently weigh in on the validity of candidates' foreign policy claims?

In addition, living in our modern era, we are often privy to information that can be quite overwhelming, and misleading, and simply consuming what the mainstream media feeds us, is insufficient for a voter to consider themselves well-informed enough to participate in democracy. We have to look at different media outlets, news stories and fact-check them, in order to be well-informed. Otherwise, we risk being exposed to a distorted narrative that either intentionally, or inadvertently, creates misinformation and post-factual situations. This, unintentionally, or by design , shuts us out from the process of making informed votes about issues that can seriously affect us or the entire nation, or for that matter the whole world.

Without a basic knowledge of the events that shape political issues both at home and abroad, a citizen will be unable to participate in meaningful ways to vote in matters related to those issues, or even know where they stand on an issue. For instance, if you don't know what a bill is, how are you supposed to make an informed vote on it? If you aren't well informed about the latest developments in climate science, how can you responsibly make a decision when a politician campaigns on claims that that global warming does, or doesn't, exist? If you don't know where your country stands on the world stage, how can you intelligently weigh in on the validity of candidates' foreign policy claims?

In addition, living in our modern era, we are often privy to information that can be quite overwhelming, and misleading, and simply consuming what the mainstream media feeds us, is insufficient for a voter to consider themselves well-informed enough to participate in democracy. We have to look at different media outlets, news stories and fact-check them, in order to be well-informed. Otherwise, we risk being exposed to a distorted narrative that either intentionally, or inadvertently, creates misinformation and post-factual situations. This, unintentionally, or by design , shuts us out from the process of making informed votes about issues that can seriously affect us or the entire nation, or for that matter the whole world.

Today, we have the ability to harness all this information, through the internet and social media, and this can give birth to powerful democratic forces that can create real change in politics for the better.

We have to look at different media outlets, news stories and fact-check them, in order to be well-informed.

In my opinion, citizens living in democratic country have the responsibility to keep themselves well informed so that they can be well-qualified to participate in their own government (i.e., vote). Without a basic knowledge of the events that shape political issues both at home and abroad, a citizen will be unable to participate in meaningful ways to vote in matters related to those issues, or even know where they stand on an issue.

In my opinion, citizens living in democratic country have the responsibility to keep themselves well informed so that they can be well-qualified to participate in their own government (i.e., vote). Without a basic knowledge of the events that shape political issues both at home and abroad, a citizen will be unable to participate in meaningful ways to vote in matters related to those issues, or even know where they stand on an issue. For instance, if you don't know what a bill is, how are you supposed to make an informed vote on it? If you aren't well informed about the latest developments in climate science, how can you responsibly make a decision when a politician campaigns on claims that that global warming does, or doesn't, exist? If you don't know where your country stands on the world stage, how can you intelligently weigh in on the validity of candidates' foreign policy claims?

In addition, living in our modern era, we are often privy to information that can be quite overwhelming, and misleading, and simply consuming what the mainstream media feeds us, is insufficient for a voter to consider themselves well-informed enough to participate in democracy.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, citizens living in democratic country have the responsibility to keep themselves well informed so that they can be well-qualified to participate in their own government (i.e., vote). Without a basic knowledge of the events that shape political issues both at home and abroad, a citizen will be unable to participate in meaningful ways to vote in matters related to those issues, or even know where they stand on an issue. For instance, if you don't know what a bill is, how are you supposed to make an informed vote on it? If you aren't well informed about the latest developments in climate science, how can you responsibly make a decision when a politician campaigns on claims that that global warming does, or doesn't, exist? If you don't know where your country stands on the world stage, how can you intelligently weigh in on the validity of candidates' foreign policy claims?

In addition, living in our modern era, we are often privy to information that can be quite overwhelming, and misleading, and simply consuming what the mainstream media feeds us, is insufficient for a voter to consider themselves well-informed enough to participate in democracy. We have to look at different media outlets, news stories and fact-check them, in order to be well-informed. Otherwise, we risk being exposed to a distorted narrative that either intentionally, or inadvertently, creates misinformation and post-factual situations. This, unintentionally, or by design , shuts us out from the process of making informed votes about issues that can seriously affect us or the entire nation, or for that matter the whole world.
