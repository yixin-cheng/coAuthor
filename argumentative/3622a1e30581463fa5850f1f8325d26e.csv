I know I am very busy with work and don't have the kind of schedule that lends itself to meeting people in bars and such.

If you don't hit it off right away, no hard feelings, AND you don't have to be all weird with them in person.

I know I am very busy with work and don't have the kind of schedule that lends itself to meeting people in bars and such. Dating apps make it possible for me to meet other people that want to meet people without all the awkward fuss of going to a smelly bar.  also think that technology has made it easier to keep in touch with people and maintain relationships.

This means you can chat through the technology and find out enough about them before risking a miserable mismatched first date. If you don't hit it off right away, no hard feelings, AND you don't have to be all weird with them in person. The last reason I think tech and dating apps are good for dating and relationships is because it's easier to find people who are looking for the same thing you are.

In my opinion, technology actually helps with dating these days. It's a lot easier to meet people and get to know them before you actually meet them. I know I am very busy with work and don't have the kind of schedule that lends itself to meeting people in bars and such. Dating apps make it possible for me to meet other people that want to meet people without all the awkward fuss of going to a smelly bar.  also think that technology has made it easier to keep in touch with people and maintain relationships.
 In some relationships it's sometimes necessary to keep in touch with people via text or social media because they are not in the same city or even country. My partner had to travel for 3 weeks one time and being in contact through technology made it much easier. Another reason I think technology is good for dating is because it's easier to get to know people before you meet them. This means you can chat through the technology and find out enough about them before risking a miserable mismatched first date. If you don't hit it off right away, no hard feelings, AND you don't have to be all weird with them in person.

In my opinion, technology actually helps with dating these days. It's a lot easier to meet people and get to know them before you actually meet them. I know I am very busy with work and don't have the kind of schedule that lends itself to meeting people in bars and such. Dating apps make it possible for me to meet other people that want to meet people without all the awkward fuss of going to a smelly bar.  also think that technology has made it easier to keep in touch with people and maintain relationships.
 In some relationships it's sometimes necessary to keep in touch with people via text or social media because they are not in the same city or even country. My partner had to travel for 3 weeks one time and being in contact through technology made it much easier. Another reason I think technology is good for dating is because it's easier to get to know people before you meet them. This means you can chat through the technology and find out enough about them before risking a miserable mismatched first date. If you don't hit it off right away, no hard feelings, AND you don't have to be all weird with them in person. The last reason I think tech and dating apps are good for dating and relationships is because it's easier to find people who are looking for the same thing you are. I just feel like when meeting people out in public it's really hard to know who is actually looking for something with substance.
