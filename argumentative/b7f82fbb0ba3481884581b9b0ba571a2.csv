In my opinion, yes, paying college athletes would hurt the sport in many ways. first of all, it would be a huge distraction for the players. Meaning that they would focus more on their ability to play the game than they would focus on their college academic courses. Why would you care about how well you did in your economics classes when you are making potentially hundreds of thousands playing a sport. You would lose focus do to the money factor. 
Secondly, it would cause a huge rift between the players and the ir fans potentially. You run the even greater risk of fanatics' going to another campus to do serious harm to other students just so their team can come out ahead. 

Yes I believe it would cause colleges to trade players like they were in some sort of professional sports league. Just to get high profits, instead of focusing on spending money to make their schools better. It would be like an open stock market for college athletes. The potential to start student gambling rings is also even higher than it already is.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

In my opinion, yes, paying college athletes would hurt the sport in many ways. first of all, it would be a huge distraction for the players. Meaning that they would focus more on their ability to play the game than they would focus on their college academic courses. Why would you care about how well you did in your economics classes when you are making potentially hundreds of thousands playing a sport. You would lose focus do to the money factor. 
Secondly, it would cause a huge rift between the players and the ir fans potentially. You run the even greater risk of fanatics' going to another campus to do serious harm to other students just so their team can come out ahead. 

Yes I believe it would cause colleges to trade players like they were in some sort of professional sports league. Just to get high profits, instead of focusing on spending money to make their schools better. It would be like an open stock market for college athletes. The potential to start student gambling rings is also even higher than it already is. I feel that it would put the athletes, who do not have the protection of body guards and professional leagues, in greater danger than they need to be. ",2154,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1205
