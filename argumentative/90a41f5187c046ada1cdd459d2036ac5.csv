In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid with monetary rewards. These athletes receive their scholarship in exchange for their performance on the court, track, or field. The opportunity to play in big games, to impress future employers, and to represent their school is enough compensation for these players. ollege athletes already earn tutors, trainers, and coaching in order to be better players.
 The tutors, trainers, and coaches do not charge for their services; therefore neither should the college players. M opponent argues that the colleges should pay athletes because the colleges generate so much money.
  However, the colleges are already pampering the athletes by providing comfortable locker rooms with plush benches, nice equipment, well-tended fields and extensive libraries. In addition to these pampering amenities, the colleges also arrange for summer camps, which increase the odds of a player turning professional.  The colleges also provide a stipend for the athletes, to compensate for their lack of income during the school year. This is quite generous on the colleges part. As a conclusion, college athletes should not be paid with monetary rewards. ",2152,[],2,2,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,632
