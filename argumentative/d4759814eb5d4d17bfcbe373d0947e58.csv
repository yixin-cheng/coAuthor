My parents encouraged me to work and eanr from an early age. From the age of 12 I had a paper route, got my working papers at 16, and worker summers in the factory where my grandfather worked. I gave about 3/4 to my Mom to help with the expenses. I was never that good at sports, but fail to see the difference between me working in a factory or getting paid to play football. Each is a paying job which a young person is lucky to have.

Paying student athletes to pay sports is about as American as it gets. It is a way to reward the best and brightest for their efforts. It is a way to encourage the best and brightest to stay in school. It is a way to keep the best and brightest from being lured away by professional sports agents or teams. 

Who could possibly object to making it financially worthwhile for a young person to stay in school? Karl Marx?

Getting paid to compete does not ""distort"" economics as McDavis claims, getting paid to compete is the essence of economics. In fact, te only thing that might distort the economics of college sports is the NCAA's rules against paying student athletes.


It is about time that we let market forces determine who plays where in college. If a school wants to pay its players, let it. If a school wants to pay its players more than other schools, let it. If a school wants to pay its players less than other schools, let it. If a school wants to pay its players nothing, let it.

My parents encouraged me to work and earn from an early age. From the age of 12 I had a paper route, got my working papers at 16, and worked summers in the factory where my grandfather worked. I gave about 3/4 to my Mom to help with the expenses. I was never that good at sports, but fail to see the difference between me working in a factory or getting paid to play football. Each is a paying job which a young person is lucky to have.

Paying student athletes to pay sports is about as American as it gets. It is a way to reward the best and brightest for their efforts. It is a way to encourage the best and brightest to stay in school. It is a way to keep the best and brightest from being lured away by professional sports agents or teams.

It is about time that we let market forces determine who plays where in college. If a school wants to pay its players, let it. If a school wants to pay its players more than other schools, let it. If a school wants to pay its players less than other schools, let it. If a school wants to pay its players nothing, let it.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?
