If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far.

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and passedbut get paid to play?",1893,[],2,2,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,715

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing bybut get paid to play?",1898,[],2,2,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,732

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid to play?",1927,[],2,2,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,765

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far.

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that?

If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that?

If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far.

If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers' of the supposed 'educational ins",2371,[],0,2,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1156

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers of the supposed 'educational institution.'

McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers of the supposed 'educational institution.'

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid.

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that?

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers of the supposed 'educational institution.' A follow up question to that, is should colleges that do that still be granted tax-exempt status or non-profit status, especially since such a large percentage of the earnings of those schools goes towards running the athletic programs?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers of the supposed 'educational institution.' A follow up question to that, is should colleges that do that still be granted tax-exempt status or non-profit status, especially since such a large percentage of the earnings of those schools goes towards running the athletic programs?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers of the supposed 'educational institution.' A follow up question to that, is should colleges that do that still be granted tax-exempt status or non-profit status, especially since such a large percentage of the earnings of those schools goes towards running the athletic programs?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers of the supposed 'educational institution.' A follow up question to that, is should colleges that do that still be granted tax-exempt status or non-profit status, especially since such a large percentage of the earnings of those schools goes towards running the athletic programs?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers of the supposed 'educational institution.'

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers of the supposed 'educational institution.' A follow up question to that, is should colleges that do that still be granted tax-exempt status or non-profit status, especially since such a large percentage of the earnings of those schools goes towards running the athletic programs?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers of the supposed 'educational institution.'

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers of the supposed 'educational institution.' A follow up question to that, is should colleges that do that still be granted tax-exempt status or non-profit status, especially since such a large percentage of the earnings of those schools goes towards running the athletic programs?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers of the supposed 'educational institution.' A follow up question to that, is should colleges that do that still be granted tax-exempt status or non-profit status, especially since such a large percentage of the earnings of those schools goes towards running the athletic programs?

Again, my answer to all these questions is a resounding, ""NO."" However, if colleges are going to continue to operate in this way, they should at least maintain the pretense ",2792,[],0,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1451

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers of the supposed 'educational institution.'

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers of the supposed 'educational institution.' A follow up question to that, is should colleges that do that still be granted tax-exempt status or non-profit status, especially since such a large percentage of the earnings of those schools goes towards running the athletic programs?

Again, my answer to all these questions is a resounding, ""NO.""

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers of the supposed 'educational institution.' A follow up question to that, is should colleges that do that still be granted tax-exempt status or non-profit status, especially since such a large percentage of the earnings of those schools goes towards running the athletic programs?

Again, my answer to all these questions is a resounding, ""NO.""

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers of the supposed 'educational institution.' A follow up question to that, is should colleges that do that still be granted tax-exempt status or non-profit status, especially since such a large percentage of the earnings of those schools goes towards running the athletic programs?

Again, my answer to all these questions is a resounding, ""NO.""

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers of the supposed 'educational institution.' A follow up question to that, is should colleges that do that still be granted tax-exempt status or non-profit status, especially since such a large percentage of the earnings of those schools goes towards running the athletic programs?

Again, my answer to all these questions is a resounding, ""NO.""

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers of the supposed 'educational institution.' A follow up question to that, is should colleges that do that still be granted tax-exempt status or non-profit status, especially since such a large percentage of the earnings of those schools goes towards running the athletic programs?

Again, my answer to all these questions is a resounding, ""NO.""

No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers of the supposed 'educational institution.' A follow up question to that, is should colleges that do that still be granted tax-exempt status or non-profit status, especially since such a large percentage of the earnings of those schools goes towards running the athletic programs?

Again, my answer to all these questions is a resounding, ""NO."" However, if colleges are going to continue to operate in this way, they should at least maintain the pretense that they are in fact there to educate the students, not to provide a free source of labor and entertainment for them,  in order for them to still be considered schools at all.

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers of the supposed 'educational institution.' A follow up question to that, is should colleges that do that still be granted tax-exempt status or non-profit status, especially since such a large percentage of the earnings of those schools goes towards running the athletic programs?

Again, my answer to all these questions is a resounding, ""NO."" However, if colleges are going to continue to operate in this way, they should at least maintain the pretense that they are in fact there to educate the students, not to provide a free source of labor and entertainment for them,  in order for them to still be considered schools at all.

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers of the supposed 'educational institution.' A follow up question to that, is should colleges that do that still be granted tax-exempt status or non-profit status, especially since such a large percentage of the earnings of those schools goes towards running the athletic programs?

Again, my answer to all these questions is a resounding, ""NO."" However, if colleges are going to continue to operate in this way, they should at least maintain the pretense that they are in fact there to educate the students, not to provide a free source of labor and entertainment for them,  in order for them to still be considered schools at all.

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers of the supposed 'educational institution.' A follow up question to that, is should colleges that do that still be granted tax-exempt status or non-profit status, especially since such a large percentage of the earnings of those schools goes towards running the athletic programs?

Again, my answer to all these questions is a resounding, ""NO."" However, if colleges are going to continue to operate in this way, they should at least maintain the pretense that they are in fact there to educate the students, not to provide a free source of labor and entertainment for them,  in order for them to still be considered schools at all.

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that?

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers of the supposed 'educational institution.' A follow up question to that, is should colleges that do that still be granted tax-exempt status or non-profit status, especially since such a large percentage of the earnings of those schools goes towards running the athletic programs?

Again, my answer to all these questions is a resounding, ""NO.""
