In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love.

This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes.

It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports. Also, I would predict that if college players were paid, then after a while, there would be a few schools with the really great teams because they can afford",2034,[],3,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,934

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love.

This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports. Also, I would predict that if college players were paid, then after a while, there would be a few schools with the really great teams because they can afford them and the rest would have less great teams.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports. Also, I would predict that if college players were paid, then after a while, there would be a few schools with the really great teams because they can afford them and the rest would have less great teams.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports. Also, I would predict that if college players were paid, then after a while, there would be a few schools with the really great teams because they can afford them and the rest would have less great teams.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it.

College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports. Also, I would predict that if college players were paid, then after a while, there would be a few schools with the really great teams because they can afford them and the rest would have less great teams.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports. Also, I would predict that if college players were paid, then after a while, there would be a few schools with the really great teams because they can afford them and the rest would have less great teams.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports. Also, I would predict that if college players were paid, then after a while, there would be a few schools with the really great teams because they can afford them and the rest would have less great teams.

College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports. Also, I would predict that if college players were paid, then after a while, there would be a few schools with the really great teams because they can afford them and the rest would have less great teams. It could cause a scenario where the good (paid for) teams keep getting better while the schools less able to pay for their teams, would see a continued decline in the abi",2252,[],3,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1204

This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it.

McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports. Also, I would predict that if college players were paid, then after a while, there would be a few schools with the really great teams because they can afford them and the rest would have less great teams. It could cause a scenario where the good (paid for) teams keep getting better while the schools less able to pay for their teams, would see a continued decline in the ability of their sports teams.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports. Also, I would predict that if college players were paid, then after a while, there would be a few schools with the really great teams because they can afford them and the rest would have less great teams. It could cause a scenario where the good (paid for) teams keep getting better while the schools less able to pay for their teams, would see a continued decline in the ability of their sports teams.

If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports. Also, I would predict that if college players were paid, then after a while, there would be a few schools with the really great teams because they can afford them and the rest would have less great teams. It could cause a scenario where the good (paid for) teams keep getting better while the schools less able to pay for their teams, would see a continued decline in the ability of their sports teams.

This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it.

If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports. Also, I would predict that if college players were paid, then after a while, there would be a few schools with the really great teams because they can afford them and the rest would have less great teams. It could cause a scenario where the good (paid for) teams keep getting better while the schools less able to pay for their teams, would see a continued decline in the ability of their sports teams.

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports. Also, I would predict that if college players were paid, then after a while, there would be a few schools with the really great teams because they can afford them and the rest would have less great teams. It could cause a scenario where the good (paid for) teams keep getting better while the schools less able to pay for their teams, would see a continued decline in the ability of their sports teams.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports. Also, I would predict that if college players were paid, then after a while, there would be a few schools with the really great teams because they can afford them and the rest would have less great teams. It could cause a scenario where the good (paid for) teams keep getting better while the schools less able to pay for their teams, would see a continued decline in the ability of their sports teams.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports. Also, I would predict that if college players were paid, then after a while, there would be a few schools with the really great teams because they can afford them and the rest would have less great teams. It could cause a scenario where the good (paid for) teams keep getting better while the schools less able to pay for their teams, would see a continued decline in the ability of their sports teams. 
In conclusion i agree with the authors point that paying college athletes would ruin college sports. It would make it into something else all togethe",2430,[],3,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1386

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation.

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports. Also, I would predict that if college players were paid, then after a while, there would be a few schools with the really great teams because they can afford them and the rest would have less great teams. It could cause a scenario where the good (paid for) teams keep getting better while the schools less able to pay for their teams, would see a continued decline in the ability of their sports teams.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports. Also, I would predict that if college players were paid, then after a while, there would be a few schools with the really great teams because they can afford them and the rest would have less great teams. It could cause a scenario where the good (paid for) teams keep getting better while the schools less able to pay for their teams, would see a continued decline in the ability of their sports teams.

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports. Also, I would predict that if college players were paid, then after a while, there would be a few schools with the really great teams because they can afford them and the rest would have less great teams. It could cause a scenario where the good (paid for) teams keep getting better while the schools less able to pay for their teams, would see a continued decline in the ability of their sports teams. 
In conclusion i agree with the authors point that paying college athletes would ruin college sports. It would make it into something else all together that is good for neither college athletic",2473,[],3,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1467

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports. Also, I would predict that if college players were paid, then after a while, there would be a few schools with the really great teams because they can afford them and the rest would have less great teams. It could cause a scenario where the good (paid for) teams keep getting better while the schools less able to pay for their teams, would see a continued decline in the ability of their sports teams. 
In conclusion i agree with the authors point that paying college athletes would ruin college sports. It would make it into something else all togeth that is good for neither college athletics, nor the schools themselves. ",2429,[],3,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1507

This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports. Also, I would predict that if college players were paid, then after a while, there would be a few schools with the really great teams because they can afford them and the rest would have less great teams. It could cause a scenario where the good (paid for) teams keep getting better while the schools less able to pay for their teams, would see a continued decline in the ability of their sports teams.

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports.

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports. Also, I would predict that if college players were paid, then after a while, there would be a few schools with the really great teams because they can afford them and the rest would have less great teams. It could cause a scenario where the good (paid for) teams keep getting better while the schools less able to pay for their teams, would see a continued decline in the ability of their sports teams. 
In conclusion i agree with the authors point that paying college athletes would ruin college sports. It would make it into something else completely;something that is good for neither college athletics, nor the schools themselves. ",2439,[],3,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1547
