Unfortunately, people's beliefs are moving further and further away from being objective and instead are becoming personal truths.

In my opinion, it is a good thing to keep up with whats going on in the world when living in a democracy but it is your right to tune out if thats what your prefer and does not make you a bad citizen. Unfortunately some people who do keep up with the world are being mislead. These people do more damage then the ones who decide to not keep up with current events. I say do your own research with reputable sources, read articles from different sites that oppose the one your reading and see if their arguments are backed by facts but most people do not do this, they go with what they already believe or want to believe. Unfortunately, people's beliefs are moving further and further away from being objective and instead are becoming personal truths. Science education, critical thinking and objective reasoning are slowly being destroyed in schools and by media.

In my opinion, it is a good thing to keep up with whats going on in the world when living in a democracy but it is your right to tune out if thats what your prefer and does not make you a bad citizen. Unfortunately some people who do keep up with the world are being mislead. These people do more damage then the ones who decide to not keep up with current events.

Science education, critical thinking and objective reasoning are slowly being destroyed in schools and by media.

In my opinion, it is a good thing to keep up with whats going on in the world when living in a democracy but it is your right to tune out if thats what your prefer and does not make you a bad citizen. Unfortunately some people who do keep up with the world are being mislead. These people do more damage then the ones who decide to not keep up with current events. I say do your own research with reputable sources, read articles from different sites that oppose the one your reading and see if their arguments are backed by facts but most people do not do this, they go with what they already believe or want to believe. Unfortunately, people's beliefs are moving further and further away from being objective and instead are becoming personal truths. Science education, critical thinking and objective reasoning are slowly being destroyed in schools and by media.

Unfortunately some people who do keep up with the world are being mislead. These people do more damage then the ones who decide to not keep up with current events. I say do your own research with reputable sources, read articles from different sites that oppose the one your reading and see if their arguments are backed by facts but most people do not do this, they go with what they already believe or want to believe.

In my opinion, it is a good thing to keep up with whats going on in the world when living in a democracy but it is your right to tune out if thats what your prefer and does not make you a bad citizen.

In my opinion, it is a good thing to keep up with whats going on in the world when living in a democracy but it is your right to tune out if thats what your prefer and does not make you a bad citizen. Unfortunately some people who do keep up with the world are being mislead. These people do more damage then the ones who decide to not keep up with current events. I say do your own research with reputable sources, read articles from different sites that oppose the one your reading and see if their arguments are backed by facts but most people do not do this, they go with what they already believe or want to believe. Unfortunately, people's beliefs are moving further and further away from being objective and instead are becoming personal truths. Science education, critical thinking and objective reasoning are slowly being destroyed in schools and by media. And this is what is making the world a worse place, not so much the people who tune out.

In my opinion, it is a good thing to keep up with whats going on in the world when living in a democracy but it is your right to tune out if thats what your prefer and does not make you a bad citizen. Unfortunately some people who do keep up with the world are being mislead. These people do more damage then the ones who decide to not keep up with current events. I say do your own research with reputable sources, read articles from different sites that oppose the one your reading and see if their arguments are backed by facts but most people do not do this, they go with what they already believe or want to believe. Unfortunately, people's beliefs are moving further and further away from being objective and instead are becoming personal truths. Science education, critical thinking and objective reasoning are slowly being destroyed in schools and by media. And this is what is making the world a worse place, not so much the people who tune out. Again, I do not reccomend that you tune out in a democracy because if you do your risk loosing that form of government. Again, it is their right and it does not make them bad citzens.

In my opinion, it is a good thing to keep up with whats going on in the world when living in a democracy but it is your right to tune out if thats what your prefer and does not make you a bad citizen. Unfortunately some people who do keep up with the world are being mislead. These people do more damage then the ones who decide to not keep up with current events. I say do your own research with reputable sources, read articles from different sites that oppose the one your reading and see if their arguments are backed by facts but most people do not do this, they go with what they already believe or want to believe. Unfortunately, people's beliefs are moving further and further away from being objective and instead are becoming personal truths. Science education, critical thinking and objective reasoning are slowly being destroyed in schools and by media.

In my opinion, it is a good thing to keep up with whats going on in the world when living in a democracy but it is your right to tune out if thats what your prefer and does not make you a bad citizen. Unfortunately some people who do keep up with the world are being mislead. These people do more damage then the ones who decide to not keep up with current events. I say do your own research with reputable sources, read articles from different sites that oppose the one your reading and see if their arguments are backed by facts but most people do not do this, they go with what they already believe or want to believe. Unfortunately, people's beliefs are moving further and further away from being objective and instead are becoming personal truths. Science education, critical thinking and objective reasoning are slowly being destroyed in schools and by media. And this is what is making the world a worse place, not so much the people who tune out.

In my opinion, it is a good thing to keep up with whats going on in the world when living in a democracy but it is your right to tune out if thats what your prefer and does not make you a bad citizen.

I say do your own research with reputable sources, read articles from different sites that oppose the one your reading and see if their arguments are backed by facts but most people do not do this, they go with what they already believe or want to believe.

In my opinion, it is a good thing to keep up with whats going on in the world when living in a democracy but it is your right to tune out if thats what your prefer and does not make you a bad citizen. Unfortunately some people who do keep up with the world are being mislead. These people do more damage then the ones who decide to not keep up with current events. I say do your own research with reputable sources, read articles from different sites that oppose the one your reading and see if their arguments are backed by facts but most people do not do this, they go with what they already believe or want to believe. Unfortunately, people's beliefs are moving further and further away from being objective and instead are becoming personal truths. Science education, critical thinking and objective reasoning are slowly being destroyed in schools and by media. And this is what is making the world a worse place, not so much the people who tune out. Again, I do not reccomend that you tune out in a democracy because if you do your risk loosing that form of government. Again, it is their right and it does not make them bad citzens.

In my opinion, it is a good thing to keep up with whats going on in the world when living in a democracy but it is your right to tune out if thats what your prefer and does not make you a bad citizen. Unfortunately some people who do keep up with the world are being mislead. These people do more damage then the ones who decide to not keep up with current events. I say do your own research with reputable sources, read articles from different sites that oppose the one your reading and see if their arguments are backed by facts but most people do not do this, they go with what they already believe or want to believe. Unfortunately, people's beliefs are moving further and further away from being objective and instead are becoming personal truths. Science education, critical thinking and objective reasoning are slowly being destroyed in schools and by media. And this is what is making the world a worse place, not so much the people who tune out. Again, I do not reccomend that you tune out in a democracy because if you do your risk loosing that form of government. Again, it is their right and it does not make them bad citzens.

In my opinion, it is a good thing to keep up with whats going on in the world when living in a democracy but it is your right to tune out if thats what your prefer and does not make you a bad citizen. Unfortunately some people who do keep up with the world are being mislead. These people do more damage then the ones who decide to not keep up with current events. I say do your own research with reputable sources, read articles from different sites that oppose the one your reading and see if their arguments are backed by facts but most people do not do this, they go with what they already believe or want to believe. Unfortunately, people's beliefs are moving further and further away from being objective and instead are becoming personal truths. Science education, critical thinking and objective reasoning are slowly being destroyed in schools and by media. And this is what is making the world a worse place, not so much the people who tune out. Again, I do not reccomend that you tune out in a democracy because if you do your risk loosing that form of government. Again, it is their right and it does not make them bad citzens. It is the people who use bad/false information to influence people and pursue their own agendas that are bad citizens.

In my opinion, it is a good thing to keep up with whats going on in the world when living in a democracy but it is your right to tune out if thats what your prefer and does not make you a bad citizen. Unfortunately some people who do keep up with the world are being mislead. These people do more damage then the ones who decide to not keep up with current events. I say do your own research with reputable sources, read articles from different sites that oppose the one your reading and see if their arguments are backed by facts but most people do not do this, they go with what they already believe or want to believe. Unfortunately, people's beliefs are moving further and further away from being objective and instead are becoming personal truths. Science education, critical thinking and objective reasoning are slowly being destroyed in schools and by media. And this is what is making the world a worse place, not so much the people who tune out. Again, I do not reccomend that you tune out in a democracy because if you do your risk loosing that form of government. Again, it is their right and it does not make them bad citzens. It is the people who use bad/false information to influence people and pursue their own agendas that are bad citizens.

In my opinion, it is a good thing to keep up with whats going on in the world when living in a democracy but it is your right to tune out if thats what your prefer and does not make you a bad citizen. Unfortunately some people who do keep up with the world are being mislead. These people do more damage then the ones who decide to not keep up with current events. I say do your own research with reputable sources, read articles from different sites that oppose the one your reading and see if their arguments are backed by facts but most people do not do this, they go with what they already believe or want to believe. Unfortunately, people's beliefs are moving further and further away from being objective and instead are becoming personal truths. Science education, critical thinking and objective reasoning are slowly being destroyed in schools and by media. And this is what is making the world a worse place, not so much the people who tune out.

In my opinion, it is a good thing to keep up with whats going on in the world when living in a democracy but it is your right to tune out if thats what your prefer and does not make you a bad citizen. Unfortunately some people who do keep up with the world are being mislead. These people do more damage then the ones who decide to not keep up with current events. I say do your own research with reputable sources, read articles from different sites that oppose the one your reading and see if their arguments are backed by facts but most people do not do this, they go with what they already believe or want to believe. Unfortunately, people's beliefs are moving further and further away from being objective and instead are becoming personal truths. Science education, critical thinking and objective reasoning are slowly being destroyed in schools and by media. And this is what is making the world a worse place, not so much the people who tune out.

In my opinion, it is a good thing to keep up with whats going on in the world when living in a democracy but it is your right to tune out if thats what your prefer and does not make you a bad citizen.

In my opinion, it is a good thing to keep up with whats going on in the world when living in a democracy but it is your right to tune out if thats what your prefer and does not make you a bad citizen. Unfortunately some people who do keep up with the world are being mislead. These people do more damage then the ones who decide to not keep up with current events. I say do your own research with reputable sources, read articles from different sites that oppose the one your reading and see if their arguments are backed by facts but most people do not do this, they go with what they already believe or want to believe. Unfortunately, people's beliefs are moving further and further away from being objective and instead are becoming personal truths. Science education, critical thinking and objective reasoning are slowly being destroyed in schools and by media. And this is what is making the world a worse place, not so much the people who tune out. Again, I do not reccomend that you tune out in a democracy because if you do your risk loosing that form of government. Again, it is their right and it does not make them bad citzens. It is the people who use bad/false information to influence people and pursue their own agendas that are bad citizens. Unfortunately media has been doing this more and more which also makes it harder for the average person to weed through all the nonesense and it can be discouraging.

In my opinion, it is a good thing to keep up with whats going on in the world when living in a democracy but it is your right to tune out if thats what your prefer and does not make you a bad citizen. Unfortunately some people who do keep up with the world are being mislead. These people do more damage then the ones who decide to not keep up with current events. I say do your own research with reputable sources, read articles from different sites that oppose the one your reading and see if their arguments are backed by facts but most people do not do this, they go with what they already believe or want to believe. Unfortunately, people's beliefs are moving further and further away from being objective and instead are becoming personal truths. Science education, critical thinking and objective reasoning are slowly being destroyed in schools and by media. And this is what is making the world a worse place, not so much the people who tune out. Again, I do not reccomend that you tune out in a democracy because if you do your risk loosing that form of government. Again, it is their right and it does not make them bad citzens. It is the people who use bad/false information to influence people and pursue their own agendas that are bad citizens.

In my opinion, it is a good thing to keep up with whats going on in the world when living in a democracy but it is your right to tune out if thats what your prefer and does not make you a bad citizen. Unfortunately some people who do keep up with the world are being mislead. These people do more damage then the ones who decide to not keep up with current events. I say do your own research with reputable sources, read articles from different sites that oppose the one your reading and see if their arguments are backed by facts but most people do not do this, they go with what they already believe or want to believe. Unfortunately, people's beliefs are moving further and further away from being objective and instead are becoming personal truths. Science education, critical thinking and objective reasoning are slowly being destroyed in schools and by media. And this is what is making the world a worse place, not so much the people who tune out. Again, I do not reccomend that you tune out in a democracy because if you do your risk loosing that form of government. Again, it is their right and it does not make them bad citzens.

In my opinion, it is a good thing to keep up with whats going on in the world when living in a democracy but it is your right to tune out if thats what your prefer and does not make you a bad citizen. Unfortunately some people who do keep up with the world are being mislead. These people do more damage then the ones who decide to not keep up with current events. I say do your own research with reputable sources, read articles from different sites that oppose the one your reading and see if their arguments are backed by facts but most people do not do this, they go with what they already believe or want to believe. Unfortunately, people's beliefs are moving further and further away from being objective and instead are becoming personal truths. Science education, critical thinking and objective reasoning are slowly being destroyed in schools and by media. And this is what is making the world a worse place, not so much the people who tune out. Again, I do not reccomend that you tune out in a democracy because if you do your risk loosing that form of government. Again, it is their right and it does not make them bad citzens.

Unfortunately some people who do keep up with the world are being mislead. These people do more damage then the ones who decide to not keep up with current events. I say do your own research with reputable sources, read articles from different sites that oppose the one your reading and see if their arguments are backed by facts but most people do not do this, they go with what they already believe or want to believe. Unfortunately, people's beliefs are moving further and further away from being objective and instead are becoming personal truths. Science education, critical thinking and objective reasoning are slowly being destroyed in schools and by media. And this is what is making the world a worse place, not so much the people who tune out. Again, I do not reccomend that you tune out in a democracy because if you do your risk loosing that form of government. Again, it is their right and it does not make them bad citzens. It is the people who use bad/false information to influence people and pursue their own agendas that are bad citizens.

In my opinion, it is a good thing to keep up with whats going on in the world when living in a democracy but it is your right to tune out if thats what your prefer and does not make you a bad citizen.

In my opinion, it is a good thing to keep up with whats going on in the world when living in a democracy but it is your right to tune out if thats what your prefer and does not make you a bad citizen.

Again, I do not recommend that you tune out in a democracy because if you do your risk loosing that form of government. Again, it is their right and it does not make them bad citzens. It is the people who use bad/false information to influence people and pursue their own agendas that are bad citizens. Unfortunately media has been doing this more and more which also makes it harder for the average person to weed through all the nonsense and it can be discouraging. We need to get our facts straight and start agreeing on some fundamental, objective truths and work from there. Then maybe more people would be willing to keep up if there was more truth in the media instead of opinion.",1310,[],1,1,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1770
