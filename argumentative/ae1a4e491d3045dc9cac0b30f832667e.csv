In my opinion, we should worry about excessive screen time. We have a whole generation growing up without knowing who their real friends are, or what a real relationship feels like to be friends with somebody. It’s so much easier to be mean to somebody on the other side of a screen, and then you can just “unfriend"" them. 


ocial interaction is being lost, because people are spending more time just being on their screens and watching videos.
 Kids are growing up without learning that they can share their feelings directly with a person. It’s all about, “I’ll send you a message, and we’ll use texting and chatrooms instead."" It’s being at a distance, instead of being able to sit in the same room and talk to somebody. t’s a whole different way of socializing.



We’re all living in our own little bubbles, instead of being out in the real world—seeing who we’re really friends with. Social interaction is becoming very one-sided, with technology becoming people’s best and only friends. We’re in the middle of what I worry is becoming societal isolation. 
My mom went into a meeting with a school teacher who told her the kids aren’t playing in the playground anymore.
 They have these iPads, and they’re at their own little table by themselves. There’s no crossing over and talking to each other, or hearing a different accent than their own. They don’t hear stories; they don’t hear the sounds and smells. They’re growing up missing all those things. 

I worry that the hearing and speech development of young children is being damaged, because they’re not using their mouths or their ears to hear and understand the different sounds of real-life speech.   Many of them can’t sit still, because they are driven by a need to have their mind stimulated.

In my opinion, we should worry about excessive screen time. We have a whole generation growing up without knowing who their real friends are, or what a real relationship feels like to be friends with somebody. It’s so much easier to be mean to somebody on the other side of a screen, and then you can just “unfriend"" them. 


ocial interaction is being lost, because people are spending more time just being on their screens and watching videos.
 Kids are growing up without learning that they can share their feelings directly with a person. It’s all about, “I’ll send you a message, and we’ll use texting and chatrooms instead."" It’s being at a distance, instead of being able to sit in the same room and talk to somebody. t’s a whole different way of socializing.



We’re all living in our own little bubbles, instead of being out in the real world—seeing who we’re really friends with. Social interaction is becoming very one-sided, with technology becoming people’s best and only friends. We’re in the middle of what I worry is becoming societal isolation.

 They have these iPads, and they’re at their own little table by themselves. There’s no crossing over and talking to each other, or hearing a different accent than their own. They don’t hear stories; they don’t hear the sounds and smells. They’re growing up missing all those things. 

I worry that the hearing and speech development of young children is being damaged, because they’re not using their mouths or their ears to hear and understand the different sounds of real-life speech.   Many of them can’t sit still, because they are driven by a need to have their mind stimulated.

In my opinion, we should worry about excessive screen time.

I worry that the hearing and speech development of young children is being damaged, because they’re not using their mouths or their ears to hear and understand the different sounds of real-life speech.   Many of them can’t sit still, because they are driven by a need to have their mind stimulated.

I worry that the hearing and speech development of young children is being damaged, because they’re not using their mouths or their ears to hear and understand the different sounds of real-life speech.   Many of them can’t sit still, because they are driven by a need to have their mind stimulated. Children are growing up at a faster pace than any generation before, and we’re not learning how to deal with real humans. 
I’m scared that we’re growing up to be a generation without human interaction, without seeing human faces.
 We might not learn empathy, and how to handle human emotions. The real world is becoming a screen world. It seems to me that we’re in danger of losing our humanity.

In my opinion, we should worry about excessive screen time. We have a whole generation growing up without knowing who their real friends are, or what a real relationship feels like to be friends with somebody. It’s so much easier to be mean to somebody on the other side of a screen, and then you can just “unfriend"" them. 


ocial interaction is being lost, because people are spending more time just being on their screens and watching videos.
 Kids are growing up without learning that they can share their feelings directly with a person. It’s all about, “I’ll send you a message, and we’ll use texting and chatrooms instead."" It’s being at a distance, instead of being able to sit in the same room and talk to somebody. t’s a whole different way of socializing.



We’re all living in our own little bubbles, instead of being out in the real world—seeing who we’re really friends with. Social interaction is becoming very one-sided, with technology becoming people’s best and only friends. We’re in the middle of what I worry is becoming societal isolation.

In my opinion, we should worry about excessive screen time.

 Kids are growing up without learning that they can share their feelings directly with a person. It’s all about, “I’ll send you a message, and we’ll use texting and chatrooms instead."" It’s being at a distance, instead of being able to sit in the same room and talk to somebody. t’s a whole different way of socializing.

In my opinion, we should worry about excessive screen time. We have a whole generation growing up without knowing who their real friends are, or what a real relationship feels like to be friends with somebody. It’s so much easier to be mean to somebody on the other side of a screen, and then you can just “unfriend"" them.

 Kids are growing up without learning that they can share their feelings directly with a person. It’s all about, “I’ll send you a message, and we’ll use texting and chatrooms instead."" It’s being at a distance, instead of being able to sit in the same room and talk to somebody. t’s a whole different way of socializing.



We’re all living in our own little bubbles, instead of being out in the real world—seeing who we’re really friends with. Social interaction is becoming very one-sided, with technology becoming people’s best and only friends. We’re in the middle of what I worry is becoming societal isolation.

In my opinion, we should worry about excessive screen time. We have a whole generation growing up without knowing who their real friends are, or what a real relationship feels like to be friends with somebody. It’s so much easier to be mean to somebody on the other side of a screen, and then you can just “unfriend"" them. 


ocial interaction is being lost, because people are spending more time just being on their screens and watching videos.
 Kids are growing up without learning that they can share their feelings directly with a person. It’s all about, “I’ll send you a message, and we’ll use texting and chatrooms instead."" It’s being at a distance, instead of being able to sit in the same room and talk to somebody. t’s a whole different way of socializing.



We’re all living in our own little bubbles, instead of being out in the real world—seeing who we’re really friends with. Social interaction is becoming very one-sided, with technology becoming people’s best and only friends. We’re all so busy trying to tweet the best hashtag, or say something that will get a click of a “Like,"" that we’re not taking the time to acknowledge the human being right in front of us.We’re in the middle of what I worry is becoming societal isolation.

 They have these iPads, and they’re at their own little table by themselves. There’s no crossing over and talking to each other, or hearing a different accent than their own. They don’t hear stories; they don’t hear the sounds and smells. They’re growing up missing all those things. 

I worry that the hearing and speech development of young children is being damaged, because they’re not using their mouths or their ears to hear and understand the different sounds of real-life speech.   Many of them can’t sit still, because they are driven by a need to have their mind stimulated. Children are growing up at a faster pace than any generation before, and we’re not learning how to deal with real humans. 
I’m scared that we’re growing up to be a generation without human interaction, without seeing human faces.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should worry about excessive screen time. We have a whole generation growing up without knowing who their real friends are, or what a real relationship feels like to be friends with somebody. It’s so much easier to be mean to somebody on the other side of a screen, and then you can just “unfriend"" them. 


ocial interaction is being lost, because people are spending more time just being on their screens and watching videos.
 Kids are growing up without learning that they can share their feelings directly with a person. It’s all about, “I’ll send you a message, and we’ll use texting and chatrooms instead."" It’s being at a distance, instead of being able to sit in the same room and talk to somebody. t’s a whole different way of socializing.



We’re all living in our own little bubbles, instead of being out in the real world—seeing who we’re really friends with. Social interaction is becoming very one-sided, with technology becoming people’s best and only friends. We’re all so busy trying to tweet the best hashtag, or say something that will get a click of a “Like,"" that we’re not taking the time to acknowledge the human being right in front of us. We’re in the middle of what I worry is becoming a perman societal isolation. 
My mom went into a meeting with a school teacher who told her the kids aren’t playing in the playground anymore.
 They have these iPads, and they’re at their own little table by themselves. There’s no crossing over and talking to each other, or hearing a different accent than their own. They don’t hear stories; they don’t hear the sounds and smells. They’re growing up missing all those things. 

I worry that the hearing and speech development of young children is being damaged, because they’re not using their mouths or their ears to hear and understand the different sounds of real-life speech.   Many of them can’t sit still, because they are driven by a need to have their mind stimulated. Children are growing up at a faster pace than any generation before, and we’re not learning how to deal with real humans. 
I’m scared that we’re growing up to be a generation without human interaction, without seeing human faces.
 We might not learn empathy, and how to handle human emotions. The real world is becoming a screen world. It seems to me that we’re in danger of losing our humanity.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should worry about excessive screen time. We have a whole generation growing up without knowing who their real friends are, or what a real relationship feels like to be friends with somebody. It’s so much easier to be mean to somebody on the other side of a screen, and then you can just “unfriend"" them. 


ocial interaction is being lost, because people are spending more time just being on their screens and watching videos.
 Kids are growing up without learning that they can share their feelings directly with a person. It’s all about, “I’ll send you a message, and we’ll use texting and chatrooms instead."" It’s being at a distance, instead of being able to sit in the same room and talk to somebody. t’s a whole different way of socializing.



We’re all living in our own little bubbles, instead of being out in the real world—seeing who we’re really friends with. Social interaction is becoming very one-sided, with technology becoming people’s best and only friends. We’re all so busy trying to tweet the best hashtag, or say something that will get a click of a “Like,"" that we’re not taking the time to acknowledge the human being right in front of us. We’re in the middle of what I worry is becoming a permanent societal isolation. 
My mom went into a meeting with a school teacher who told her the kids aren’t playing in the playground anymore.
 They have these iPads, and they’re at their own little table by themselves. There’s no crossing over and talking to each other, or hearing a different voice than their own. They don’t hear stories; they don’t hear the sounds and smells. They’re growing up missing all those things. 

I worry that the hearing and speech development of young children is being damaged, because they’re not using their mouths or their ears to hear and understand the different sounds of real-life speech.   Many of them can’t sit still, because they are driven by a need to have their mind stimulated. Children are growing up at a faster pace than any generation before, and we’re not learning how to deal with real humans. 
I’m scared that we’re growing up to be a generation without human interaction, without seeing human faces.
 We might not learn empathy, and how to handle human emotions. The real world is becoming a screen world. It seems to me that we’re in danger of losing our humanity.

We have a whole generation growing up without knowing who their real friends are, or what a real relationship feels like to be friends with somebody. It’s so much easier to be mean to somebody on the other side of a screen, and then you can just “unfriend"" them. 


ocial interaction is being lost, because people are spending more time just being on their screens and watching videos.
 Kids are growing up without learning that they can share their feelings directly with a person. It’s all about, “I’ll send you a message, and we’ll use texting and chatrooms instead."" It’s being at a distance, instead of being able to sit in the same room and talk to somebody. t’s a whole different way of socializing.



We’re all living in our own little bubbles, instead of being out in the real world—seeing who we’re really friends with. Social interaction is becoming very one-sided, with technology becoming people’s best and only friends. We’re all so busy trying to tweet the best hashtag, or say something that will get a click of a “Like,"" that we’re not taking the time to acknowledge the human being right in front of us. We’re in the middle of what I worry is becoming a permanent societal isolation. 
My mom went into a meeting with a school teacher who told her the kids aren’t playing in the playground anymore.
 They have these iPads, and they’re at their own little table by themselves. There’s no crossing over and talking to each other, or hearing a different voice than their own. They don’t hear stories; they don’t hear the sounds and smells. They’re growing up missing all those things. 

I worry that the hearing and speech development of young children is being damaged, because they’re not using their mouths or their ears to hear and understand the different sounds of real-life speech.   Many of them can’t sit still, because they are driven by a need to have their mind stimulated. Children are growing up at a faster pace than any generation before, and th’re not learning how to deal with real humans. 
I’m scared that we’re growing up to be a generation without human interaction, without seeing human faces.
 We might not learn empathy, and how to handle human emotions. The real world is becoming a screen world. It seems to me that we’re in danger of losing our humanity.

In my opinion, we should worry about excessive screen time.
