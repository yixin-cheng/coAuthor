In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethica issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. When you put everything aside, it's just not fair. ",1735,[],1,1,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1269

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place.

This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place.

This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place. 

If colleges are allowed to pay athletes, it will just lead to countless issues down the line. There's many that we can't even imagine that will arise in the future. The best thing is to just say no and never open that doorway. ",2187,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1633

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place. 

If colleges are allowed to pay athletes, it will just lead to countless issues down the line. There's many that we can't even imagine that will arise in the future. The best thing is to just say no and never open that doorway. Once you do, ",2200,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1648

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place. 

If colleges are allowed to pay athletes, it will just lead to countless issues down the line. There's many that we can't even imagine that will arise in the future.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place. 

If colleges are allowed to pay athletes, it will just lead to countless issues down the line. There's many that we can't even imagine that will arise in the future. The best thing is to just say no and never open that doorway. Once you do, you never know what will happen. The one thing we do know though is that",2272,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1720

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place. 

If colleges are allowed to pay athletes, it will just lead to countless issues down the line. There's many that we can't even imagine that will arise in the future. The best thing is to just say no and never open that doorway. Once you do, you never know what will happen. The one thing we do know though is that it isn't fair",2286,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1734

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place. 

If colleges are allowed to pay athletes, it will just lead to countless issues down the line. There's many that we can't even imagine that will arise in the future. The best thing is to just say no and never open that doorway. Once you do, you never know what will happen.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place. 

If colleges are allowed to pay athletes, it will just lead to countless issues down the line. There's many that we can't even imagine that will arise in the future. The best thing is to just say no and never open that doorway. Once you do, you never know what will happen.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place. 

If colleges are allowed to pay athletes, it will just lead to countless issues down the line. There's many that we can't even imagine that will arise in the future. The best thing is to just say no and never open that doorway. Once you do, you never know what will happen.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place. 

If colleges are allowed to pay athletes, it will just lead to countless issues down the line. There's many that we can't even imagine that will arise in the future.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school.

Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place. 

If colleges are allowed to pay athletes, it will just lead to countless issues down the line. There's many that we can't even imagine that will arise in the future.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place. 

If colleges are allowed to pay athletes, it will just lead to countless issues down the line. There's many that we can't even imagine that will arise in the future.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place.

That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place.

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place. 

If colleges are allowed to pay athletes, it will just lead to countless issues down the line. There's many that we can't even imagine that will arise in the future. The best thing is to just say no and never open that doorway. Once you do, you never know what will happen. The one thing we do know though is that it isn't fair to students who are not athletes.

This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place. 

If colleges are allowed to pay athletes, it will just lead to countless issues down the line. There's many that we can't even imagine that will arise in the future. The best thing is to just say no and never open that doorway. Once you do, you never know what will happen. The one thing we do know though is that it isn't fair to students who are not athletes.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place.
