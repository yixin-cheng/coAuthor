In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum.

With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity.

This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am. Music and other arts have been stripped out of the curriculum of a lot of schools, leaving mainly creative writing as the only state sanctioned outlet for creativity. Creative pursuits should never be removed from the course catalog, because that is one of the foundations of learning how to learn.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am. Music and other arts have been stripped out of the curriculum of a lot of schools, leaving mainly creative writing as the only state sanctioned outlet for creativity. Creative pursuits should never be removed from the course catalog, because that is one of the foundations of learning how to learn.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am. Music and other arts have been stripped out of the curriculum of a lot of schools, leaving mainly creative writing as the only state sanctioned outlet for creativity. Creative pursuits should never be removed from the course catalog, because that is one of the foundations of learning how to learn.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am. Music and other arts have been stripped out of the curriculum of a lot of schools, leaving mainly creative writing as the only state sanctioned outlet for creativity. Creative pursuits should never be removed from the course catalog, because that is one of the foundations of learning how to learn. 
As I got older, I learned the power of being able to freely think through problems and challenges that I encounter.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am. Music and other arts have been stripped out of the curriculum of a lot of schools, leaving mainly creative writing as the only state sanctioned outlet for creativity. Creative pursuits should never be removed from the course catalog, because that is one of the foundations of learning how to learn.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am. Music and other arts have been stripped out of the curriculum of a lot of schools, leaving mainly creative writing as the only state sanctioned outlet for creativity.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity.

That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am. Music and other arts have been stripped out of the curriculum of a lot of schools, leaving mainly creative writing as the only state sanctioned outlet for creativity. Creative pursuits should never be removed from the course catalog, because that is one of the foundations of learning how to learn. 
As I got older, I learned the power of being able to freely think through problems and challenges that I encounter.
 Today, I use critical thinking skills that I learned in college to help me traverse the massive amounts of information, and dis-information, that is available to me. With all that information sinking in, I need somewhere to put it. Music gives me that outlet, along with creative writing and some other, occasional, artistic puruits.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am. Music and other arts have been stripped out of the curriculum of a lot of schools, leaving mainly creative writing as the only state sanctioned outlet for creativity. Creative pursuits should never be removed from the course catalog, because that is one of the foundations of learning how to learn. 
As I got older, I learned the power of being able to freely think through problems and challenges that I encounter.
 Today, I use critical thinking skills that I learned in college to help me traverse the massive amounts of information, and dis-information, that is available to me.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am. Music and other arts have been stripped out of the curriculum of a lot of schools, leaving mainly creative writing as the only state sanctioned outlet for creativity. Creative pursuits should never be removed from the course catalog, because that is one of the foundations of learning how to learn. 
As I got older, I learned the power of being able to freely think through problems and challenges that I encounter.
 Today, I use critical thinking skills that I learned in college to help me traverse the massive amounts of information, and dis-information, that is available to me. With all that information sinking in, I need somewhere to put it. Music gives me that outlet, along with creative writing and some other, occasional, artistic pursuits.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am. Music and other arts have been stripped out of the curriculum of a lot of schools, leaving mainly creative writing as the only state sanctioned outlet for creativity. Creative pursuits should never be removed from the course catalog, because that is one of the foundations of learning how to learn. 
As I got older, I learned the power of being able to freely think through problems and challenges that I encounter.
 Today, I use critical thinking skills that I learned in college to help me traverse the massive amounts of information, and dis-information, that is available to me. With all that information sinking in, I need somewhere to put it. Music gives me that outlet, along with creative writing and some other, occasional, artistic pursuits.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity.

I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am. Music and other arts have been stripped out of the curriculum of a lot of schools, leaving mainly creative writing as the only state sanctioned outlet for creativity. Creative pursuits should never be removed from the course catalog, because that is one of the foundations of learning how to learn. 
As I got older, I learned the power of being able to freely think through problems and challenges that I encounter.
 Today, I use critical thinking skills that I learned in college to help me traverse the massive amounts of information, and dis-information, that is available to me.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am. Music and other arts have been stripped out of the curriculum of a lot of schools, leaving mainly creative writing as the only state sanctioned outlet for creativity. Creative pursuits should never be removed from the course catalog, because that is one of the foundations of learning how to learn. 
As I got older, I learned the power of being able to freely think through problems and challenges that I encounter.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am. Music and other arts have been stripped out of the curriculum of a lot of schools, leaving mainly creative writing as the only state sanctioned outlet for creativity. Creative pursuits should never be removed from the course catalog, because that is one of the foundations of learning how to learn. 
As I got older, I learned the power of being able to freely think through problems and challenges that I encounter.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am. Music and other arts have been stripped out of the curriculum of a lot of schools, leaving mainly creative writing as the only state sanctioned outlet for creativity. Creative pursuits should never be removed from the course catalog, because that is one of the foundations of learning how to learn. 
As I got older, I learned the power of being able to freely think through problems and challenges that I encounter.
 Today, I use critical thinking skills that I learned in college to help me traverse the massive amounts of information, and dis-information, that is available to me. With all that information sinking in, I need somewhere to put it. Music gives me that outlet, along with creative writing and some other, occasional, artistic pursuits. Those subjects have helped me to become a lifelong learner. I don't have all the answers, however I can always figure out where to go to get them.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am. Music and other arts have been stripped out of the curriculum of a lot of schools, leaving mainly creative writing as the only state sanctioned outlet for creativity. Creative pursuits should never be removed from the course catalog, because that is one of the foundations of learning how to learn. 
As I got older, I learned the power of being able to freely think through problems and challenges that I encounter.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am. Music and other arts have been stripped out of the curriculum of a lot of schools, leaving mainly creative writing as the only state sanctioned outlet for creativity. Creative pursuits should never be removed from the course catalog, because that is one of the foundations of learning how to learn. 
As I got older, I learned the power of being able to freely think through problems and challenges that I encounter.
 Today, I use critical thinking skills that I learned in college to help me traverse the massive amounts of information, and dis-information, that is available to me. With all that information sinking in, I need somewhere to put it. Music gives me that outlet, along with creative writing and some other, occasional, artistic pursuits.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am. Music and other arts have been stripped out of the curriculum of a lot of schools, leaving mainly creative writing as the only state sanctioned outlet for creativity. Creative pursuits should never be removed from the course catalog, because that is one of the foundations of learning how to learn. 
As I got older, I learned the power of being able to freely think through problems and challenges that I encounter.
 Today, I use critical thinking skills that I learned in college to help me traverse the massive amounts of information, and dis-information, that is available to me. With all that information sinking in, I need somewhere to put it. Music gives me that outlet, along with creative writing and some other, occasional, artistic pursuits. Those subjects have helped me to become a lifelong learner. I don't have all the answers, however I can always figure out where to go to get them.

In closing, I do not believe that there is any one, most important subject. I believe that critical thinking and creativity need to be the backbone of everything, and those require attention. Child",2775,[],1,,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,2206

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity.

 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity.

 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit.

As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am. Music and other arts have been stripped out of the curriculum of a lot of schools, leaving mainly creative writing as the only state sanctioned outlet for creativity. Creative pursuits should never be removed from the course catalog, because that is one of the foundations of learning how to learn. 
As I got older, I learned the power of being able to freely think through problems and challenges that I encounter.
 Today, I use critical thinking skills that I learned in college to help me traverse the massive amounts of information, and dis-information, that is available to me. With all that information sinking in, I need somewhere to put it. Music gives me that outlet, along with creative writing and some other, occasional, artistic pursuits. Those subjects have helped me to become a lifelong learner. I don't have all the answers, however I can always figure out where to go to get them.

In closing, I do not believe that there is any one, most important subject. I believe that critical thinking and creativity need to be the backbone of everything, and those require attention.

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am. Music and other arts have been stripped out of the curriculum of a lot of schools, leaving mainly creative writing as the only state sanctioned outlet for creativity. Creative pursuits should never be removed from the course catalog, because that is one of the foundations of learning how to learn. 
As I got older, I learned the power of being able to freely think through problems and challenges that I encounter.
 Today, I use critical thinking skills that I learned in college to help me traverse the massive amounts of information, and dis-information, that is available to me. With all that information sinking in, I need somewhere to put it. Music gives me that outlet, along with creative writing and some other, occasional, artistic pursuits. Those subjects have helped me to become a lifelong learner. I don't have all the answers, however I can always figure out where to go to get them.

In closing, I do not believe that there is any one, most important subject. I believe that critical thinking and creativity need to be the backbone of everything, and those require attention.
