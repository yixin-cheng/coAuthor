In my opinion, it is not a selfish endeavor to pursue extreme and dangerous sports. In fact, it is human nature to test the limits of personal potential and to push the boundaries of what is possible in the physical world. Some people get such high satisfaction from these activities that it is the focus of their lives. It is also true that many people say that the ability to be present or engaging with the ""here and now"" is greatly enhanced by more dangerous sports like mountain climbing since it becomes primary when doing these sports. This is not so much of a selfish endeavor as it is one of personal learning and growth.

In my opinion, it is not a selfish endeavor to pursue extreme and dangerous sports. In fact, it is human nature to test the limits of personal potential and to push the boundaries of what is possible in the physical world. Some people get such high satisfaction from these activities that it is the focus of their lives. It is also true that many people say that the ability to be present or engaging with the ""here and now"" is greatly enhanced by more dangerous sports like mountain climbing since it becomes primary when doing these sports. This is not so much of a selfish endeavor as it is one of personal learning and growth. 

There are risks involved with dangerous sports in nature, but there are also many risks in other sport activities. I believe anyone should be able to choose the sport they like to participate in, whether it be dangerous or not. It's dangerous to drive a car on the freeway, but we don't all stay home, because that is no way to live. 

I suppose in rare instances a line should be drawn. For example, if the person is the head of their household and is responsible for the care of people, then the activities with the most risk should maybe be avoided. However, this is still an issue that should be left up to the individual.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In fact, it is human nature to test the limits of personal potential and to push the boundaries of what is possible in the physical world. Some people get such high satisfaction from these activities that it is the focus of their lives. It is also true that many people say that the ability to be present or engaging with the ""here and now"" is greatly enhanced by more dangerous sports like mountain climbing since it becomes primary when doing these sports. This is not so much of a selfish endeavor as it is one of personal learning and growth.

I suppose in rare instances a line should be drawn. For example, if the person is the head of their household and is responsible for the care of people, then the activities with the most risk should maybe be avoided. However, this is still an issue that should be left up to the individual. 

No sport, in my opinion is too dangerous to be called a sport. The inherent risk in any sport ultimately lays on the shoulders of the individual who chooses to play that sport, and no one else.
