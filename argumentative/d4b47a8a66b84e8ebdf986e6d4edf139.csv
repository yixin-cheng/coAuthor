In my opinion, I disagree with the author's point that paying college athletes would somehow ruin college sports. I feel if the athletes generate so much attention and publicity that they are benefiting the bottom line of a university, then it's only fair that they should get a share of that benefit. 
I also think that paying college athletes would not necessarily cause a bidding war.
 There could be alternative ways of compensating them that don't involve unequal payments that would allow them to bid on the athletes in the first place. 
I disagree with the author's point that paying college athletes would distort the economics of college sports. because, as I previously stated, they could develop a system that works fairly and treats the athletes equally.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

In my opinion, I disagree with the author's point that paying college athletes would somehow ruin college sports. I feel if the athletes generate so much attention and publicity that they are benefiting the bottom line of a university, then it's only fair that they should get a share of that benefit. 
I also think that paying college athletes would not necessarily cause a bidding war.
 There could be alternative ways of compensating them that don't involve unequal payments that would allow them to bid on the athletes in the first place. 
I disagree with the author's point that paying college athletes would distort the economics of college sports. because, as I previously stated, they could develop a system that works fairly and treats the athletes equally. It may change the economics slightly by improving a system but this is not a bad thing. The athletes work hard and deserve their share of pay. Paying them, in my opinion would not ruin sports and I'm NOT persuaded by the author's argument.
