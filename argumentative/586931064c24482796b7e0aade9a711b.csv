In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a person is the one that makes them seem like a stereotype. This type of portrayal shows no creativity at all. There is no substance behind characters like this which in my opinion shows a lack of work ethic and creativity.

I wouldn't not watch a show or movie if a character was a stereotypical portray of a certain race, religion or ethnicity but it might bother me. Tony Soprano to me was somewhat of the stereotypical Italian mob boss but I loved that show. 

There are certain stereotypes that I hate seeing on TV and in movies. For example, the dumb blonde girl is one that is used so often and is just such a terrible portrayal of blonde women. I personally know many blonde women who are very intelligent and even run their own businesses.

I just feel like stereotypical portrayals are easy. They have been done to death. I would rather see a character that is more of an original. One that has some depth to them. You typically don't see that with stereotypical characters because the stereotype is their personality. 

Stereotypes in movies and film just annoy me to be honest. They turn me off. When I'm watching a movie or a television show I don't want to see characters and dialogue similar to things I have seen for decades. I want new, I want fresh and I want complex personalities.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a person is the one that makes them seem like a stereotype. This type of portrayal shows no creativity at all. There is no substance behind characters like this which in my opinion shows a lack of work ethic and creativity.

I wouldn't not watch a show or movie if a character was a stereotypical portray of a certain race, religion or ethnicity but it might bother me. Tony Soprano to me was somewhat of the stereotypical Italian mob boss but I loved that show. 

There are certain stereotypes that I hate seeing on TV and in movies. For example, the dumb blonde girl is one that is used so often and is just such a terrible portrayal of blonde women. I personally know many blonde women who are very intelligent and even run their own businesses.

I just feel like stereotypical portrayals are easy. They have been done to death. I would rather see a character that is more of an original. One that has some depth to them. You typically don't see that with stereotypical characters because the stereotype is their personality. 

Stereotypes in movies and film just annoy me to be honest. They turn me off. When I'm watching a movie or a television show I don't want to see characters and dialogue similar to things I have seen for decades. I want new, I want fresh and I want complex personalities.

The best characters are the ones that stand out and are unique. Stereotypes aren't unique. They're tired and boring. I've had enough of them in movies and TV. They're overdone.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a person is the one that makes them seem like a stereotype. This type of portrayal shows no creativity at all. There is no substance behind characters like this which in my opinion shows a lack of work ethic and creativity.

I wouldn't not watch a show or movie if a character was a stereotypical portray of a certain race, religion or ethnicity but it might bother me. Tony Soprano to me was somewhat of the stereotypical Italian mob boss but I loved that show. 

There are certain stereotypes that I hate seeing on TV and in movies. For example, the dumb blonde girl is one that is used so often and is just such a terrible portrayal of blonde women. I personally know many blonde women who are very intelligent and even run their own businesses.

I just feel like stereotypical portrayals are easy. They have been done to death. I would rather see a character that is more of an original. One that has some depth to them. You typically don't see that with stereotypical characters because the stereotype is their personality. 

Stereotypes in movies and film just annoy me to be honest. They turn me off. When I'm watching a movie or a television show I don't want to see characters and dialogue similar to things I have seen for decades. I want new, I want fresh and I want complex personalities.

The best characters are the ones that stand out and are unique. Stereotypes aren't unique. They're tired and boring. I've had enough of them in movies and TV. They're overdone.
