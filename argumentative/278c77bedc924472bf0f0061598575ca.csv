On the contrary, any steps to reduce suffering, whether human or nonhuman, should be taken. It is wrong to beat an living being.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, animals, particularly pets, are helpless. Compared to a human that can use their mind to assess the best action while being beaten, an animial can not easily escape a raging human. Animals can not do wrong in a moral sense. Humans, on the other hand, are flawed. 

People may beat other people and animals because they believe the beating will make the person change, or because they are angry.  There is, however, no reason ever, to harm either man or beast.  On the contrary, any steps to reduce suffering, whether human or nonhuman, should be taken. It is wrong to beat a living being. In fact, in America, this is referred to as assault and is against the law. The assailant can be fined and jailed.  So, hurting others is both lawless and immoral.

In my opinion, animals, particularly pets, are helpless. Compared to a human that can use their mind to assess the best action while being beaten, an animial can not easily escape a raging human. Animals can not do wrong in a moral sense. Humans, on the other hand, are flawed. 

People may beat other people and animals because they believe the beating will make the person change, or because they are angry.  There is, however, no reason ever, to harm either man or beast.  On the contrary, any steps to reduce suffering, whether human or nonhuman, should be taken. It is wrong to beat a living being. In fact, in America, this is referred to as assault and is against the law. The assailant can be fined and jailed.  So, hurting others is both lawless and immoral.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, animals, particularly pets, are helpless. Compared to a human that can use their mind to assess the best action while being beaten, an animial can not easily escape a raging human. Animals can not do wrong in a moral sense. Humans, on the other hand, are flawed. 

People may beat other people and animals because they believe the beating will make the person change, or because they are angry.  There is, however, no reason ever, to harm either man or beast.  On the contrary, any steps to reduce suffering, whether human or nonhuman, should be taken. It is wrong to beat a living being. In fact, in America, this is referred to as assault and is against the law. The assailant can be fined and jailed.  So, hurting others is both lawless and immoral.

On the contrary, any steps to reduce suffering, whether human or nonhuman, should be taken. It is wrong to beat a living being. In fact, in America, this is referred to as assault and is against the law. The assailant can be fined and jailed.  So, hurting others is both lawless and immoral.

People may beat other people and animals because they believe the beating will make the person change, or because they are angry.  There is, however, no reason ever, to harm either man or beast.  On the contrary, any steps to reduce suffering, whether human or nonhuman, should be taken. It is wrong to beat a living being. In fact, in America, this is referred to as assault and is against the law. The assailant can be fined and jailed.  So, hurting others is both lawless and immoral.

On the contrary, any steps to reduce suffering, whether human or nonhuman, should be taken. It is wrong to beat a living being. In fact, in America, this is referred to as assault and is against the law. The assailant can be fined and jailed.  So, hurting others is both lawless and immoral.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, animals, particularly pets, are helpless. Compared to a human that can use their mind to assess the best action while being beaten, an animial can not easily escape a raging human. Animals can not do wrong in a moral sense. Humans, on the other hand, are flawed. 

People may beat other people and animals because they believe the beating will make the person change, or because they are angry.  There is, however, no reason ever, to harm either man or beast.  On the contrary, any steps to reduce suffering, whether human or nonhuman, should be taken. It is wrong to beat a living being. In fact, in America, this is referred to as assault and is against the law. The assailant can be fined and jailed.  So, hurting others is both lawless and immoral.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, animals, particularly pets, are helpless. Compared to a human that can use their mind to assess the best action while being beaten, an animial can not easily escape a raging human. Animals can not do wrong in a moral sense. Humans, on the other hand, are flawed. 

People may beat other people and animals because they believe the beating will make the person change, or because they are angry.  There is, however, no reason ever, to harm either man or beast.  On the contrary, any steps to reduce suffering, whether human or nonhuman, should be taken. It is wrong to beat a living being. In fact, in America, this is referred to as assault and is against the law. The assailant can be fined and jailed.  So, hurting others is both lawless and immoral.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, animals, particularly pets, are helpless. Compared to a human that can use their mind to assess the best action while being beaten, an animial can not easily escape a raging human. Animals can not do wrong in a moral sense. Humans, on the other hand, are flawed. 

People may beat other people and animals because they believe the beating will make the person change, or because they are angry.  There is, however, no reason ever, to harm either man or beast.  On the contrary, any steps to reduce suffering, whether human or nonhuman, should be taken. It is wrong to beat a living being. In fact, in America, this is referred to as assault and is against the law. The assailant can be fined and jailed.  So, hurting others is both lawless and immoral. 

I think it is normal to have a disparity in the amount of concern for a suffering animal or person.  It would be wrong if a person chose to save an animal over a human.

On the contrary, any steps to reduce suffering, whether human or nonhuman, should be taken. It is wrong to beat a living being. In fact, in America, this is referred to as assault and is against the law. The assailant can be fined and jailed.  So, hurting others is both lawless and immoral. 

I think it is normal to have a disparity in the amount of concern for a suffering animal or person.  It would be wrong if a person chose to save an animal over a human. People are higher beings, spiritually.  They are higher on the food chain and the moral chain, if there is such a thing.  Animals and humans are not equals.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, animals, particularly pets, are helpless. Compared to a human that can use their mind to assess the best action while being beaten, an animial can not easily escape a raging human. Animals can not do wrong in a moral sense. Humans, on the other hand, are flawed. 

People may beat other people and animals because they believe the beating will make the person change, or because they are angry.  There is, however, no reason ever, to harm either man or beast.  On the contrary, any steps to reduce suffering, whether human or nonhuman, should be taken. It is wrong to beat a living being. In fact, in America, this is referred to as assault and is against the law. The assailant can be fined and jailed.  So, hurting others is both lawless and immoral.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, animals, particularly pets, are helpless. Compared to a human that can use their mind to assess the best action while being beaten, an animial can not easily escape a raging human. Animals can not do wrong in a moral sense. Humans, on the other hand, are flawed. 

People may beat other people and animals because they believe the beating will make the person change, or because they are angry.  There is, however, no reason ever, to harm either man or beast.  On the contrary, any steps to reduce suffering, whether human or nonhuman, should be taken. It is wrong to beat a living being. In fact, in America, this is referred to as assault and is against the law. The assailant can be fined and jailed.  So, hurting others is both lawless and immoral. 

I think it is normal to have a disparity in the amount of concern for a suffering animal or person.  It would be wrong if a person chose to save an animal over a human. People are higher beings, spiritually.  They are higher on the food chain and the moral chain, if there is such a thing.  Animals and humans are not equals.

People may beat other people and animals because they believe the beating will make the person change, or because they are angry.  There is, however, no reason ever, to harm either man or beast.  On the contrary, any steps to reduce suffering, whether human or nonhuman, should be taken. It is wrong to beat a living being. In fact, in America, this is referred to as assault and is against the law. The assailant can be fined and jailed.  So, hurting others is both lawless and immoral. 

I think it is normal to have a disparity in the amount of concern for a suffering animal or person.  It would be wrong if a person chose to save an animal over a human. People are higher beings, spiritually.  They are higher on the food chain and the moral chain, if there is such a thing.  Animals and humans are not equals.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, animals, particularly pets, are helpless. Compared to a human that can use their mind to assess the best action while being beaten, an animial can not easily escape a raging human. Animals can not do wrong in a moral sense. Humans, on the other hand, are flawed. 

People may beat other people and animals because they believe the beating will make the person change, or because they are angry.  There is, however, no reason ever, to harm either man or beast.  On the contrary, any steps to reduce suffering, whether human or nonhuman, should be taken. It is wrong to beat a living being. In fact, in America, this is referred to as assault and is against the law. The assailant can be fined and jailed.  So, hurting others is both lawless and immoral. 

I think it is normal to have a disparity in the amount of concern for a suffering animal or person.  It would be wrong if a person chose to save an animal over a human.

In my opinion, animals, particularly pets, are helpless. Compared to a human that can use their mind to assess the best action while being beaten, an animial can not easily escape a raging human. Animals can not do wrong in a moral sense. Humans, on the other hand, are flawed. 

People may beat other people and animals because they believe the beating will make the person change, or because they are angry.  There is, however, no reason ever, to harm either man or beast.  On the contrary, any steps to reduce suffering, whether human or nonhuman, should be taken. It is wrong to beat a living being. In fact, in America, this is referred to as assault and is against the law. The assailant can be fined and jailed.  So, hurting others is both lawless and immoral. 

I think it is normal to have a disparity in the amount of concern for a suffering animal or person.  It would be wrong if a person chose to save an animal over a human.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, animals, particularly pets, are helpless. Compared to a human that can use their mind to assess the best action while being beaten, an animial can not easily escape a raging human. Animals can not do wrong in a moral sense. Humans, on the other hand, are flawed. 

People may beat other people and animals because they believe the beating will make the person change, or because they are angry.  There is, however, no reason ever, to harm either man or beast.  On the contrary, any steps to reduce suffering, whether human or nonhuman, should be taken. It is wrong to beat a living being. In fact, in America, this is referred to as assault and is against the law. The assailant can be fined and jailed.  So, hurting others is both lawless and immoral.
