In my opinion, I believe that all people should be knowledgeable in their country and community.  As citizens we are expected to vote on a regular basis for the people that will lead us, on a national, state and local level.

So I believe that we are bad citizens if we do not keep up with what is going on in the world.  In addition, it can lead to bad consequences, where we end up with populist leaders, who are interested in appearance and not substance.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I believe that all people should be knowledgeable in their country and community.

In my opinion, I believe that all people should be knowledgeable in their country and community.  As citizens we are expected to vote on a regular basis for the people that will lead us, on a national, state and local level.  When we vote we should be well informed about the issues that candidates stand for and we should be able to make well informed choices.  So I believe that we are bad citizens if we do not keep up with what is going on in the world.  In addition, it can lead to bad consequences, where we end up with populist leaders, who are interested in appearance and not substance.  And we should not tolerate that in a functioning democratic society.  It is even dangerous for the continuation of our democracy.  To be good citizen we have to be aware of what is happening where we live, in our country', and in all corners of the world.  In addition, we should be part of a society that is active and makes its voice heard on political issues to get them addressed properly.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I believe that all people should be knowledgeable in their country and community.  As citizens we are expected to vote on a regular basis for the people that will lead us, on a national, state and local level.  When we vote we should be well informed about the issues that candidates stand for and we should be able to make well informed choices.  So I believe that we are bad citizens if we do not keep up with what is going on in the world.  In addition, it can lead to bad consequences, where we end up with populist leaders, who are interested in appearance and not substance.  And we should not tolerate that in a functioning democratic society.  It is even dangerous for the continuation of our democracy.  To be good citizen we have to be aware of what is happening where we live, in our country', and in all corners of the world.  In addition, we should be part of a society that is active and makes its voice heard on political issues to get them addressed properly.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I believe that all people should be knowledgeable in their country and community.

In addition, it can lead to bad consequences, where we end up with populist leaders, who are interested in appearance and not substance.

In my opinion, I believe that all people should be knowledgeable in their country and community.  As citizens we are expected to vote on a regular basis, for the people that will lead us, on a national, state and local level.  When we vote we should be well informed about the issues that candidates stand for and we should be able to make well informed choices.  So I believe that we are bad citizens if we do not keep up with what is going on in the world.  In addition, it can lead to bad consequences, where we end up with populist leaders, who are interested in appearance and not substance.  We should not tolerate that in a functioning democratic society.  It is even dangerous for the continuation of our democracy.  To be good citizen we have to be aware of what is happening where we live, in our country' and in all corners of the world.  In addition, we should be part of a society that is active and makes its voice heard on political issues to get them addressed properly.  Without knowledge we are unable to watch over what is done in our name, with our leader acting without impunity. Democracy is not just about elections; it is about being aware, participating in discourse, and holding our leaders accountable for their actions or in actions that they undertake.  So, in conclusion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news, as we are not fulfilling our duty as citizens. ",1145,[],3,3,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,960
