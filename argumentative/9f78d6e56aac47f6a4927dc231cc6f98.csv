In my opinion, stereotypical boy-obsessed women are the type of character that is hard to watch/read about.   I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story. And any messages, lessons, and most of the enjoyment of the story is lost.

In my opinion, stereotypical boy-obsessed women are the type of character that is hard to watch/read about.   I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story.

In my opinion, stereotypical boy-obsessed women are the type of character that is hard to watch/read about.   I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story. And any messages, lessons, and most of the enjoyment of the story is lost.

Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story. And any messages, lessons, and most of the enjoyment of the story is lost.

I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story.

In my opinion, stereotypical boy-obsessed women are the type of character that is hard to watch/read about.   I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.

I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story. And any messages, lessons, and most of the enjoyment of the story is lost.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypical boy-obsessed women are the type of character that is hard to watch/read about.   I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story. And any messages, lessons, and most of the enjoyment of the story is lost.

I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story.

Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story. And any messages, lessons, and most of the enjoyment of the story is lost.

And specifically, I think using this particular stereotype is a problem that goes past just being able to get something out of the work. It also reinforces real world stereotypes.

In my opinion, stereotypical boy-obsessed women are the type of character that is hard to watch/read about.   I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story. And any messages, lessons, and most of the enjoyment of the story is lost.

And specifically, I think using this particular stereotype is a problem that goes past just being able to get something out of the work. It also reinforces real world stereotypes.

In my opinion, stereotypical boy-obsessed women are the type of character that is hard to watch/read about.   I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable.

Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story. And any messages, lessons, and most of the enjoyment of the story is lost.

And specifically, I think using this particular stereotype is a problem that goes past just being able to get something out of the work. It also reinforces real world stereotypes. When the happy ending is the obsessed woman getting the man (boy, girl, other woman) it makes it seem like women are only good for one thing, and that's being a wife or girlfriend.

In my opinion, stereotypical boy-obsessed women are the type of character that is hard to watch/read about.   I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them.

In my opinion, stereotypical boy-obsessed women are the type of character that is hard to watch/read about.   I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.

I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story. And any messages, lessons, and most of the enjoyment of the story is lost.

And specifically, I think using this particular stereotype is a problem that goes past just being able to get something out of the work. It also reinforces real world stereotypes. When the happy ending is the obsessed woman getting the man (boy, girl, other woman) it makes it seem like women are only good for one thing, and that's being a wife or girlfriend.

In my opinion, stereotypical boy-obsessed women are the type of character that is hard to watch/read about.   I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.

In my opinion, stereotypical boy-obsessed women are the type of character that is hard to watch/read about.   I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story. And any messages, lessons, and most of the enjoyment of the story is lost.

And specifically, I think using this particular stereotype is a problem that goes past just being able to get something out of the work. It also reinforces real world stereotypes. When the happy ending is the obsessed woman getting the man (boy, girl, other woman) it makes it seem like women are only good for one thing, and that's being a wife or girlfriend.

In my opinion, stereotypical boy-obsessed women are the type of character that is hard to watch/read about.   I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story. And any messages, lessons, and most of the enjoyment of the story is lost.

And specifically, I think using this particular stereotype is a problem that goes past just being able to get something out of the work. It also reinforces real world stereotypes. When the happy ending is the obsessed woman getting the man (boy, girl, other woman) it makes it seem like women are only good for one thing, and that's being a wife or girlfriend.

In my opinion, stereotypical boy-obsessed women are the type of character that is hard to watch/read about.   I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story. And any messages, lessons, and most of the enjoyment of the story is lost.

And specifically, I think using this particular stereotype is a problem that goes past just being able to get something out of the work. It also reinforces real world stereotypes. When the happy ending is the obsessed woman getting the man (boy, girl, other woman) it makes it seem like women are only good for one thing, and that's being a wife or girlfriend.

In my opinion, stereotypical boy-obsessed women are the type of character that is hard to watch/read about.   I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story. And any messages, lessons, and most of the enjoyment of the story is lost.

And specifically, I think using this particular stereotype is a problem that goes past just being able to get something out of the work. It also reinforces real world stereotypes. When the happy ending is the obsessed woman getting the man (boy, girl, other woman) it makes it seem like women are only good for one thing, and that's being a wife or girlfriend.

In my opinion, stereotypical boy-obsessed women are the type of character that is hard to watch/read about.   I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story. And any messages, lessons, and most of the enjoyment of the story is lost.

And specifically, I think using this particular stereotype is a problem that goes past just being able to get something out of the work. It also reinforces real world stereotypes. When the happy ending is the obsessed woman getting the man (boy, girl, other woman) it makes it seem like women are only good for one thing, and that's being a wife or girlfriend. And this, at least today, is still seen as acceptable. And it's not. At least the assumption is not.

In my opinion, stereotypical boy-obsessed women are the type of character that is hard to watch/read about.   I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story. And any messages, lessons, and most of the enjoyment of the story is lost.

And specifically, I think using this particular stereotype is a problem that goes past just being able to get something out of the work. It also reinforces real world stereotypes.

In my opinion, stereotypical boy-obsessed women are the type of character that is hard to watch/read about.   I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypical boy-obsessed women are the type of character that is hard to watch/read about.   I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story. And any messages, lessons, and most of the enjoyment of the story is lost.

And specifically, I think using this particular stereotype is a problem that goes past just being able to get something out of the work. It also reinforces real world stereotypes. When the happy ending is the obsessed woman getting the man (boy, girl, other woman) it makes it seem like women are only good for one thing, and that's being a wife or girlfriend. And this, at least today, is still seen as acceptable. And it's not. At least the assumption is not.

In my opinion, stereotypical boy-obsessed women are the type of character that is hard to watch/read about.   I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.

Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story. And any messages, lessons, and most of the enjoyment of the story is lost.

And specifically, I think using this particular stereotype is a problem that goes past just being able to get something out of the work. It also reinforces real world stereotypes. When the happy ending is the obsessed woman getting the man (boy, girl, other woman) it makes it seem like women are only good for one thing, and that's being a wife or girlfriend. And this, at least today, is still seen as acceptable. And it's not. At least the assumption is not. It takes away from the choice of a woman to choose relationships over other things; like they never made that choice it just happened to them as the natural order. So it hurts not only women who make the opposite choice, but also the women who are focused primarily on relationships, and all types of women in ",2076,[],0,0,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1777

In my opinion, stereotypical boy-obsessed women are the type of character that is hard to watch/read about.   I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story. And any messages, lessons, and most of the enjoyment of the story is lost.

In my opinion, stereotypical boy-obsessed women are the type of character that is hard to watch/read about.   I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story. And any messages, lessons, and most of the enjoyment of the story is lost.

And specifically, I think using this particular stereotype is a problem that goes past just being able to get something out of the work. It also reinforces real world stereotypes. When the happy ending is the obsessed woman getting the man (boy, girl, other woman) it makes it seem like women are only good for one thing, and that's being a wife or girlfriend. And this, at least today, is still seen as acceptable. And it's not. At least the assumption is not. It takes away from the choice of a woman to choose relationships over other things; like they never made that choice it just happened to them as the natural order. So it hurts not only women who make the opposite choice, but also the women who are focused primarily on relationships, and all types of women in between.

It takes away from the choice of a woman to choose relationships over other things; like they never made that choice it just happened to them as the natural order. So it hurts not only women who make the opposite choice, but also the women who are focused primarily on relationships, and all types of women in between.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypical boy-obsessed women are the type of character that is hard to watch/read about.   I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story. And any messages, lessons, and most of the enjoyment of the story is lost.
