In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive.


egarding the first of the questions, consider that research subjects who were asked about animal suffering were distressed by stories about a dog being beaten with a
 baseball bat yet did not feel disturbed about an adult being beaten with a similar weapon. The truth about humans is harsh: the majority of humans are being beaten with the ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is new and different, and is something we can controltherefore evoking stronger response.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive.


egarding the first of the questions, consider that research subjects who were asked about animal suffering were distressed by stories about a dog being beaten with a
 baseball bat yet did not feel disturbed about an adult being beaten with a similar weapon. The truth about humans is harsh: the majority of humans are being beaten with the ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

lso, stories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral.

The truth about humans is harsh: the majority of humans are being beaten with the ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive.

The truth about humans is harsh: the majority of humans are being beaten with the ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is so new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

lso, stories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive.

The truth about humans is harsh: the majority of humans are being beaten with the ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice.

 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral.

The truth about humans is harsh: the majority of humans are being beaten with the ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response.

The truth about humans is harsh: the majority of humans are being beaten with the ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response.

The truth about humans is harsh: the majority of humans are being beaten with the ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response.

 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow on its knees in a slaughterhouse, its tongue forced down its throat, but when I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a generic starving person in Africa.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: the majority of humans are being beaten with the ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

lso, stories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow on its knees in a slaughterhouse, its tongue forced down its throat, but when I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a generic starving person in Africa.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow on its knees in a slaughterhouse, its tongue forced down its throat, but when I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a generic starving person in Africa.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow on its knees in a slaughterhouse, its tongue forced down its throat, but when I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a generic starving person in Africa.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow on its knees in a slaughterhouse, its tongue forced down its throat, but when I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a generic starving person in Africa.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow on its knees in a slaughterhouse, its tongue forced down its throat, but when I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a generic starving person in Africa.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow on its knees in a slaughterhouse, its tongue forced down its throat, but when I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a generic starving person in Africa.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response.

The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow on its knees in a slaughterhouse, its tongue forced down its throat, but when I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a generic starving person in Africa.

I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow on its knees in a slaughterhouse, its tongue forced down its throat, but when I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a generic starving person in Africa. 

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerl. We can donate to food pantrie

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow on its knees in a slaughterhouse, its tongue forced down its throat, but when I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a generic starving person in Africa.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow on its knees in a slaughterhouse, its tongue forced down its throat, but when I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a generic starving person in Africa.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow on its knees in a slaughterhouse, its tongue forced down its throat, but when I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a generic starving person in Africa.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow on its knees in a slaughterhouse, its tongue forced down its throat, but when I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a generic starving person in Africa.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response.

We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow on its knees in a slaughterhouse, its tongue forced down its throat, but when I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a mgeneric starving person in Africa.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow on its knees in a slaughterhouse, its tongue forced down its throat, but when I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's pgeneric starving person in Africa. 

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to affect human suffering. We can donate to food pantries, visit nursing homes, build houses, and mentor children.  all of these

I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow on its knees in a slaughterhouse, its tongue forced down its throat, but when I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Diasy on its knees in a slaughterhouse, its tongue forced down its throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa. 

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to affect human suffering. We can donate to food pantries, visit nursing homes, build houses, and mentor children.  all of these

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on herknees in a slaughterhouse, its tongue forced down its throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on her knees in a slaughterhouse, her tongue forced down her throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on her knees in a slaughterhouse, her tongue forced down her throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa. 

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to affect human suffering. We can donate to food pantries, visit nursing homes, volunteer to build houses, and mentor children.  All of these as easy-to-do, a

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on her knees in a slaughterhouse, her tongue forced down her throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral.

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on her knees in a slaughterhouse, her tongue forced down her throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa. 

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to affect human suffering.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on her knees in a slaughterhouse, her tongue forced down her throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa. 

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to affect human suffering. We can donate to food pantries, visit nursing homes, volunteer to build houses, and mentor children.  All of these as easy-to-do, and give us power to control the suffering around us.  On

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on her knees in a slaughterhouse, her tongue forced down her throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa. 

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to affect human suffering. We can donate to food pantries, visit nursing homes, volunteer to build houses, and mentor children.  All of these as easy-to-do, and give us power to control the suffering around us.

We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on her knees in a slaughterhouse, her tongue forced down her throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa. 

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to affect human suffering. We can donate to food pantries, visit nursing homes, volunteer to build houses, and mentor children.  All of these as easy-to-do, and give us power to control the suffering around us.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on her knees in a slaughterhouse, her tongue forced down her throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa. 

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to affect human suffering. We can donate to food pantries, visit nursing homes, volunteer to build houses, and mentor children.  All of these as easy-to-do, and give us power to control the suffering around us.

The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on her knees in a slaughterhouse, her tongue forced down her throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa. 

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to affect human suffering. We can donate to food pantries, visit nursing homes, volunteer to build houses, and mentor children.  All of these as easy-to-do, and give us power to control the suffering around us.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to affect human suffering.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on her knees in a slaughterhouse, her tongue forced down her throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa. 

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to affect human suffering. We can donate to food pantries, visit nursing homes, volunteer to build houses, and mentor children.  All of these as easy-to-do, and give us power to control the suffering around us.

We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral.

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to affect human suffering.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on her knees in a slaughterhouse, her tongue forced down her throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa. 

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to affect human suffering. We can donate to food pantries, visit nursing homes, volunteer to build houses, and mentor children.  All of these as easy-to-do, and give us power to control the suffering around us.

I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on her knees in a slaughterhouse, her tongue forced down her throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa. 

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to affect human suffering. We can donate to food pantries, visit nursing homes, volunteer to build houses, and mentor children.  All of these as easy-to-do, and give us power to control the suffering around us.  Once w

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response.

I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on her knees in a slaughterhouse, her tongue forced down her throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa. 

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to improve human suffering. We can donate to food pantries, visit nursing homes, volunteer to build houses, and mentor children.  All of these as easy-to-do, and give us power to control the suffering around us.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on her knees in a slaughterhouse, her tongue forced down her throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on her knees in a slaughterhouse, her tongue forced down her throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa. 

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to improve lives, and remove pain. We can donate to food pantries, visit nursing homes, volunteer to build houses, and mentor children.  All of these as easy-to-do, and give us power to control the suffering around us.

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on her knees in a slaughterhouse, her tongue forced down her throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa. 

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to improve lives, and remove pain. We can donate to food pantries, visit nursing homes, volunteer to build houses, and mentor children.  All of these as easy-to-do, and give us power to control the suffering around us.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on her knees in a slaughterhouse, her tongue forced down her throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa. 

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to improve lives, and remove pain. We can donate to food pantries, visit nursing homes, volunteer to build houses, and mentor children.  All of these as easy-to-do, and give us power to control the suffering around us.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on her knees in a slaughterhouse, her tongue forced down her throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa. 

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to improve lives, and remove pain. We can donate to food pantries, visit nursing homes, volunteer to build houses, and mentor children.  All of these as easy-to-do, and give us power to control the suffering around us.  We can make humans happier, and happy people in turn, don't hurt oanimals.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on her knees in a slaughterhouse, her tongue forced down her throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa. 

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to improve lives, and remove pain. We can donate to food pantries, visit nursing homes, volunteer to build houses, and mentor children.  All of these as easy-to-do, and give us power to control the suffering around us.  We can make humans happier, and happy people in turn, don't hurt other peoplanimals.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on her knees in a slaughterhouse, her tongue forced down her throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa. 

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to improve lives, and remove pain. We can donate to food pantries, visit nursing homes, volunteer to build houses, and mentor children.  All of these as easy-to-do, and give us power to control the suffering around us.  We can make humans healthiehappier, and happy people in turn, don't hurt other people or animals.
