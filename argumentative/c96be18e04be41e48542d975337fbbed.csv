In my opinion, I don't think we are bad people if we don't keep up with the news. There are some people who don't, and that's fine. Many people who don't keep up with the news do that on purpose. It brings a sense of calm and relief to them. I can not say I blame them.

I do personally watch the news, but hey lets be honest here. I have myself thought about giving up watching the news, or at least being far more selective about what news I do watch. A few times it does feel like the news will depress me all day, because everything seems so broken now. It doesn't seem the same as the news my parents used to watch. There doesn't really seem to be any unbias news channels out there anymore. It's all political agendas, and most will try to manipulate you into agreeing with them, or call you stupid if you don't agree with them.

Let's face it, this country is so divided now that it is almost unbelievable. I feel like the news no longer paints us as Americans, but instead as democrats, republicans, or to cowardly to choose a side. I'm not sure how we can move forward until we can get people to stop hating each other, and remember that we are all from the same place. We are friends, neighbors, family, co-workers, and most of all Americans. It's ok to have different opinions, but it is not ok that the media makes us turn on each other.
