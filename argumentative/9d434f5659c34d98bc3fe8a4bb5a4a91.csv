Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it  Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because in general human have more agency than animals. They certainly have more rights. But as for animal rights, they barely exist, if at all, in most countries of the world.

The history of civilization is the history of expanding the universe of rights-bearing sentient beings. For a while, slaves did not rights, then women had no rights, and now it is time to realize that animals should have rights as well. There is no qualitative difference between the suffering of an animal or that of a human. We have a moral duty to treat sentient beings with respect and to reduce their suffering. This is not a proposition to be argued for, rather, it is a moral imperative which is axiomatic.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because in general human have more agency than animals. They certainly have more rights. But as for animal rights, they barely exist, if at all, in most countries of the world.

The history of civilization is the history of expanding the universe of rights-bearing sentient beings. For a while, slaves did not rights, then women had no rights, and now it is time to realize that animals should have rights as well. There is no qualitative difference between the suffering of an animal or that of a human. We have a moral duty to treat sentient beings with respect and to reduce their suffering. This is not a proposition to be argued for, rather, it is a moral imperative which is axiomatic.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because in general human have more agency than animals. They certainly have more rights. But as for animal rights, they barely exist, if at all, in most countries of the world.

For a while, slaves did not rights, then women had no rights, and now it is time to realize that animals should have rights as well. There is no qualitative difference between the suffering of an animal or that of a human. We have a moral duty to treat sentient beings with respect and to reduce their suffering. This is not a proposition to be argued for, rather, it is a moral imperative which is axiomatic.

How can we work to reduce animal suffering? We can insist that farm animals be treated humanely, or else become vegetarian. We can also work to reduce the suffering of wild animals by supporting animal preserves and parks where animals are free to roam.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because in general human have more agency than animals. They certainly have more rights. But as for animal rights, they barely exist, if at all, in most countries of the world.

For a while, slaves did not rights, then women had no rights, and now it is time to realize that animals should have rights as well. There is no qualitative difference between the suffering of an animal or that of a human. We have a moral duty to treat sentient beings with respect and to reduce their suffering. This is not a proposition to be argued for, rather, it is a moral imperative which is axiomatic.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because in general human have more agency than animals. They certainly have more rights. But as for animal rights, they barely exist, if at all, in most countries of the world.

For a while, slaves did not rights, then women had no rights, and now it is time to realize that animals should have rights as well. There is no qualitative difference between the suffering of an animal or that of a human. We have a moral duty to treat sentient beings with respect and to reduce their suffering. This is not a proposition to be argued for, rather, it is a moral imperative which is axiomatic.

How can we work to reduce animal suffering? We can insist that farm animals be treated humanely, or else become vegetarian. We can also work to reduce the suffering of wild animals by supporting animal preserves and parks where animals are free to roam.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because in general human have more agency than animals. They certainly have more rights. But as for animal rights, they barely exist, if at all, in most countries of the world.

For a while, slaves did not rights, then women had no rights, and now it is time to realize that animals should have rights as well.

This is not a proposition to be argued for, rather, it is a moral imperative which is axiomatic.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because in general human have more agency than animals. They certainly have more rights. But as for animal rights, they barely exist, if at all, in most countries of the world.

The history of civilization is the history of expanding the universe of rights-bearing sentient beings. For a while, slaves did not rights, then women had no rights, and now it is time to realize that animals should have rights as well. There is no qualitative difference between the suffering of an animal or that of a human. We have a moral duty to treat sentient beings with respect and to reduce their suffering. This is not a proposition to be argued for, rather, it is a moral imperative which is axiomatic.

How can we work to reduce animal suffering? We can insist that farm animals be treated humanely, or else become vegetarian.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because in general human have more agency than animals. They certainly have more rights. But as for animal rights, they barely exist, if at all, in most countries of the world.

The history of civilization is the history of expanding the universe of rights-bearing sentient beings. For a while, slaves did not rights, then women had no rights, and now it is time to realize that animals should have rights as well. There is no qualitative difference between the suffering of an animal or that of a human. We have a moral duty to treat sentient beings with respect and to reduce their suffering. This is not a proposition to be argued for, rather, it is a moral imperative which is axiomatic.

How can we work to reduce animal suffering? We can insist that farm animals be treated humanely, or else become vegetarian. We can also work to reduce the suffering of wild animals by supporting animal preserves and parks where animals are free to roam. We can also work to reduce the suffering of animals in laboratories by supporting animal rights groups who work to improve the conditions of animals in laboratories.

We  can also be kind to animals in our daily lives. We can stop kicking dogs, we can stop torturing cats, we can stop using animals for sport or entertainment. We can stop eating meat, we can stop wearing fur, we can stop using animals for scientific research.  We can feed wild animals in times of estreme weather, and drive with care near animal crossing",2072,[],0,1,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1226

How can we work to reduce animal suffering? We can insist that farm animals be treated humanely, or else become vegetarian. We can also work to reduce the suffering of wild animals by supporting animal preserves and parks where animals are free to roam. We can also work to reduce the suffering of animals in laboratories by supporting animal rights groups who work to improve the conditions of animals in laboratories.

We can stop eating meat, we can stop wearing fur, we can stop using animals for scientific research.  We can feed wild animals in times of extreme weather, and drive with care near animal crossings.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because in general human have more agency than animals. They certainly have more rights. But as for animal rights, they barely exist, if at all, in most countries of the world.

For a while, slaves did not rights, then women had no rights, and now it is time to realize that animals should have rights as well.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because in general human have more agency than animals. They certainly have more rights. But as for animal rights, they barely exist, if at all, in most countries of the world.

The history of civilization is the history of expanding the universe of rights-bearing sentient beings. For a while, slaves did not rights, then women had no rights, and now it is time to realize that animals should have rights as well. There is no qualitative difference between the suffering of an animal or that of a human. We have a moral duty to treat sentient beings with respect and to reduce their suffering. This is not a proposition to be argued for, rather, it is a moral imperative which is axiomatic.

How can we work to reduce animal suffering? We can insist that farm animals be treated humanely, or else become vegetarian. We can also work to reduce the suffering of wild animals by supporting animal preserves and parks where animals are free to roam. We can also work to reduce the suffering of animals in laboratories by supporting animal rights groups who work to improve the conditions of animals in laboratories.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because in general human have more agency than animals. They certainly have more rights. But as for animal rights, they barely exist, if at all, in most countries of the world.

The history of civilization is the history of expanding the universe of rights-bearing sentient beings. For a while, slaves did not rights, then women had no rights, and now it is time to realize that animals should have rights as well. There is no qualitative difference between the suffering of an animal or that of a human. We have a moral duty to treat sentient beings with respect and to reduce their suffering. This is not a proposition to be argued for, rather, it is a moral imperative which is axiomatic.

How can we work to reduce animal suffering? We can insist that farm animals be treated humanely, or else become vegetarian. We can also work to reduce the suffering of wild animals by supporting animal preserves and parks where animals are free to roam. We can also work to reduce the suffering of animals in laboratories by supporting animal rights groups who work to improve the conditions of animals in laboratories.

We  can also be kind to animals in our daily lives. We can stop kicking dogs, we can stop torturing cats, we can stop using animals for sport or entertainment. We can stop eating meat, we can stop wearing fur, we can stop using animals for scientific research.  We can feed wild animals in times of extreme weather, and drive with care near animal crossings.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because in general human have more agency than animals. They certainly have more rights. But as for animal rights, they barely exist, if at all, in most countries of the world.

The history of civilization is the history of expanding the universe of rights-bearing sentient beings. For a while, slaves did not rights, then women had no rights, and now it is time to realize that animals should have rights as well. There is no qualitative difference between the suffering of an animal or that of a human. We have a moral duty to treat sentient beings with respect and to reduce their suffering. This is not a proposition to be argued for, rather, it is a moral imperative which is axiomatic.

How can we work to reduce animal suffering? We can insist that farm animals be treated humanely, or else become vegetarian. We can also work to reduce the suffering of wild animals by supporting animal preserves and parks where animals are free to roam. We can also work to reduce the suffering of animals in laboratories by supporting animal rights groups who work to improve the conditions of animals in laboratories.

We  can also be kind to animals in our daily lives. We can stop kicking dogs, we can stop torturing cats, we can stop using animals for sport or entertainment. We can stop eating meat, we can stop wearing fur, we can stop using animals for scientific research.  We can feed wild animals in times of extreme weather, and drive with care near animal crossings.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because in general human have more agency than animals. They certainly have more rights. But as for animal rights, they barely exist, if at all, in most countries of the world.

The history of civilization is the history of expanding the universe of rights-bearing sentient beings. For a while, slaves did not rights, then women had no rights, and now it is time to realize that animals should have rights as well. There is no qualitative difference between the suffering of an animal or that of a human. We have a moral duty to treat sentient beings with respect and to reduce their suffering. This is not a proposition to be argued for, rather, it is a moral imperative which is axiomatic.

How can we work to reduce animal suffering? We can insist that farm animals be treated humanely, or else become vegetarian. We can also work to reduce the suffering of wild animals by supporting animal preserves and parks where animals are free to roam. We can also work to reduce the suffering of animals in laboratories by supporting animal rights groups who work to improve the conditions of animals in laboratories.

We  can also be kind to animals in our daily lives. We can stop kicking dogs, we can stop torturing cats, we can stop using animals for sport or entertainment. We can stop eating meat, we can stop wearing fur, we can stop using animals for scientific research.  We can feed wild animals in times of extreme weather, and drive with care near animal crossings.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because in general human have more agency than animals. They certainly have more rights. But as for animal rights, they barely exist, if at all, in most countries of the world.

The history of civilization is the history of expanding the universe of rights-bearing sentient beings. For a while, slaves did not rights, then women had no rights, and now it is time to realize that animals should have rights as well. There is no qualitative difference between the suffering of an animal or that of a human. We have a moral duty to treat sentient beings with respect and to reduce their suffering. This is not a proposition to be argued for, rather, it is a moral imperative which is axiomatic.

How can we work to reduce animal suffering? We can insist that farm animals be treated humanely, or else become vegetarian. We can also work to reduce the suffering of wild animals by supporting animal preserves and parks where animals are free to roam. We can also work to reduce the suffering of animals in laboratories by supporting animal rights groups who work to improve the conditions of animals in laboratories.

How can we work to reduce animal suffering? We can insist that farm animals be treated humanely, or else become vegetarian.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because in general human have more agency than animals. They certainly have more rights. But as for animal rights, they barely exist, if at all, in most countries of the world.

The history of civilization is the history of expanding the universe of rights-bearing sentient beings. For a while, slaves did not rights, then women had no rights, and now it is time to realize that animals should have rights as well. There is no qualitative difference between the suffering of an animal or that of a human. We have a moral duty to treat sentient beings with respect and to reduce their suffering. This is not a proposition to be argued for, rather, it is a moral imperative which is axiomatic.

How can we work to reduce animal suffering? We can insist that farm animals be treated humanely, or else become vegetarian. We can also work to reduce the suffering of wild animals by supporting animal preserves and parks where animals are free to roam. We can also work to reduce the suffering of animals in laboratories by supporting animal rights groups who work to improve the conditions of animals in laboratories.

We  can also be kind to animals in our daily lives. We can stop kicking dogs, we can stop torturing cats, we can stop using animals for sport or entertainment. We can stop eating meat, we can stop wearing fur, we can stop using animals for scientific research.  We can feed wild animals in times of extreme weather, and drive with care near animal crossings.

The history of civilization is the history of expanding the universe of rights-bearing sentient beings. For a while, slaves did not rights, then women had no rights, and now it is time to realize that animals should have rights as well. There is no qualitative difference between the suffering of an animal or that of a human. We have a moral duty to treat sentient beings with respect and to reduce their suffering. This is not a proposition to be argued for, rather, it is a moral imperative which is axiomatic.

How can we work to reduce animal suffering? We can insist that farm animals be treated humanely, or else become vegetarian. We can also work to reduce the suffering of wild animals by supporting animal preserves and parks where animals are free to roam. We can also work to reduce the suffering of animals in laboratories by supporting animal rights groups who work to improve the conditions of animals in laboratories.

We  can also be kind to animals in our daily lives. We can stop kicking dogs, we can stop torturing cats, we can stop using animals for sport or entertainment. We can stop eating meat, we can stop wearing fur, we can stop using animals for scientific research.  We can feed wild animals in times of extreme weather, and drive with care near animal crossings.

The history of civilization is the history of expanding the universe of rights-bearing sentient beings. For a while, slaves did not rights, then women had no rights, and now it is time to realize that animals should have rights as well. There is no qualitative difference between the suffering of an animal or that of a human. We have a moral duty to treat sentient beings with respect and to reduce their suffering. This is not a proposition to be argued for, rather, it is a moral imperative which is axiomatic.

How can we work to reduce animal suffering? We can insist that farm animals be treated humanely, or else become vegetarian. We can also work to reduce the suffering of wild animals by supporting animal preserves and parks where animals are free to roam. We can also work to reduce the suffering of animals in laboratories by supporting animal rights groups who work to improve the conditions of animals in laboratories.

We  can also be kind to animals in our daily lives. We can stop kicking dogs, we can stop torturing cats, we can stop using animals for sport or entertainment. We can stop eating meat, we can stop wearing fur, we can stop using animals for scientific research.  We can feed wild animals in times of extreme weather, and drive with care near animal crossings.

There are already ample organization to support human rights and needs. And that is good. But to draw a contrast between helping suffering animals versus humans is a false dichotomy.",2258,[],0,3,5,30,0.2,1,0,0.5,1434

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because in general humans have more agency than animals. They certainly have more rights. But as for animal rights, they barely exist, if at all, in most countries of the world.

The history of civilization is the history of expanding the universe of rights-bearing sentient beings. For a while, slaves did not rights, then women had no rights, and now it is time to realize that animals should have rights as well. There is no qualitative difference between the suffering of an animal or that of a human. We have a moral duty to treat sentient beings with respect and to reduce their suffering. This is not a proposition to be argued for, rather, it is a moral imperative which is axiomatic.

How can we work to reduce animal suffering? We can insist that farm animals be treated humanely, or else become vegetarian. We can also work to reduce the suffering of wild animals by supporting animal preserves and parks where animals are free to roam. We can also work to reduce the suffering of animals in laboratories by supporting animal rights groups who work to improve the conditions of animals in laboratories.

We  can also be kind to animals in our daily lives. We can stop kicking dogs, we can stop torturing cats, we can stop using animals for sport or entertainment.
