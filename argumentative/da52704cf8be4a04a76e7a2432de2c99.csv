Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, not at all. We all live on the same planet and no matter how much we try to remove ourselves from nature, we are still part of it along with all the animals and other living beings. If our animals are looked well taken care of, humans will benefit from it as well. Both with  healthy meats and strong, healthy bonds between pets. Also, when wild animals are better preserved, they are less likely to get diseased and there would be less of a chance of those diseases making their way into the human population. Of course, this is not always possible. There will be viruses that come from nature no matter how good we treat it but there will be less.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, not at all. We all live on the same planet and no matter how much we try to remove ourselves from nature, we are still part of it along with all the animals and other living beings. If our animals are looked well taken care of, humans will benefit from it as well. Both with  healthy meats and strong, healthy bonds between pets.

In my opinion, not at all. We all live on the same planet and no matter how much we try to remove ourselves from nature, we are still part of it along with all the animals and other living beings. If our animals are looked well taken care of, humans will benefit from it as well. Both with  healthy meats and strong, healthy bonds between pets. Also, when wild animals are better preserved, they are less likely to get diseased and there would be less of a chance of those diseases making their way into the human population.

In my opinion, not at all. We all live on the same planet and no matter how much we try to remove ourselves from nature, we are still part of it along with all the animals and other living beings. If our animals are looked well taken care of, humans will benefit from it as well. Both with  healthy meats and strong, healthy bonds between pets.

In my opinion, not at all. We all live on the same planet and no matter how much we try to remove ourselves from nature, we are still part of it along with all the animals and other living beings. If our animals are looked well taken care of, humans will benefit from it as well. Both with  healthy meats and strong, healthy bonds between pets. Also, when wild animals are better preserved, they are less likely to get diseased and there would be less of a chance of those diseases making their way into the human population. Of course, this is not always possible. There will be viruses that come from nature no matter how good we treat it but there will be less. 
I also think how we treat our animals and their habitats are a reflection of us as a whole. If we destroy them without much thought then we are more likely to destroy ourselves. ",1421,[],0,0,5,30,0.9,1,0,0.5,1066

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, not at all. We all live on the same planet and no matter how much we try to remove ourselves from nature, we are still part of it along with all the animals and other living beings. If our animals are looked well taken care of, humans will benefit from it as well. Both with  healthy meats and strong, healthy bonds between pets. Also, when wild animals are better preserved, they are less likely to get diseased and there would be less of a chance of those diseases making their way into the human population. Of course, this is not always possible. There will be viruses that come from nature no matter how good we treat it but there will be less.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, not at all. We all live on the same planet and no matter how much we try to remove ourselves from nature, we are still part of it along with all the animals and other living beings. If our animals are looked well taken care of, humans will benefit from it as well. Both with  healthy meats and strong, healthy bonds between pets. Also, when wild animals are better preserved, they are less likely to get diseased and there would be less of a chance of those diseases making their way into the human population. Of course, this is not always possible. There will be viruses that come from nature no matter how good we treat it but there will be less. 
I also think how we treat our animals and their habitats are a reflection of us as a whole. If we destroy them without much thought then we are more likely to destroy ourselves.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, not at all. We all live on the same planet and no matter how much we try to remove ourselves from nature, we are still part of it along with all the animals and other living beings. If our animals are looked well taken care of, humans will benefit from it as well. Both with  healthy meats and strong, healthy bonds between pets. Also, when wild animals are better preserved, they are less likely to get diseased and there would be less of a chance of those diseases making their way into the human population. Of course, this is not always possible. There will be viruses that come from nature no matter how good we treat it but there will be less. 
I also think how we treat our animals and their habitats are a reflection of us as a whole. If we destroy them without much thought then we are more likely to destroy ourselves.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, not at all. We all live on the same planet and no matter how much we try to remove ourselves from nature, we are still part of it along with all the animals and other living beings. If our animals are looked well taken care of, humans will benefit from it as well. Both with  healthy meats and strong, healthy bonds between pets. Also, when wild animals are better preserved, they are less likely to get diseased and there would be less of a chance of those diseases making their way into the human population. Of course, this is not always possible. There will be viruses that come from nature no matter how good we treat it but there will be less.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, not at all. We all live on the same planet and no matter how much we try to remove ourselves from nature, we are still part of it along with all the animals and other living beings. If our animals are looked well taken care of, humans will benefit from it as well. Both with  healthy meats and strong, healthy bonds between pets. Also, when wild animals are better preserved, they are less likely to get diseased and there would be less of a chance of those diseases making their way into the human population. Of course, this is not always possible. There will be viruses that come from nature no matter how good we treat it but there will be less. 
I also think how we treat our animals and their habitats are a reflection of us as a whole. If we destroy them without much thought then we are more likely to destroy ourselves. The world is a relatively small place. We all share it, the more we protect it the more we protect ourselves. The healthier nature is the healthier we are since we too are part of nature.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, not at all. We all live on the same planet and no matter how much we try to remove ourselves from nature, we are still part of it along with all the animals and other living beings. If our animals are looked well taken care of, humans will benefit from it as well. Both with  healthy meats and strong, healthy bonds between pets. Also, when wild animals are better preserved, they are less likely to get diseased and there would be less of a chance of those diseases making their way into the human population. Of course, this is not always possible. There will be viruses that come from nature no matter how good we treat it but there will be less. 
I also think how we treat our animals and their habitats are a reflection of us as a whole. If we destroy them without much thought then we are more likely to destroy ourselves.

In my opinion, not at all. We all live on the same planet and no matter how much we try to remove ourselves from nature, we are still part of it along with all the animals and other living beings. If our animals are looked well taken care of, humans will benefit from it as well. Both with  healthy meats and strong, healthy bonds between pets. Also, when wild animals are better preserved, they are less likely to get diseased and there would be less of a chance of those diseases making their way into the human population. Of course, this is not always possible. There will be viruses that come from nature no matter how good we treat it but there will be less. 
I also think how we treat our animals and their habitats are a reflection of us as a whole. If we destroy them without much thought then we are more likely to destroy ourselves. The world is a relatively small place. We all share it, the more we protect it the more we protect ourselves. The healthier nature is the healthier we are since are all part of nature.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, not at all. We all live on the same planet and no matter how much we try to remove ourselves from nature, we are still part of it along with all the animals and other living beings. If our animals are looked well taken care of, humans will benefit from it as well. Both with  healthy meats and strong, healthy bonds between pets. Also, when wild animals are better preserved, they are less likely to get diseased and there would be less of a chance of those diseases making their way into the human population. Of course, this is not always possible. There will be viruses that come from nature no matter how good we treat it but there will be less. 
I also think how we treat our animals and their habitats are a reflection of us as a whole. If we destroy them without much thought then we are more likely to destroy ourselves. The world is a relatively small place. We all share it, the more we protect it the more we protect ourselves. The healthier nature is the healthier we are since are all part of nature. 
So in  don't think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, not at all. We all live on the same planet and no matter how much we try to remove ourselves from nature, we are still part of it along with all the animals and other living beings. If our animals are looked well taken care of, humans will benefit from it as well. Both with  healthy meats and strong, healthy bonds between pets. Also, when wild animals are better preserved, they are less likely to get diseased and there would be less of a chance of those diseases making their way into the human population. Of course, this is not always possible. There will be viruses that come from nature no matter how good we treat it but there will be less. 
I also think how we treat our animals and their habitats are a reflection of us as a whole. If we destroy them without much thought then we are more likely to destroy ourselves. The world is a relatively small place. We all share it, the more we protect it the more we protect ourselves. The healthier nature is the healthier we are since are all part of nature.

Also, when wild animals are better preserved, they are less likely to get diseased and there would be less of a chance of those diseases making their way into the human population. Of course, this is not always possible. There will be viruses that come from nature no matter how good we treat it but there will be less. 
I also think how we treat our animals and their habitats are a reflection of us as a whole. If we destroy them without much thought then we are more likely to destroy ourselves. The world is a relatively small place. We all share it, the more we protect it the more we protect ourselves. The healthier nature is the healthier we are since are all part of nature. 
So, in conclustion, no,  don't think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, not at all. We all live on the same planet and no matter how much we try to remove ourselves from nature, we are still part of it along with all the animals and other living beings. If our animals are looked well taken care of, humans will benefit from it as well. Both with  healthy meats and strong, healthy bonds between pets. Also, when wild animals are better preserved, they are less likely to get diseased and there would be less of a chance of those diseases making their way into the human population. Of course, this is not always possible. There will be viruses that come from nature no matter how good we treat it but there will be less.

In my opinion, not at all. We all live on the same planet and no matter how much we try to remove ourselves from nature, we are still part of it along with all the animals and other living beings. If our animals are looked well taken care of, humans will benefit from it as well. Both with  healthy meats and strong, healthy bonds between pets. Also, when wild animals are better preserved, they are less likely to get diseased and there would be less of a chance of those diseases making their way into the human population. Of course, this is not always possible. There will be viruses that come from nature no matter how good we treat it but there will be less. 
I also think how we treat our animals and their habitats are a reflection of us as a whole. If we destroy them without much thought then we are more likely to destroy ourselves. The world is a relatively small place. We all share it, the more we protect it the more we protect ourselves. The healthier nature is the healthier we are since are all part of nature.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, not at all. We all live on the same planet and no matter how much we try to remove ourselves from nature, we are still part of it along with all the animals and other living beings. If our animals are looked well taken care of, humans will benefit from it as well. Both with  healthy meats and strong, healthy bonds between pets. Also, when wild animals are better preserved, they are less likely to get diseased and there would be less of a chance of those diseases making their way into the human population. Of course, this is not always possible. There will be viruses that come from nature no matter how good we treat it but there will be less. 
I also think how we treat our animals and their habitats are a reflection of us as a whole. If we destroy them without much thought then we are more likely to destroy ourselves.
