In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned. If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed.

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned. If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends.

If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed.

If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends.

If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends.

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned. If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned. If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends.

If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned. If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should.

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned. If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned. If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends.

 Do you think if you keep up with the news and get involved in politics you can make any real difference? Does this type of awareness effect your life at all in a positive or negative way? The answers are different for each person.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned. If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends. 

o you think that the things that are happening in the news are actually affecting your life or this society in any significant way?
 Do you think if you keep up with the news and get involved in politics you can make any real difference? Does this type of awareness effect your life at all in a positive or negative way? The answers are different for each person. 

My personal answers would be “Yes”, “Nope” and “Yeah”.  My life is being impacted by the fact that our president just spewed overtly racist statements about immigrants. Someone threw rocks threw rocks at the car next to mine with political stickers telling immigrants to go back home. I ended up paying $300 to fix the collateral damage. Our society is impacted by this and will be even more so as the news travels around the world.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned. If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends. 

o you think that the things that are happening in the news are actually affecting your life or this society in any significant way?
 Do you think if you keep up with the news and get involved in politics you can make any real difference? Does this type of awareness effect your life at all in a positive or negative way? The answers are different for each person. 

My personal answers would be “Yes”, “Nope” and “Yeah”.  My life is being impacted by the fact that our president just spewed overtly racist statements about immigrants. Someone threw rocks threw rocks at the car next to mine with political stickers telling immigrants to go back home. I ended up paying $300 to fix the collateral damage. Our society is impacted by this and will be even more so as the news travels around the world.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned. If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends.

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned. If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends. 

o you think that the things that are happening in the news are actually affecting your life or this society in any significant way?
 Do you think if you keep up with the news and get involved in politics you can make any real difference? Does this type of awareness effect your life at all in a positive or negative way? The answers are different for each person. 

My life is being impacted by the fact that our president just spewed overtly racist statements about immigrants. Someone threw rocks threw rocks at the car next to mine with political stickers telling immigrants to go back home. I ended up paying $300 to fix the collateral damage.

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned. If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends. 

o you think that the things that are happening in the news are actually affecting your life or this society in any significant way?
 Do you think if you keep up with the news and get involved in politics you can make any real difference? Does this type of awareness effect your life at all in a positive or negative way? The answers are different for each person. 

My life is being impacted by the fact that our president just spewed overtly racist statements about immigrants. Someone threw rocks threw rocks at the car next to mine with political stickers telling immigrants to go back home. I ended up paying $300 to fix the collateral damage. Our society is impacted by this and will be even more so as the news travels around the world. 

Can I make any real difference? Probably. I can have my opinions and hopes and dreams, but I can't do anything that will effectively change policy in any substantial way. 
What I can do is do things to help me feel like I'm an active participant in the world.
 I talk to strangers when I'm out in public instead of sitting at my table and being an introvert. I try to stay informed about local and state politics. I try to make safe spaces for people of various backgrounds and try to speak up when I see bigotry.

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends.

My life is being impacted by the fact that our president just spewed overtly racist statements about immigrants. Someone threw rocks threw rocks at the car next to mine with political stickers telling immigrants to go back home. I ended up paying $300 to fix the collateral damage.

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned.

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned. If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends.

My life is being impacted by the fact that our president just spewed overtly racist statements about immigrants.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned. If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends. 

o you think that the things that are happening in the news are actually affecting your life or this society in any significant way?
 Do you think if you keep up with the news and get involved in politics you can make any real difference? Does this type of awareness effect your life at all in a positive or negative way? The answers are different for each person. 

My life is being impacted by the fact that our president just spewed overtly racist statements about immigrants. Someone threw rocks threw rocks at the car next to mine with political stickers telling immigrants to go back home. I ended up paying $300 to fix the collateral damage. Our society is impacted by this and will be even more so as the news travels around the world. 

Can I make any real difference? Probably not. I can have my opinions and hopes and dreams, but I likely can't do anything that will effectively change policy in any substantial way. 
What I can do is do things to help me feel like I'm an active participant in the world.
 I talk to strangers when I'm out in public instead of sitting at my table and being an introvert. I try to stay informed about local and state politics. I try to make safe spaces for people of various backgrounds and try to speak up when I see bigotry.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned. If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends. 

o you think that the things that are happening in the news are actually affecting your life or this society in any significant way?
 Do you think if you keep up with the news and get involved in politics you can make any real difference? Does this type of awareness effect your life at all in a positive or negative way? The answers are different for each person. 

My life is being impacted by the fact that our president just spewed overtly racist statements about immigrants. Someone threw rocks threw rocks at the car next to mine with political stickers telling immigrants to go back home. I ended up paying $300 to fix the collateral damage. Our society is impacted by this and will be even more so as the news travels around the world.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned. If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should.

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned. If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends.

 Do you think if you keep up with the news and get involved in politics you can make any real difference? Does this type of awareness effect your life at all in a positive or negative way? The answers are different for each person. 

My life is being impacted by the fact that our president just spewed overtly racist statements about immigrants. Someone threw rocks threw rocks at the car next to mine with political stickers telling immigrants to go back home. I ended up paying $300 to fix the collateral damage.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned.

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned. If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends. 

o you think that the things that are happening in the news are actually affecting your life or this society in any significant way?
 Do you think if you keep up with the news and get involved in politics you can make any real difference? Does this type of awareness effect your life at all in a positive or negative way? The answers are different for each person. 

My life is being impacted by the fact that our president just spewed overtly racist statements about immigrants. Someone threw rocks threw rocks at the car next to mine with political stickers telling immigrants to go back home. I ended up paying $300 to fix the collateral damage. Our society is impacted by this and will be even more so as the news travels around the world. 

Can I make any real difference? Probably not. I can have my opinions and hopes and dreams, but I likely can't do anything that will effectively change policy in any substantial way. 
What I can do is do things to help me feel like I'm an active participant in the world.
 I talk to strangers when I'm out in public instead of sitting at my table and being an introvert. I try to stay informed about local and state politics. I try to make safe spaces for people of various backgrounds and try to speak up when I see bigotry.

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned.

If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends.

 Do you think if you keep up with the news and get involved in politics you can make any real difference? Does this type of awareness effect your life at all in a positive or negative way? The answers are different for each person. 

My life is being impacted by the fact that our president just spewed overtly racist statements about immigrants. Someone threw rocks threw rocks at the car next to mine with political stickers telling immigrants to go back home. I ended up paying $300 to fix the collateral damage. Our society is impacted by this and will be even more so as the news travels around the world. 

Can I make any real difference? Probably not. I can have my opinions and hopes and dreams, but I likely can't do anything that will effectively change policy in any substantial way.

 I talk to strangers when I'm out in public instead of sitting at my table and being an introvert. I try to stay informed about local and state politics. I try to make safe spaces for people of various backgrounds and try to speak up when I see bigotry.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned. If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned. If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should.

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in.

If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends. 

o you think that the things that are happening in the news are actually affecting your life or this society in any significant way?
 Do you think if you keep up with the news and get involved in politics you can make any real difference? Does this type of awareness effect your life at all in a positive or negative way? The answers are different for each person. 

My life is being impacted by the fact that our president just spewed overtly racist statements about immigrants. Someone threw rocks threw rocks at the car next to mine with political stickers telling immigrants to go back home. I ended up paying $300 to fix the collateral damage. Our society is impacted by this and will be even more so as the news travels around the world. 

Can I make any real difference? Probably not. I can have my opinions and hopes and dreams, but I likely can't do anything that will effectively change policy in any substantial way. 
What I can do is do things to help me feel like I'm an active participant in the world.
 I talk to strangers when I'm out in public instead of sitting at my table and being an introvert. I try to stay informed about local and state politics. I try to make safe spaces for people of various backgrounds and try to speak up when I see bigotry. 
I know I can't make any real change and that the world is big and scary and overwhelming, but I like feeling like my words
 and actions are at least a small part of the picture. I feel that I can make a change at local level, and pay attention to the news I see involving my community. But I don't judge those who feel differently. They're not bad, just have a different perspective than I do. ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think that for methere is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned. If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think that for me personalythere is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned. If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends. 

o you think that the things that are happening in the news are actually affecting your life or this society in any significant way?
 Do you think if you keep up with the news and get involved in politics you can make any real difference? Does this type of awareness effect your life at all in a positive or negative way? The answers are different for each person. 

My life is being impacted by the fact that our president just spewed overtly racist statements about immigrants. Someone threw rocks threw rocks at the car next to mine with political stickers telling immigrants to go back home. I ended up paying $300 to fix the collateral damage. Our society is impacted by this and will be even more so as the news travels around the world. 

Can I make any real difference? Probably not. I can have my opinions and hopes and dreams, but I likely can't do anything that will effectively change policy in any substantial way. 
What I can do is do things to help me feel like I'm an active participant in the world.
 I talk to strangers when I'm out in public instead of sitting at my table and being an introvert. I try to stay informed about local and state politics. I try to make safe spaces for people of various backgrounds and try to speak up when I see bigotry. 
I know I can't make any real change and that the world is big and scary and overwhelming, but I like feeling like my words
 and actions are at least a small part of the picture. I feel that I can make a change at local level, and pay attention to the news I see involving my community.
