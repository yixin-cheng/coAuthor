In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads.

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?

With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?

With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage.

With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world.

If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't alway",user,20,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage.

A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives.

I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.

 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage.

With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives.

I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also",user,22,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage.

In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage.

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives.

I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on in",user,22,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For som",user,23,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.

If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information.

I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives.

With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information.

I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information.

As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information.

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have.

I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have. This doesn't make these people any less of a good citizen or responsible person. We all try to do what we can. Simplay",user,26,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have. This doesn't make these people any less of a good citizen or responsible person. We all try to do what we can. Simply stated,",user,26,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives.

A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have. This doesn't make these people any less of a good citizen or responsible person. We all try to do what we can. Simply stated, sometimes trying is the best we can do.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have. This doesn't make these people any less of a good citizen or responsible person. We all try to do what we can. Simply stated, sometimes trying is the best we can do.

A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have. This doesn't make these people any less of a good citizen or responsible person. We all try to do what we can. Simply stated, sometimes trying is the best we can do.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives.

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have. This doesn't make these people any less of a good citizen or responsible person. We all try to do what we can. Simply stated, sometimes trying is the best we can do.

In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have. This doesn't make these people any less of a good citizen or responsible person. We all try to do what we can. Simply stated, sometimes trying is the best we can do.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage.

As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have. This doesn't make these people any less of a good citizen or responsible person. We all try to do what we can. Simply stated, sometimes trying is the best we can do.

I would love to see everyone up to date on world and national events. I understand, however, that this simply isn't a reality for all people. It is more important, to me,",user,29,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.

In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have. This doesn't make these people any less of a good citizen or responsible person. We all try to do what we can. Simply stated, sometimes trying is the best we can do.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have. This doesn't make these people any less of a good citizen or responsible person. We all try to do what we can. Simply stated, sometimes trying is the best we can do.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?

I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have. This doesn't make these people any less of a good citizen or responsible person. We all try to do what we can. Simply stated, sometimes trying is the best we can do.

I would love to see everyone up to date on world and national events. I understand, however, that this simply isn't a reality for all people. It is more important, to me, that the people who produce the news, produce honest",user,29,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

This doesn't make these people any less of a good citizen or responsible person. We all try to do what we can. Simply stated, sometimes trying is the best we can do.

I would love to see everyone up to date on world and national events. I understand, however, that this simply isn't a reality for all people. It is more important, to me, that the people who produce the news, produce honest telecasts. F",user,30,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have.

If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have. This doesn't make these people any less of a good citizen or responsible person. We all try to do what we can. Simply stated, sometimes trying is the best we can do.

I would love to see everyone up to date on world and national events. I understand, however, that this simply isn't a reality for all people. It is more important, to me, that the people who produce the news, produce honest telecasts. From these viewi",user,30,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have. This doesn't make these people any less of a good citizen or responsible person. We all try to do what we can. Simply stated, sometimes trying is the best we can do.

I would love to see everyone up to date on world and national events. I understand, however, that this simply isn't a reality for all people.

With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have. This doesn't make these people any less of a good citizen or responsible person. We all try to do what we can. Simply stated, sometimes trying is the best we can do.

I would love to see everyone up to date on world and national events. I understand, however, that this simply isn't a reality for all people. It is more important, to me, that the people who produce the news, produce honest telecasts. From these viewings and readings, those that partake of",user,30,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have. This doesn't make these people any less of a good citizen or responsible person. We all try to do what we can. Simply stated, sometimes trying is the best we can do.

I would love to see everyone up to date on world and national events. I understand, however, that this simply isn't a reality for all people. It is more important, to me, that the people who produce the news, produce honest telecasts.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have. This doesn't make these people any less of a good citizen or responsible person. We all try to do what we can. Simply stated, sometimes trying is the best we can do.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have. This doesn't make these people any less of a good citizen or responsible person. We all try to do what we can. Simply stated, sometimes trying is the best we can do.

I would love to see everyone up to date on world and national events. I understand, however, that this simply isn't a reality for all people. It is more important, to me, that the people who produce the news, produce honest telecasts.
