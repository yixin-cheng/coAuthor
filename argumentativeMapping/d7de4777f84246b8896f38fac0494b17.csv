In my opinion, people should not be pressured to keep up with the news, nor should they be made to feel inadequate if the don't do so. Ours is not a society like that of ancient Sparta where every male citizen filled the same role, that of soldier. People in our society fill many different roles and take a multitude of different paths in life. 
I think it is a good thing that people are not forced to be informed about the news.
 Some people simply don't have the interest or temperament for news. Should we dictate to every artist and poet that they must be more informed of worldly affairs? Many people make great contributions to society without having any interest in the news at all.   think that people should be free to choose what they want to know about.
 This type of freedom is pivotal to our way of life. We must remember that it is not only freedom of action that we should espouse but, crucially, freedom of thought. Shaming people who don't follow current affairs is simply a form of mental tyranny. It is important for us to allow this spirit of freedom to thrive and not try to dictate the interests of everybody. Of course it's true that the news is important. But it's also true that it is not the only thing that is important. Certainly many people should take an interest in current affairs and the truth is that many are naturally inclined to do so. For those that do not have this inclination, let them go on their own path in freedom.  hhhhgggggddd",user,21,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
