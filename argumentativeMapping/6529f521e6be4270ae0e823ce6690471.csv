Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports. What are we going to watch instead? E-sports? Where ""athletes"" are just sitting on their computer and mouse and keyboard and doing absolutely nothing except for playing a video game? We hear those commentators say things like, ""the character killed about 15 people in one match,"" and we call that a sport? Just give me a break.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports. What are we going to watch instead? E-sports? Where ""athletes"" are just sitting on their computer and mouse and keyboard and doing absolutely nothing except for playing a video game? We hear those commentators say things like, ""the character killed about 15 people in one match,"" and we call that a sport? Just give me a break.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential.

It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports. What are we going to watch instead? E-sports? Where ""athletes"" are just sitting on their computer and mouse and keyboard and doing absolutely nothing except for playing a video game? We hear those commentators say things like, ""the character killed about 15 people in one match,"" and we call that a sport? Just give me a break.

I know I sound a little bit angry, but wouldn't you be? I've read our history books when there were no safety involved and people just went all in, doing whatever they felt like doing. We did not get stories about plain old men dying of chest injuries incurred during sports because the protective chest plates was too heavy to come with them everywhere, or protectors were not available, no. We heard stories of mighty men overcoming their fears and coming out on top. Stori",user,21,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports. What are we going to watch instead? E-sports? Where ""athletes"" are just sitting on their computer and mouse and keyboard and doing absolutely nothing except for playing a video game? We hear those commentators say things like, ""the character killed about 15 people in one match,"" and we call that a sport? Just give me a break.

I know I sound a little bit angry, but wouldn't you be? I've read our history books when there were no safety involved and people just went all in, doing whatever they felt like doing. We did not get stories about plain old men dying of chest injuries incurred during sports because the protective chest plates was too heavy to come with them everywhere, or protectors were not available, no. We heard stories of mighty men overcoming their fears and coming out on top. Stories like those helped shape our culture, and those stories are sometimes what we want to emulate.

We did not get stories about plain old men dying of chest injuries incurred during sports because the protective chest plates was too heavy to come with them everywhere, or protectors were not available, no. We heard stories of mighty men overcoming their fears and coming out on top. Stories like those helped shape our culture, and those stories are sometimes what we want to emulate. Stories of overcoming something despite the odds or because of the odds, that's what makes for a powerful tale. If we stopped trying, if we stopped taking risks or stopped offering them, then aren't we depriving ourselves of knowing what the meaning of challenge really is?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports. What are we going to watch instead? E-sports? Where ""athletes"" are just sitting on their computer and mouse and keyboard and doing absolutely nothing except for playing a video game? We hear those commentators say things like, ""the character killed about 15 people in one match,"" and we call that a sport? Just give me a break.

I know I sound a little bit angry, but wouldn't you be? I've read our history books when there were no safety involved and people just went all in, doing whatever they felt like doing. We did not get stories about plain old men dying of chest injuries incurred during sports because the protective chest plates was too heavy to come with them everywhere, or protectors were not available, no. We heard stories of mighty men overcoming their fears and coming out on top. Stories like those helped shape our culture, and those stories are sometimes what we want to emulate. Stories of overcoming something despite the odds or because of the odds, that's what makes for a powerful tale. If we stopped trying, if we stopped taking risks or stopped offering them, then aren't we depriving ourselves of knowing what the meaning of challenge really is?

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports. What are we going to watch instead? E-sports? Where ""athletes"" are just sitting on their computer and mouse and keyboard and doing absolutely nothing except for playing a video game? We hear those commentators say things like, ""the character killed about 15 people in one match,"" and we call that a sport? Just give me a break.

I know I sound a little bit angry, but wouldn't you be? I've read our history books when there were no safety involved and people just went all in, doing whatever they felt like doing. We did not get stories about plain old men dying of chest injuries incurred during sports because the protective chest plates was too heavy to come with them everywhere, or protectors were not available, no. We heard stories of mighty men overcoming their fears and coming out on top. Stories like those helped shape our culture, and those stories are sometimes what we want to emulate. Stories of overcoming something despite the odds or because of the odds, that's what makes for a powerful tale. If we stopped trying, if we stopped taking risks or stopped offering them, then aren't we depriving ourselves of knowing what the meaning of challenge really is?

If our mentality is focused on safety, we would not have gotten to the moon, we would not have airplanes, we would not have cellphones, and the world would be a pretty boring place because people took it safe. So if you're me, I dare w",user,25,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports. What are we going to watch instead? E-sports? Where ""athletes"" are just sitting on their computer and mouse and keyboard and doing absolutely nothing except for playing a video game? We hear those commentators say things like, ""the character killed about 15 people in one match,"" and we call that a sport? Just give me a break.

I know I sound a little bit angry, but wouldn't you be? I've read our history books when there were no safety involved and people just went all in, doing whatever they felt like doing. We did not get stories about plain old men dying of chest injuries incurred during sports because the protective chest plates was too heavy to come with them everywhere, or protectors were not available, no. We heard stories of mighty men overcoming their fears and coming out on top. Stories like those helped shape our culture, and those stories are sometimes what we want to emulate. Stories of overcoming something despite the odds or because of the odds, that's what makes for a powerful tale. If we stopped trying, if we stopped taking risks or stopped offering them, then aren't we depriving ourselves of knowing what the meaning of challenge really is?

If our mentality is focused on safety, we would not have gotten to the moon, we would not have airplanes, we would not have cellphones, and the world would be a pretty boring place because people took it safe. So if you're me, I dare welcome extrem",user,25,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports. What are we going to watch instead? E-sports? Where ""athletes"" are just sitting on their computer and mouse and keyboard and doing absolutely nothing except for playing a video game? We hear those commentators say things like, ""the character killed about 15 people in one match,"" and we call that a sport? Just give me a break.

I know I sound a little bit angry, but wouldn't you be? I've read our history books when there were no safety involved and people just went all in, doing whatever they felt like doing. We did not get stories about plain old men dying of chest injuries incurred during sports because the protective chest plates was too heavy to come with them everywhere, or protectors were not available, no. We heard stories of mighty men overcoming their fears and coming out on top. Stories like those helped shape our culture, and those stories are sometimes what we want to emulate. Stories of overcoming something despite the odds or because of the odds, that's what makes for a powerful tale. If we stopped trying, if we stopped taking risks or stopped offering them, then aren't we depriving ourselves of knowing what the meaning of challenge really is?

If our mentality is focused on safety, we would not have gotten to the moon, we would not have airplanes, we would not have cellphones, and the world would be a pretty boring place because people took it safe. So if you're me, I dare welcome extreme sports,",user,25,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports. What are we going to watch instead? E-sports? Where ""athletes"" are just sitting on their computer and mouse and keyboard and doing absolutely nothing except for playing a video game? We hear those commentators say things like, ""the character killed about 15 people in one match,"" and we call that a sport? Just give me a break.

I know I sound a little bit angry, but wouldn't you be? I've read our history books when there were no safety involved and people just went all in, doing whatever they felt like doing. We did not get stories about plain old men dying of chest injuries incurred during sports because the protective chest plates was too heavy to come with them everywhere, or protectors were not available, no. We heard stories of mighty men overcoming their fears and coming out on top. Stories like those helped shape our culture, and those stories are sometimes what we want to emulate. Stories of overcoming something despite the odds or because of the odds, that's what makes for a powerful tale. If we stopped trying, if we stopped taking risks or stopped offering them, then aren't we depriving ourselves of knowing what the meaning of challenge really is?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports. What are we going to watch instead? E-sports? Where ""athletes"" are just sitting on their computer and mouse and keyboard and doing absolutely nothing except for playing a video game? We hear those commentators say things like, ""the character killed about 15 people in one match,"" and we call that a sport? Just give me a break.

I know I sound a little bit angry, but wouldn't you be? I've read our history books when there were no safety involved and people just went all in, doing whatever they felt like doing. We did not get stories about plain old men dying of chest injuries incurred during sports because the protective chest plates was too heavy to come with them everywhere, or protectors were not available, no. We heard stories of mighty men overcoming their fears and coming out on top. Stories like those helped shape our culture, and those stories are sometimes what we want to emulate. Stories of overcoming something despite the odds or because of the odds, that's what makes for a powerful tale. If we stopped trying, if we stopped taking risks or stopped offering them, then aren't we depriving ourselves of knowing what the meaning of challenge really is?

If our mentality is focused on safety, we would not have gotten to the moon, we would not have airplanes, we would not have cellphones, and the world would be a pretty boring place because people took it safe. So if you're me, I dare welcome extreme sports, because if we don't, we're going to end up losing a lot in the process.",api,25,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
