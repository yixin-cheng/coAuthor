In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I would not say that we are bad citizens for watching the news. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, but I do not think that it is necessary for everyone to watch the news because my kids do not watch the news, just like normal kids. Does that make them bad citizens? No, it does not. 

It is also in my opinion that it is impossible for adults today to not watch the news at all anyways because the news is everywhere. Even if it is not consumed by traditional TV methods, it is still all over social media, the internet, and even on the radio. As well as that your friends, and co-workers are a source of some form of the news because they spread it via word of mouth, and you watch them when they are talking to you for the most part. 

Even more so, since everyone consumes the news in one way or another, I do not think you can call anyone a bad citizen based on their consumption or lack there of, of current world events.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I would not say that we are bad citizens for watching the news. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, but I do not think that it is necessary for everyone to watch the news because my kids do not watch the news, just like normal kids. Does that make them bad citizens? No, it does not. 

It is also in my opinion that it is impossible for adults today to not watch the news at all anyways because the news is everywhere. Even if it is not consumed by traditional TV methods, it is still all over social media, the internet, and even on the radio. As well as that your friends, and co-workers are a source of some form of the news because they spread it via word of mouth, and you watch them when they are talking to you for the most part. 

Even more so, since everyone consumes the news in one way or another, I do not think you can call anyone a bad citizen based on their consumption or lack there of, of current world events.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I would not say that we are bad citizens for watching the news. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, but I do not think that it is necessary for everyone to watch the news because my kids do not watch the news, just like normal kids. Does that make them bad citizens? No, it does not. 

It is also in my opinion that it is impossible for adults today to not watch the news at all anyways because the news is everywhere. Even if it is not consumed by traditional TV methods, it is still all over social media, the internet, and even on the radio. As well as that your friends, and co-workers are a source of some form of the news because they spread it via word of mouth, and you watch them when they are talking to you for the most part. 

Even more so, since everyone consumes the news in one way or another, I do not think you can call anyone a bad citizen based on their consumption or lack there of, of current world events.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I would not say that we are bad citizens for watching the news. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, but I do not think that it is necessary for everyone to watch the news because my kids do not watch the news, just like normal kids. Does that make them bad citizens? No, it does not. 

It is also in my opinion that it is impossible for adults today to not watch the news at all anyways because the news is everywhere. Even if it is not consumed by traditional TV methods, it is still all over social media, the internet, and even on the radio. As well as that your friends, and co-workers are a source of some form of the news because they spread it via word of mouth, and you watch them when they are talking to you for the most part. 

Even more so, since everyone consumes the news in one way or another, I do not think you can call anyone a bad citizen based on their consumption or lack there of, of current world events.
I do think that most people only keep up on the news that they themselves, or those around them, would be at all remotely interested in. For example, I do not think that a person who is not a sports fan would keep up with the news about sports. Someone who is not interested in what's going on in, let's say Italy, is going to watch the news about Italian affairs like someone from that area would.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I would not say that we are bad citizens for watching the news. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, but I do not think that it is necessary for everyone to watch the news because my kids do not watch the news, just like normal kids. Does that make them bad citizens? No, it does not. 

It is also in my opinion that it is impossible for adults today to not watch the news at all anyways because the news is everywhere. Even if it is not consumed by traditional TV methods, it is still all over social media, the internet, and even on the radio. As well as that your friends, and co-workers are a source of some form of the news because they spread it via word of mouth, and you watch them when they are talking to you for the most part. 

Even more so, since everyone consumes the news in one way or another, I do not think you can call anyone a bad citizen based on their consumption or lack there of, of current world events.
I do think that most people only keep up on the news that they themselves, or those around them, would be at all remotely interested in. For example, I do not think that a person who is not a sports fan would keep up with the news about sports. Someone who is not interested in what's going on in, let's say Italy, is going to watch the news about Italian affairs like someone from that area would.

In my opinion, I would not say that we are bad citizens for watching the news. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, but I do not think that it is necessary for everyone to watch the news because my kids do not watch the news, just like normal kids. Does that make them bad citizens? No, it does not. 

It is also in my opinion that it is impossible for adults today to not watch the news at all anyways because the news is everywhere. Even if it is not consumed by traditional TV methods, it is still all over social media, the internet, and even on the radio. As well as that your friends, and co-workers are a source of some form of the news because they spread it via word of mouth, and you watch them when they are talking to you for the most part. 

Even more so, since everyone consumes the news in one way or another, I do not think you can call anyone a bad citizen based on their consumption or lack there of, of current world events.
I do think that most people only keep up on the news that they themselves, or those around them, would be at all remotely interested in. For example, I do not think that a person who is not a sports fan would keep up with the news about sports. Someone who is not interested in what's going on in, let's say Italy, is going to watch the news about Italian affairs like someone from that area would.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?
