In my opinion, we should opt for a balance. We should use screens if they help reduce danger of catching Delta Covid. We also need to maintain relationships in real life. While screens did, indeed win, we need to involve ourselves with others in real life. We need to give hugs when it's safe to do so, visit people see them in actuality. We need to keep close connections. Removing ourselves from others damages us. It prevents us from deepening our relationships and cementing our life.
We need to be aware of the dangers of screen time.
 We need to monitor our usage and do what we can to avoid becoming addicted to screens. We need to maintain a strong self control with avoiding being pulled in with gaming, too much texting, and avoiding real events, if it's safe to meet in person. When people invite you over, if it's safe to go, say yes. Take care to change one activity each day. Maintain close friendships, don't neglect to go for a meal with someone, host a game night, or do something fun. Make a sort of game of it.

Maintain close friendships, don't neglect to go for a meal with someone, host a game night, or do something fun. Make a sort of game of it. 


If you're feeling isolated, try to get out and about.
 Do something fun, encourage someone who you see in person. While outside, introduce yourself. Make a new friend, in real life. Avoid sitting home alone in the dark. It's a bad sign that you are so focused on a small screen and can't determine what's happening near you. When you are outside try to avoid listening full time to blasting music. Listen to birds, hear your neighbors say hello. Make things more real. Make your life real. Shun the virtual if you can. Do screen free time at work or at home.  For goodness sake if you meet someone or are at work and in a meeting, turn OFF your devices. Be wholly present. 
If you have a child, monitor their screen time.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should opt for a balance. We should use screens if they help reduce danger of catching Delta Covid. We also need to maintain relationships in real life. While screens did, indeed win, we need to involve ourselves with others in real life. We need to give hugs when it's safe to do so, visit people see them in actuality. We need to keep close connections. Removing ourselves from others damages us. It prevents us from deepening our relationships and cementing our life.
We need to be aware of the dangers of screen time.
 We need to monitor our usage and do what we can to avoid becoming addicted to screens. We need to maintain a strong self control with avoiding being pulled in with gaming, too much texting, and avoiding real events, if it's safe to meet in person. When people invite you over, if it's safe to go, say yes. Take care to change one activity each day. Maintain close friendships, don't neglect to go for a meal with someone, host a game night, or do something fun. Make a sort of game of it. 


If you're feeling isolated, try to get out and about.
 Do something fun, encourage someone who you see in person. While outside, introduce yourself. Make a new friend, in real life. Avoid sitting home alone in the dark. It's a bad sign that you are so focused on a small screen and can't determine what's happening near you. When you are outside try to avoid listening full time to blasting music. Listen to birds, hear your neighbors say hello. Make things more real. Make your life real. Shun the virtual if you can. Do screen free time at work or at home.  For goodness sake if you meet someone or are at work and in a meeting, turn OFF your devices. Be wholly present. 
If you have a child, monitor their screen time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should opt for a balance. We should use screens if they help reduce danger of catching Delta Covid. We also need to maintain relationships in real life. While screens did, indeed win, we need to involve ourselves with others in real life. We need to give hugs when it's safe to do so, visit people see them in actuality. We need to keep close connections. Removing ourselves from others damages us. It prevents us from deepening our relationships and cementing our life.
We need to be aware of the dangers of screen time.
 We need to monitor our usage and do what we can to avoid becoming addicted to screens. We need to maintain a strong self control with avoiding being pulled in with gaming, too much texting, and avoiding real events, if it's safe to meet in person. When people invite you over, if it's safe to go, say yes. Take care to change one activity each day. Maintain close friendships, don't neglect to go for a meal with someone, host a game night, or do something fun. Make a sort of game of it. 


If you're feeling isolated, try to get out and about.
 Do something fun, encourage someone who you see in person. While outside, introduce yourself. Make a new friend, in real life. Avoid sitting home alone in the dark. It's a bad sign that you are so focused on a small screen and can't determine what's happening near you. When you are outside try to avoid listening full time to blasting music. Listen to birds, hear your neighbors say hello. Make things more real. Make your life real. Shun the virtual if you can. Do screen free time at work or at home.  For goodness sake if you meet someone or are at work and in a meeting, turn OFF your devices. Be wholly present. 
If you have a child, monitor their screen time.

In my opinion, we should opt for a balance. We should use screens if they help reduce danger of catching Delta Covid. We also need to maintain relationships in real life. While screens did, indeed win, we need to involve ourselves with others in real life. We need to give hugs when it's safe to do so, visit people see them in actuality. We need to keep close connections. Removing ourselves from others damages us. It prevents us from deepening our relationships and cementing our life.
We need to be aware of the dangers of screen time.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should opt for a balance. We should use screens if they help reduce danger of catching Delta Covid. We also need to maintain relationships in real life. While screens did, indeed win, we need to involve ourselves with others in real life. We need to give hugs when it's safe to do so, visit people see them in actuality. We need to keep close connections. Removing ourselves from others damages us. It prevents us from deepening our relationships and cementing our life.
We need to be aware of the dangers of screen time.
 We need to monitor our usage and do what we can to avoid becoming addicted to screens. We need to maintain a strong self control with avoiding being pulled in with gaming, too much texting, and avoiding real events, if it's safe to meet in person. When people invite you over, if it's safe to go, say yes. Take care to change one activity each day. Maintain close friendships, don't neglect to go for a meal with someone, host a game night, or do something fun. Make a sort of game of it. 


If you're feeling isolated, try to get out and about.
 Do something fun, encourage someone who you see in person. While outside, introduce yourself. Make a new friend, in real life. Avoid sitting home alone in the dark. It's a bad sign that you are so focused on a small screen and can't determine what's happening near you. When you are outside try to avoid listening full time to blasting music. Listen to birds, hear your neighbors say hello. Make things more real. Make your life real. Shun the virtual if you can. Do screen free time at work or at home.  For goodness sake if you meet someone or are at work and in a meeting, turn OFF your devices. Be wholly present. 
If you have a child, monitor their screen time.

In my opinion, we should opt for a balance. We should use screens if they help reduce danger of catching Delta Covid. We also need to maintain relationships in real life. While screens did, indeed win, we need to involve ourselves with others in real life. We need to give hugs when it's safe to do so, visit people see them in actuality. We need to keep close connections. Removing ourselves from others damages us. It prevents us from deepening our relationships and cementing our life.
We need to be aware of the dangers of screen time.
 We need to monitor our usage and do what we can to avoid becoming addicted to screens. We need to maintain a strong self control with avoiding being pulled in with gaming, too much texting, and avoiding real events, if it's safe to meet in person. When people invite you over, if it's safe to go, say yes. Take care to change one activity each day. Maintain close friendships, don't neglect to go for a meal with someone, host a game night, or do something fun. Make a sort of game of it. 


If you're feeling isolated, try to get out and about.
 Do something fun, encourage someone who you see in person. While outside, introduce yourself. Make a new friend, in real life. Avoid sitting home alone in the dark. It's a bad sign that you are so focused on a small screen and can't determine what's happening near you. When you are outside try to avoid listening full time to blasting music. Listen to birds, hear your neighbors say hello. Make things more real. Make your life real. Shun the virtual if you can. Do screen free time at work or at home.  For goodness sake if you meet someone or are at work and in a meeting, turn OFF your devices. Be wholly present. 
If you have a child, monitor their screen time.
 Try to be positive and bring about change. It will help your emotional health, the health, emotionally of your family, and your friends.  M",user,37,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should opt for a balance. We should use screens if they help reduce danger of catching Delta Covid. We also need to maintain relationships in real life. While screens did, indeed win, we need to involve ourselves with others in real life. We need to give hugs when it's safe to do so, visit people see them in actuality. We need to keep close connections. Removing ourselves from others damages us. It prevents us from deepening our relationships and cementing our life.
We need to be aware of the dangers of screen time.
 We need to monitor our usage and do what we can to avoid becoming addicted to screens. We need to maintain a strong self control with avoiding being pulled in with gaming, too much texting, and avoiding real events, if it's safe to meet in person. When people invite you over, if it's safe to go, say yes. Take care to change one activity each day. Maintain close friendships, don't neglect to go for a meal with someone, host a game night, or do something fun. Make a sort of game of it. 


If you're feeling isolated, try to get out and about.
 Do something fun, encourage someone who you see in person. While outside, introduce yourself. Make a new friend, in real life. Avoid sitting home alone in the dark. It's a bad sign that you are so focused on a small screen and can't determine what's happening near you. When you are outside try to avoid listening full time to blasting music. Listen to birds, hear your neighbors say hello. Make things more real. Make your life real. Shun the virtual if you can. Do screen free time at work or at home.  For goodness sake if you meet someone or are at work and in a meeting, turn OFF your devices. Be wholly present. 
If you have a child, monitor their screen time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should opt for a balance. We should use screens if they help reduce danger of catching Delta Covid. We also need to maintain relationships in real life. While screens did, indeed win, we need to involve ourselves with others in real life. We need to give hugs when it's safe to do so, visit people see them in actuality. We need to keep close connections. Removing ourselves from others damages us. It prevents us from deepening our relationships and cementing our life.
We need to be aware of the dangers of screen time.
 We need to monitor our usage and do what we can to avoid becoming addicted to screens. We need to maintain a strong self control with avoiding being pulled in with gaming, too much texting, and avoiding real events, if it's safe to meet in person. When people invite you over, if it's safe to go, say yes. Take care to change one activity each day. Maintain close friendships, don't neglect to go for a meal with someone, host a game night, or do something fun. Make a sort of game of it. 


If you're feeling isolated, try to get out and about.
 Do something fun, encourage someone who you see in person. While outside, introduce yourself. Make a new friend, in real life. Avoid sitting home alone in the dark. It's a bad sign that you are so focused on a small screen and can't determine what's happening near you. When you are outside try to avoid listening full time to blasting music. Listen to birds, hear your neighbors say hello. Make things more real. Make your life real. Shun the virtual if you can. Do screen free time at work or at home.  For goodness sake if you meet someone or are at work and in a meeting, turn OFF your devices. Be wholly present.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should opt for a balance. We should use screens if they help reduce danger of catching Delta Covid. We also need to maintain relationships in real life. While screens did, indeed win, we need to involve ourselves with others in real life. We need to give hugs when it's safe to do so, visit people see them in actuality. We need to keep close connections. Removing ourselves from others damages us. It prevents us from deepening our relationships and cementing our life.
We need to be aware of the dangers of screen time.
 We need to monitor our usage and do what we can to avoid becoming addicted to screens. We need to maintain a strong self control with avoiding being pulled in with gaming, too much texting, and avoiding real events, if it's safe to meet in person. When people invite you over, if it's safe to go, say yes. Take care to change one activity each day. Maintain close friendships, don't neglect to go for a meal with someone, host a game night, or do something fun. Make a sort of game of it. 


If you're feeling isolated, try to get out and about.
 Do something fun, encourage someone who you see in person. While outside, introduce yourself. Make a new friend, in real life. Avoid sitting home alone in the dark. It's a bad sign that you are so focused on a small screen and can't determine what's happening near you. When you are outside try to avoid listening full time to blasting music. Listen to birds, hear your neighbors say hello. Make things more real. Make your life real. Shun the virtual if you can. Do screen free time at work or at home.  For goodness sake if you meet someone or are at work and in a meeting, turn OFF your devices. Be wholly present. 
If you have a child, monitor their screen time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we should opt for a balance. We should use screens if they help reduce danger of catching Delta Covid. We also need to maintain relationships in real life. While screens did, indeed win, we need to involve ourselves with others in real life. We need to give hugs when it's safe to do so, visit people see them in actuality. We need to keep close connections. Removing ourselves from others damages us. It prevents us from deepening our relationships and cementing our life.
We need to be aware of the dangers of screen time.
 We need to monitor our usage and do what we can to avoid becoming addicted to screens. We need to maintain a strong self control with avoiding being pulled in with gaming, too much texting, and avoiding real events, if it's safe to meet in person. When people invite you over, if it's safe to go, say yes. Take care to change one activity each day. Maintain close friendships, don't neglect to go for a meal with someone, host a game night, or do something fun. Make a sort of game of it. 


If you're feeling isolated, try to get out and about.
 Do something fun, encourage someone who you see in person. While outside, introduce yourself. Make a new friend, in real life. Avoid sitting home alone in the dark. It's a bad sign that you are so focused on a small screen and can't determine what's happening near you. When you are outside try to avoid listening full time to blasting music. Listen to birds, hear your neighbors say hello. Make things more real. Make your life real. Shun the virtual if you can. Do screen free time at work or at home.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should opt for a balance. We should use screens if they help reduce danger of catching Delta Covid. We also need to maintain relationships in real life. While screens did, indeed win, we need to involve ourselves with others in real life. We need to give hugs when it's safe to do so, visit people see them in actuality. We need to keep close connections. Removing ourselves from others damages us. It prevents us from deepening our relationships and cementing our life.
We need to be aware of the dangers of screen time.
 We need to monitor our usage and do what we can to avoid becoming addicted to screens. We need to maintain a strong self control with avoiding being pulled in with gaming, too much texting, and avoiding real events, if it's safe to meet in person. When people invite you over, if it's safe to go, say yes. Take care to change one activity each day.

If you're feeling isolated, try to get out and about.
 Do something fun, encourage someone who you see in person. While outside, introduce yourself. Make a new friend, in real life. Avoid sitting home alone in the dark. It's a bad sign that you are so focused on a small screen and can't determine what's happening near you. When you are outside try to avoid listening full time to blasting music. Listen to birds, hear your neighbors say hello. Make things more real. Make your life real. Shun the virtual if you can. Do screen free time at work or at home.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should opt for a balance. We should use screens if they help reduce danger of catching Delta Covid. We also need to maintain relationships in real life. While screens did, indeed win, we need to involve ourselves with others in real life. We need to give hugs when it's safe to do so, visit people see them in actuality. We need to keep close connections. Removing ourselves from others damages us. It prevents us from deepening our relationships and cementing our life.
We need to be aware of the dangers of screen time.
 We need to monitor our usage and do what we can to avoid becoming addicted to screens. We need to maintain a strong self control with avoiding being pulled in with gaming, too much texting, and avoiding real events, if it's safe to meet in person. When people invite you over, if it's safe to go, say yes. Take care to change one activity each day. Maintain close friendships, don't neglect to go for a meal with someone, host a game night, or do something fun. Make a sort of game of it. 


If you're feeling isolated, try to get out and about.
 Do something fun, encourage someone who you see in person. While outside, introduce yourself. Make a new friend, in real life. Avoid sitting home alone in the dark. It's a bad sign that you are so focused on a small screen and can't determine what's happening near you. When you are outside try to avoid listening full time to blasting music. Listen to birds, hear your neighbors say hello. Make things more real. Make your life real. Shun the virtual if you can. Do screen free time at work or at home.  For goodness sake if you meet someone or are at work and in a meeting, turn OFF your devices. Be wholly present. 
If you have a child, monitor their screen time.
