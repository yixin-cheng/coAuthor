In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. To do so would serve to commercialize college sports and the value of a college education. Players on scholaare offered free room and board, so a scholarship is essentially payment for their physical and mental commitment to the team and school. 

If they want an education, they attend college. If they want to focus on sports full time, they can go pro. If they want both, they can find the suitable balance. 

 believe the essential point is that college is not a job.
  The goal of education is to offer an environment where students are exposed to and encouraged to pursue interests and viewpoints that aren’t necessarily personally beneficial. 
By paying athletes, the college experience would be cheapened.
  The value of a degree would drop, as graduates would essentially be viewed as professionals fulfilling their contractual obligation to the university (paying tuition and sitting through lectures). 

The rest of the student body, the non-athletes, while still receiving scholarship money, would be expected to earn an actual living in the ‘real world'.  This would be troublesome from many aspects.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. To do so would serve to commercialize college sports and the value of a college education. Players on scholarship are offered free room and board, so a scholarship is essentially payment for their physical and mental commitment to the team and school. 

If they want an education, they attend college. If they want to focus on sports full time, they can go pro. If they want both, they can find the suitable balance. 

 believe the essential point is that college is not a job.
  The goal of education is to offer an environment where students are exposed to and encouraged to pursue interests and viewpoints that aren’t necessarily personally beneficial. College is the fine-tuning of your skills, the exposure to new ideabefore you begin the commitments and worries of life as a complete adult. 
By paying athletes, the college experience would be cheapened.
  The value of a degree would drop, as graduates would essentially be viewed as professionals fulfilling their contractual obligation to the university (paying tuition and sitting through lectures). 

The rest of the student body, the non-athletes, while still receiving scholarship money, would be expected to earn an actual living in the ‘real world'.  This would be troublesome from many aspects.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. To do so would serve to commercialize college sports and the value of a college education. Players on scholarship are offered free room and board, so a scholarship is essentially payment for their physical and mental commitment to the team and school. 

If they want an education, they attend college. If they want to focus on sports full time, they can go pro. If they want both, they can find the suitable balance. 

 believe the essential point is that college is not a job.
  The goal of education is to offer an environment where students are exposed to and encouraged to pursue interests and viewpoints that aren’t necessarily personally beneficial. College is the fine-tuning of your skills, the exposure to new ideas, before you begin the commitments and worries of life as a complete adult. 
By paying athletes, the college experience would be cheapened.
  The value of a degree would drop, as graduates would essentially be viewed as professionals fulfilling their contractual obligation to the university (paying tuition and sitting through lectures). 

The rest of the student body, the non-athletes, while still receiving scholarship money, would be expected to earn an actual living in the ‘real world'.  This would be troublesome from many aspects.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. To do so would serve to commercialize college sports and the value of a college education. Players on scholarship are offered free room and board, so a scholarship is essentially payment for their physical and mental commitment to the team and school. 

If they want an education, they attend college. If they want to focus on sports full time, they can go pro. If they want both, they can find the suitable balance. 

 believe the essential point is that college is not a job.
  The goal of education is to offer an environment where students are exposed to and encouraged to pursue interests and viewpoints that aren’t necessarily personally beneficial. College is the fine-tuning of your skills, the exposure to new ideas, before you begin the commitments and worries of life as a complete adult. 
By paying athletes, the college experience would be cheapened.
  The value of a degree would drop, as graduates would essentially be viewed as professionals fulfilling their contractual obligation to the university (paying tuition and sitting through lectures). 

The rest of the student body, the non-athletes, while still receiving scholarship money, would be expected to earn an actual living in the ‘real world'.  This would be troublesome from many aspects.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. To do so would serve to commercialize college sports and the value of a college education. Players on scholarship are offered free room and board, so a scholarship is essentially payment for their physical and mental commitment to the team and school. 

If they want an education, they attend college. If they want to focus on sports full time, they can go pro. If they want both, they can find the suitable balance. 

 believe the essential point is that college is not a job.
  The goal of education is to offer an environment where students are exposed to and encouraged to pursue interests and viewpoints that aren’t necessarily personally beneficial. College is the fine-tuning of your skills, the exposure to new ideas, before you begin the commitments and worries of life as a complete adult. 
By paying athletes, the college experience would be cheapened.
  The value of a degree would drop, as graduates would essentially be viewed as professionals fulfilling their contractual obligation to the university (paying tuition and sitting through lectures). 

The rest of the student body, the non-athletes, while still receiving scholarship money, would be expected to earn an actual living in the ‘real world'.  This would be troublesome from many aspects. 

hose who don’t have a chance to play professionally are essentially cheated of this opportunity. to both ""earn and learn"" simultaneously.
