In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is an obligation of each person in a democracy.  Not just the political news either.  We have a responsibility to know what is going on in our communities and the rest of the world. In an ideal situation, we would all be actively contributing to the betterment of our countries and globally. 

The reason I think this is because only when everyone is engaged, can we feel a real positive change.  We all have a responsibility to each other and unless we are aware of what is happening we cannot fulfill that responsibility.

Sure you can stick your head in the sand and care only about yourself and your circumstances and then complain if things aren't the way you like them but you then have nobody to blame but yourself.  Only by participating can we find solutions and prevent problems.  The idea that people on an individual level have no power is nonsense and nothing demonstrates that better than the last U.S. presidential election.  hen I think of the power behind people coming together, I think of this:.

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is an obligation of each person in a democracy.  Not just the political news either.  We have a responsibility to know what is going on in our communities and the rest of the world. In an ideal situation, we would all be actively contributing to the betterment of our countries and globally. 

The reason I think this is because only when everyone is engaged, can we feel a real positive change.  We all have a responsibility to each other and unless we are aware of what is happening we cannot fulfill that responsibility.
