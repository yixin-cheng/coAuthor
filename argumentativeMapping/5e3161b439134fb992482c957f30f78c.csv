In my opinion, keeping up with the news is an obligation of each person in a democracy.  Not just the political news either.  We have a responsibility to know what is going on in our communities and the rest of the world. In an ideal situation, we would all be actively contributing to the betterment of our countries and globally.

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is an obligation of each person in a democracy.  Not just the political news either.  We have a responsibility to know what is going on in our communities and the rest of the world. In an ideal situation, we would all be actively contributing to the betterment of our countries and globally.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is an obligation of each person in a democracy.  Not just the political news either.  We have a responsibility to know what is going on in our communities and the rest of the world.

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is an obligation of each person in a democracy.  Not just the political news either.  We have a responsibility to know what is going on in our communities and the rest of the world. In an ideal situation, we would all be actively contributing to the betterment of our countries and globally.
