I do personally watch the news, but hey lets be honest here. I have myself thought about giving up watching the news, or at least being far more selective about what news I do watch. A few times it does feel like the news will depress me all day, because everything seems so broken now. It doesn't seem the same as the news my parents used to watch. There doesn't really seem to be any unbias news channels out there anymore. It's all political agendas, and most will try to manipulate you into agreeing with them, or call you stupid if you don't agree with them.

I feel like the news no longer paints us as Americans, but instead as democrats, republicans, or to cowardly to choose a side.

I do personally watch the news, but hey lets be honest here. I have myself thought about giving up watching the news, or at least being far more selective about what news I do watch. A few times it does feel like the news will depress me all day, because everything seems so broken now. It doesn't seem the same as the news my parents used to watch.

It's all political agendas, and most will try to manipulate you into agreeing with them, or call you stupid if you don't agree with them.

I feel like the news no longer paints us as Americans, but instead as democrats, republicans, or to cowardly to choose a side. I'm not sure how we can move forward until we can get people to stop hating each other, and remember that we are all from the same place.
