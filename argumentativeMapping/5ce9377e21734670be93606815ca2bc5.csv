Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there are sports that are so extreme they are too dangerous to be called a sport.  They should not be encouraged, indeed, some should be banned.  

There has to be a measure between the benefit received and the risk taken.  The benefits can be in the form of personal gratification, the advancement of the skills acquired that advance society, the advancement of knowledge, etc.  The risks can be in the form of costs to society to give medical treatment or sustain life after an accident, the loss of life, etc.  If the benefits are not worth the risks, then the sport should be banned.

In my opinion, there are sports that are so extreme they are too dangerous to be called a sport.  They should not be encouraged, indeed, some should be banned.  

There has to be a measure between the benefit received and the risk taken.  The benefits can be in the form of personal gratification, the advancement of the skills acquired that advance society, the advancement of knowledge, etc.  The risks can be in the form of costs to society to give medical treatment or sustain life after an accident, the loss of life, etc.  If the benefits are not worth the risks, then the sport should be banned.

Just as the government has mandated the use of seatbelts, helmets for motorcycle riding, and outlawing the scaling of urban buildings they can and should step in to regulate extreme sports.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, there are sports that are so extreme they are too dangerous to be called a sport.  They should not be encouraged, indeed, some should be banned.  

There has to be a measure between the benefit received and the risk taken.  The benefits can be in the form of personal gratification, the advancement of the skills acquired that advance society, the advancement of knowledge, etc.  The risks can be in the form of costs to society to give medical treatment or sustain life after an accident, the loss of life, etc.  If the benefits are not worth the risks, then the sport should be banned.

Just as the government has mandated the use of seatbelts, helmets for motorcycle riding, and outlawing the scaling of urban buildings they can and should step in to regulate extreme sports.  They should also make certain the media, once these are banned, does not report and glorify the participants.

In my opinion, there are sports that are so extreme they are too dangerous to be called a sport.  They should not be encouraged, indeed, some should be banned.  

There has to be a measure between the benefit received and the risk taken.  The benefits can be in the form of personal gratification, the advancement of the skills acquired that advance society, the advancement of knowledge, etc.  The risks can be in the form of costs to society to give medical treatment or sustain life after an accident, the loss of life, etc.  If the benefits are not worth the risks, then the sport should be banned.

They should also make certain the media, once these are banned, does not report and glorify the participants.
