My opinion is that listening to an audiobook can be useful, but reading a book is a much better way. Reading can be relaxing and self-paced. You don’t need to pay attention all the time and read anything you want. Reading makes your brain smarter too. It is possible you always have access to a book but you do not always have  a device with audiobooks in it. To conclude,  I prefer reading to listening to audiobooks.
