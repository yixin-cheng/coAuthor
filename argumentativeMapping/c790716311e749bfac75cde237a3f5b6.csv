And although connecting through devices can help us feel more connected, if kids are using them to play games and use them as an escape for too many extended periods, it seems like it could have the opposite effect and increase isolation over time due to less social activity.

In my opinion, we should be concerned about the excessive screen time that has taken place over the pandemic. Although it has been necessary because of the situation, I know that too much time staring at a screen can have negative effects on someone's health. For one, too much screen time can hurt a persons ability to fall asleep at night.  know that I have been having trouble falling asleep at night because of the amount of time I spend on my computer., especially if I'm working too late. And although connecting through devices can help us feel more connected, if kids are using them to play games and use them as an escape for too many extended periods, it seems like it could have the opposite effect and increase isolation over time due to less social activity. 
Another reason I think we should be concerned about excessive screen time is because it can cause eye strain. Straining our eyes for many hours a day can cause headaches and other issues.
