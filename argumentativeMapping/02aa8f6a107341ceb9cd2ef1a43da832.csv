In my opinion, technology helps you initially find a relationship but then it can sabotage it after.  think it's great to use technology to find a relationship.
 I personally found my partner that way so I know it works. But once you're in a relationship, I think it's important to put the phone down and focus on your partner. That's a problem that many relationships face. People use technology to find their love but then they can't put their phone down to basically nurture the very thing they were wanting. I feel that technology can be addictive so people don't feel satisfied even upon finding love which may have been their ultimate goal in the first place. 

Our reliance in technology isn't going anywhere. We may as well embrace it to help us find love, especially right now during these difficult times. I think it's a great way to meet someone and it can be a great way to keep in touch with your partner. If you happen to both be busy or be in a long term relationship then technology is crucial to keep it going. I think it's important to have a balance though. Know when to put the phone down and know when to disconnect and focus on your partner.
