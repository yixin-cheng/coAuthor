Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.
Technology has also made it easier to communicate.


But this ease of communication comes with a cost.
It's easy to send a message, but it's hard to know if the other person is interested.
 It's easier to lie. It is easier to be too casual about relationships. In the feed of potential partner after potential partner, faces can become a blur. Partners can be more interchangeable too. The phrase ""there are more fish in the sea"" has become more true than ever!

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

A chance invitation, lucky coincidence and happenstance ruled the day. For every million compatible partners you'd be lucky to meet one. Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

A chance invitation, lucky coincidence and happenstance ruled the day. For every million compatible partners you'd be lucky to meet one. Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has made dating and relationships better. In the past, in order to meet the ""right person"" you have to be almost preternaturally lucky. A chance invitation, lucky coincidence and happenstance ruled the day. For every million compatible partners you'd be lucky to meet one. Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.

But this ease of communication comes with a cost.
It's easy to send a message, but it's hard to know if the other person is interested.
 It's easier to lie. It is easier to be too casual about relationships. In the feed of potential partner after potential partner, faces can become a blur. Partners can be more interchangeable too. The phrase ""there are more fish in the sea"" has become more true than ever!

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has made dating and relationships better. In the past, in order to meet the ""right person"" you have to be almost preternaturally lucky. A chance invitation, lucky coincidence and happenstance ruled the day. For every million compatible partners you'd be lucky to meet one. Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.
Technology has also made it easier to communicate.


But this ease of communication comes with a cost.
It's easy to send a message, but it's hard to know if the other person is interested.
 It's easier to lie. It is easier to be too casual about relationships. In the feed of potential partner after potential partner, faces can become a blur. Partners can be more interchangeable too. The phrase ""there are more fish in the sea"" has become more true than ever!
Technology has also made it easier to cheat., as well
 There is precious little independent verification, in most dating apps, of the personal details and photos posted by members. Is the photo accurate? Was it taken in he last year? Is it even a photo of the person who posted it? Are the personal details even remotely accurate. In real life, maybe 15% of the people you meet are fit and trim. On the apps, its well night 90% if not more!

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has made dating and relationships better. In the past, in order to meet the ""right person"" you have to be almost preternaturally lucky. A chance invitation, lucky coincidence and happenstance ruled the day. For every million compatible partners you'd be lucky to meet one. Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.
Technology has also made it easier to communicate.


But this ease of communication comes with a cost.
It's easy to send a message, but it's hard to know if the other person is interested.
 It's easier to lie. It is easier to be too casual about relationships. In the feed of potential partner after potential partner, faces can become a blur. Partners can be more interchangeable too. The phrase ""there are more fish in the sea"" has become more true than ever!
Technology has also made it easier to cheat., as well
 There is precious little independent verification, in most dating apps, of the personal details and photos posted by members. Is the photo accurate? Was it taken in he last year? Is it even a photo of the person who posted it? Are the personal details even remotely accurate. In real life, maybe 15% of the people you meet are fit and trim.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has made dating and relationships better. In the past, in order to meet the ""right person"" you have to be almost preternaturally lucky. A chance invitation, lucky coincidence and happenstance ruled the day. For every million compatible partners you'd be lucky to meet one. Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has made dating and relationships better. In the past, in order to meet the ""right person"" you have to be almost preternaturally lucky. A chance invitation, lucky coincidence and happenstance ruled the day. For every million compatible partners you'd be lucky to meet one. Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.
Technology has also made it easier to communicate.


But this ease of communication comes with a cost.
It's easy to send a message, but it's hard to know if the other person is interested.
 It's easier to lie. It is easier to be too casual about relationships. In the feed of potential partner after potential partner, faces can become a blur. Partners can be more interchangeable too. The phrase ""there are more fish in the sea"" has become more true than ever!
Technology has also made it easier to cheat., as well
 There is precious little independent verification, in most dating apps, of the personal details and photos posted by members. Is the photo accurate? Was it taken in he last year? Is it even a photo of the person who posted it? Are the personal details even remotely accurate. In real life, maybe 15% of the people you meet are fit and trim.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

A chance invitation, lucky coincidence and happenstance ruled the day. For every million compatible partners you'd be lucky to meet one. Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.

It's easy to send a message, but it's hard to know if the other person is interested.
 It's easier to lie. It is easier to be too casual about relationships. In the feed of potential partner after potential partner, faces can become a blur. Partners can be more interchangeable too. The phrase ""there are more fish in the sea"" has become more true than ever!

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has made dating and relationships better. In the past, in order to meet the ""right person"" you have to be almost preternaturally lucky. A chance invitation, lucky coincidence and happenstance ruled the day. For every million compatible partners you'd be lucky to meet one. Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.
Technology has also made it easier to communicate.


But this ease of communication comes with a cost.
It's easy to send a message, but it's hard to know if the other person is interested.
 It's easier to lie. It is easier to be too casual about relationships. In the feed of potential partner after potential partner, faces can become a blur. Partners can be more interchangeable too. The phrase ""there are more fish in the sea"" has become more true than ever!
Technology has also made it easier to cheat., as well
 There is precious little independent verification, in most dating apps, of the personal details and photos posted by members. Is the photo accurate? Was it taken in he last year? Is it even a photo of the person who posted it? Are the personal details even remotely accurate. In real life, maybe 15% of the people you meet are fit and trim. On the apps, its well night 90% if not more!

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

A chance invitation, lucky coincidence, and happenstance ruled the day. For every million compatible partners, you'd be lucky to meet one. Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.
