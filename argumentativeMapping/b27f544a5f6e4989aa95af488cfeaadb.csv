In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious.

Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard.

I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children.

Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful.""

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful.""

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive.

And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father.

I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful.""

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious.

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children.

I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful.""

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that ath",user,30,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful.""

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful.""

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions.

Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Person",user,34,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful.""

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I thi",user,34,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports.

We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting hi",user,36,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics.

She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable.

When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling.

And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable.

She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable.

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about.

She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard.

And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb.

This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful.""

I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport. 

If I were to draw a legal distinction between what I consider dangerous versus what is dangerous enough to constitute a ban on an activity, I would use examples from the United States Code. Specifically, I would use the precedent set by the Hicks Memo. The Hicks Memo set out criteria to identify inherently dangerous activities while still allowing the government agency to regulate while taking into account the countervailing policy interests ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport. 

If I were to draw a legal distinction between what I consider dangerous versus what is dangerous enough to constitute a ban on an activity, I would use examples from the United States Code. Specifically, I would use the precedent set by the Hicks Memo. The Hicks Memo set out criteria to identify inherently dangerous activities while still allowing the government agency to regulate while taking into account the countervailing policy interests.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport. 

If I were to draw a legal distinction between what I consider dangerous versus what is dangerous enough to constitute a ban on an activity, I would use examples from the United States Code. Specifically, I would use the precedent set by the Hicks Memo. The Hicks Memo set out criteria to identify inherently dangerous activities while still allowing the government agency to regulate while taking into account the countervailing policy interests.

She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport. 

If I were to draw a legal distinction between what I consider dangerous versus what is dangerous enough to constitute a ban on an activity, I would use examples from the United States Code.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport. 

If I were to draw a legal distinction between what I consider dangerous versus what is dangerous enough to constitute a ban on an activity, I would use examples from the United States Code. Specifically, I would use the precedent set by the Hicks Memo. The Hicks Memo set out criteria to identify inherently dangerous activities while still allowing the government agency to regulate while taking into account the countervailing policy interests.

One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport. 

If I were to draw a legal distinction between what I consider dangerous versus what is dangerous enough to constitute a ban on an activity, I would use examples from the United States Code.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport.

I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport. 

If I were to draw a legal distinction between what I consider dangerous versus what is dangerous enough to constitute a ban on an activity, I would use examples from the United States Code. Specifically, I would use the precedent set by the Hicks Memo. The Hicks Memo set out criteria to identify inherently dangerous activities while still allowing the government agency to regulate while taking into account the countervailing policy interests.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport. 

If I were to draw a legal distinction between what I consider dangerous versus what is dangerous enough to constitute a ban on an activity, I would use examples from the United States Code.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb.

We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport. 

If I were to draw a legal distinction between what I consider dangerous versus what is dangerous enough to constitute a ban on an activity, I would use examples from the United States Code.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport. 

If I were to draw a legal distinction between what I consider dangerous versus what is dangerous enough to constitute a ban on an activity, I would use examples from the United States Code. Specifically, I would use the precedent set by the Hicks Memo.

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport. 

If I were to draw a legal distinction between what I consider dangerous versus what is dangerous enough to constitute a ban on an activity, I would use examples from the United States Code. Specifically, I would use the precedent set by the Hicks Memo. The Hicks Memo set out criteria to identify inherently dangerous activities while still allowing the government agency to regulate while taking into account the countervailing policy interests. There aren't really many countervailing policy interests that implicate extreme mountain climbing, which means that the balance of factors would weigh heavily in favor of a ban.",api,43,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport. 

If I were to draw a legal distinction between what I consider dangerous versus what is dangerous enough to constitute a ban on an activity, I would use examples from the United States Code. Specifically, I would use the precedent set by the Hicks Memo. The Hicks Memo set out criteria to identify inherently dangerous activities while still allowing the government agency to regulate while taking into account the countervailing policy interests. There aren't really many countervailing policy interests that implicate extreme mountain climbing, which means that the balance of factors would weigh heavily in favor of a ban.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport. 

If I were to draw a legal distinction between what I consider dangerous versus what is dangerous enough to constitute a ban on an activity, I would use examples from the United States Code. Specifically, I would use the precedent set by the Hicks Memo. The Hicks Memo set out criteria to identify inherently dangerous activities while still allowing the government agency to regulate while taking into account the countervailing policy interests. There aren't really many countervailing policy interests that implicate extreme mountain climbing, which means that the balance of factors would weigh heavily in favor of a ban.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport. 

If I were to draw a legal distinction between what I consider dangerous versus what is dangerous enough to constitute a ban on an activity, I would use examples from the United States Code. Specifically, I would use the precedent set by the Hicks Memo.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport. 

If I were to draw a legal distinction between what I consider dangerous versus what is dangerous enough to constitute a ban on an activity, I would use examples from the United States Code. Specifically, I would use the precedent set by the Hicks Memo. The Hicks Memo set out criteria to identify inherently dangerous activities while still allowing the government agency to regulate while taking into account the countervailing policy interests. There aren't really many countervailing policy interests that implicate extreme mountain climbing, which means that the balance of factors would weigh heavily in favor of a ban.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive.

I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport. 

If I were to draw a legal distinction between what I consider dangerous versus what is dangerous enough to constitute a ban on an activity, I would use examples from the United States Code. Specifically, I would use the precedent set by the Hicks Memo. The Hicks Memo set out criteria to identify inherently dangerous activities while still allowing the government agency to regulate while taking into account the countervailing policy interests. There aren't really many countervailing policy interests that implicate extreme mountain climbing, which means that the balance of factors would weigh heavily in favor of a ban.

I urge you to avoid making this activity into a sport because it is too dangerous to do on a regular basis. I'm just looking out for your welfare. I don't ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport. 

If I were to draw a legal distinction between what I consider dangerous versus what is dangerous enough to constitute a ban on an activity, I would use examples from the United States Code.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent.

Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport. 

If I were to draw a legal distinction between what I consider dangerous versus what is dangerous enough to constitute a ban on an activity, I would use examples from the United States Code. Specifically, I would use the precedent set by the Hicks Memo. The Hicks Memo set out criteria to identify inherently dangerous activities while still allowing the government agency to regulate while taking into account the countervailing policy interests. There aren't really many countervailing policy interests that implicate extreme mountain climbing, which means that the balance of factors would weigh heavily in favor of a ban.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport. 

If I were to draw a legal distinction between what I consider dangerous versus what is dangerous enough to constitute a ban on an activity, I would use examples from the United States Code. Specifically, I would use the precedent set by the Hicks Memo. The Hicks Memo set out criteria to identify inherently dangerous activities while still allowing the government agency to regulate while taking into account the countervailing policy interests. There aren't really many countervailing policy interests that implicate extreme mountain climbing, which means that the balance of factors would weigh heavily in favor of a ban.

I urge you to avoid making this activity into a sport because it is too dangerous to do on a regular basis. I'm just looking out for your welfare.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish.
