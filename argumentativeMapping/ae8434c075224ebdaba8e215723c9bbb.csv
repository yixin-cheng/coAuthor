The kind of stereotypical characters that I see or read about that makes me cringe are the ones that are ultimately derivative, lazy, and plain hurtful to the people they are stereotyping.

 I can understand that the author came from a different time period, where such portrayals were the norm, but I would not want to support that kind of thinking.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The kind of stereotypical characters that I see or read about that makes me cringe are the ones that are ultimately derivative, lazy, and plain hurtful to the people they are stereotyping.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

The kind of stereotypical characters that I see or read about that makes me cringe are the ones that are ultimately derivative, lazy, and plain hurtful to the people they are stereotyping. It could be somewhat of a mild trope being shown, and I would react with a mild discomfort as well. However, if the trope or stereotype is taken to an extreme, or if it is a one that I feel is being used to make fun of a group of people, my reaction would be much more significant and negative.

 I can understand that the author came from a different time period, where such portrayals were the norm, but I would not want to support that kind of thinking. I don't find a strong value in reading books with characters that are offensive portrayal of others, in fact I think that those types of books do more harm than good. I believe that for whatever reason the author or creator of the content with stereotypical books, movies or television shows, they are not doing a service to the people that they are stereotyping. 

The characters that are practically stereotypes do harm as they effectively continue the concept of stereotypes, and reinforce the beliefs people hold in society regarding stereotypes.

Therefore, I believe people should support shows and other content that refrains from implementing stereotypes and stereotypical characters. The benefits from lacking such characters in a story can go a long way, and it is critical for these types of stories to become widespread for people to view all groups as equal, and to avoid stereotyping them for certain traits or qualities.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The kind of stereotypical characters that I see or read about that makes me cringe are the ones that are ultimately derivative, lazy, and plain hurtful to the people they are stereotyping. It could be somewhat of a mild trope being shown, and I would react with a mild discomfort as well.

Therefore, I believe people should support shows and other content that refrains from implementing stereotypes and stereotypical characters.
