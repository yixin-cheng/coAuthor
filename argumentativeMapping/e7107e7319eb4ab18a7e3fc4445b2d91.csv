Certain people may not be able to handle the mental stress that comes from constantly watching the news.  The news rarely covers good or uplifting stories.  Most of the stories are focused on crime, disasters, and negative situations.

Most of the stories are focused on crime, disasters, and negative situations.

he news can deceive some people by making them believe that all of society is bad and horrible.
  It can present a sensationalize view of the world.  For example, if a plane crashes, then there will be constant news coverage of the plane crash.  We have 24-hour news channels that will constantly cover the plane crash.  People who are highly influenced by the news may then think that airplanes are not safe to be on.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, you are not a bad citizen if you do not keep up with the news.  The news can be very depressing to watch.  Certain people may not be able to handle the mental stress that comes from constantly watching the news.  The news rarely covers good or uplifting stories.  Most of the stories are focused on crime, disasters, and negative situations.

he news can deceive some people by making them believe that all of society is bad and horrible.
  It can present a sensationalize view of the world.  For example, if a plane crashes, then there will be constant news coverage of the plane crash.  We have 24-hour news channels that will constantly cover the plane crash.  People who are highly influenced by the news may then think that airplanes are not safe to be on.  This is despite that the fact airplane crashes are generally very rare.  

I think there are certain types of people that just don't react well to the news.  They are best focusing on the issues directly affecting them in their lives.   

Ultimately, our number one responsibility in life is to take care of ourselves.  Anything else is good, but not a necessity.   You aren't a bad person if you don't keep up with the news.  In fact, you can still keep up with current events by talking with people.  Engaging with people who have actually experienced the current events may help certain people grasp them better.

In my opinion, you are not a bad citizen if you do not keep up with the news.  The news can be very depressing to watch.  Certain people may not be able to handle the mental stress that comes from constantly watching the news.  The news rarely covers good or uplifting stories.  Most of the stories are focused on crime, disasters, and negative situations.

he news can deceive some people by making them believe that all of society is bad and horrible.
  It can present a sensationalize view of the world.  For example, if a plane crashes, then there will be constant news coverage of the plane crash.  We have 24-hour news channels that will constantly cover the plane crash.  People who are highly influenced by the news may then think that airplanes are not safe to be on.  This is despite that the fact airplane crashes are generally very rare.  

I think there are certain types of people that just don't react well to the news.  They are best focusing on the issues directly affecting them in their lives.   

Ultimately, our number one responsibility in life is to take care of ourselves.  Anything else is good, but not a necessity.   You aren't a bad person if you don't keep up with the news.

In my opinion, you are not a bad citizen if you do not keep up with the news.  The news can be very depressing to watch.  Certain people may not be able to handle the mental stress that comes from constantly watching the news.  The news rarely covers good or uplifting stories.  Most of the stories are focused on crime, disasters, and negative situations.

he news can deceive some people by making them believe that all of society is bad and horrible.
  It can present a sensationalize view of the world.  For example, if a plane crashes, then there will be constant news coverage of the plane crash.  We have 24-hour news channels that will constantly cover the plane crash.  People who are highly influenced by the news may then think that airplanes are not safe to be on.  This is despite that the fact airplane crashes are generally very rare.  

I think there are certain types of people that just don't react well to the news.  They are best focusing on the issues directly affecting them in their lives.   

Ultimately, our number one responsibility in life is to take care of ourselves.  Anything else is good, but not a necessity.   You aren't a bad person if you don't keep up with the news.  In fact, you can still keep up with current events by talking with people.  Engaging with people who have actually experienced the current events may help certain people grasp them better.
