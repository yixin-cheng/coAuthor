In my opinion, technology has made dating much more easier.  It is far easier to find people that share your interests and that would be willing to date you.   have used dating apps and it has been a great experience.
  Before dating apps, I found it pretty hard to meet people that I connected with.  After college, I moved to a town where I didn't know anyone.  I didn't have friends who could introduce me to new people.  I didn't have a job that introduced me to a lot of new people in my age group.   

Dating apps allowed me to find people who were ready to date and were also interested in me.  I have never been the type of person to randomly walk up to a stranger in public to try to kindle a romantic relationship.  I worried about whether they were interested in me.  I worried about whether they were even single and looking to date.  With online dating apps, I never had to worry about that.  I could see that they were interested in me and that they were single.  It was a great way to meet people.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has made dating much more easier.  It is far easier to find people that share your interests and that would be willing to date you.   have used dating apps and it has been a great experience.
  Before dating apps, I found it pretty hard to meet people that I connected with.  After college, I moved to a town where I didn't know anyone.  I didn't have friends who could introduce me to new people.  I didn't have a job that introduced me to a lot of new people in my age group.   

Dating apps allowed me to find people who were ready to date and were also interested in me.  I have never been the type of person to randomly walk up to a stranger in public to try to kindle a romantic relationship.  I worried about whether they were interested in me.  I worried about whether they were even single and looking to date.  With online dating apps, I never had to worry about that.  I could see that they were interested in me and that they were single.  It was a great way to meet people.

In my opinion, technology has made dating much more easier.  It is far easier to find people that share your interests and that would be willing to date you.   have used dating apps and it has been a great experience.
  Before dating apps, I found it pretty hard to meet people that I connected with.  After college, I moved to a town where I didn't know anyone.  I didn't have friends who could introduce me to new people.  I didn't have a job that introduced me to a lot of new people in my age group.   

Dating apps allowed me to find people who were ready to date and were also interested in me.  I have never been the type of person to randomly walk up to a stranger in public to try to kindle a romantic relationship.  I worried about whether they were interested in me.  I worried about whether they were even single and looking to date.  With online dating apps, I never had to worry about that.  I could see that they were interested in me and that they were single.  It was a great way to meet people.

  Before dating apps, I found it pretty hard to meet people that I connected with.  After college, I moved to a town where I didn't know anyone.  I didn't have friends who could introduce me to new people.  I didn't have a job that introduced me to a lot of new people in my age group.   

Dating apps allowed me to find people who were ready to date and were also interested in me.  I have never been the type of person to randomly walk up to a stranger in public to try to kindle a romantic relationship.  I worried about whether they were interested in me.  I worried about whether they were even single and looking to date.  With online dating apps, I never had to worry about that.  I could see that they were interested in me and that they were single.

  Before dating apps, I found it pretty hard to meet people that I connected with.  After college, I moved to a town where I didn't know anyone.  I didn't have friends who could introduce me to new people.  I didn't have a job that introduced me to a lot of new people in my age group.   

Dating apps allowed me to find people who were ready to date and were also interested in me.  I have never been the type of person to randomly walk up to a stranger in public to try to kindle a romantic relationship.  I worried about whether they were interested in me.  I worried about whether they were even single and looking to date.  With online dating apps, I never had to worry about that.  I could see that they were interested in me and that they were single.  It was a great way to meet people.

In my opinion, technology has made dating much more easier.  It is far easier to find people that share your interests and that would be willing to date you.   have used dating apps and it has been a great experience.
  Before dating apps, I found it pretty hard to meet people that I connected with.  After college, I moved to a town where I didn't know anyone.  I didn't have friends who could introduce me to new people.  I didn't have a job that introduced me to a lot of new people in my age group.   

Dating apps allowed me to find people who were ready to date and were also interested in me.  I have never been the type of person to randomly walk up to a stranger in public to try to kindle a romantic relationship.  I worried about whether they were interested in me.  I worried about whether they were even single and looking to date.  With online dating apps, I never had to worry about that.  I could see that they were interested in me and that they were single.  It was a great way to meet people.

  Before dating apps, I found it pretty hard to meet people that I connected with.  After college, I moved to a town where I didn't know anyone.  I didn't have friends who could introduce me to new people.  I didn't have a job that introduced me to a lot of new people in my age group.   

Dating apps allowed me to find people who were ready to date and were also interested in me.  I have never been the type of person to randomly walk up to a stranger in public to try to kindle a romantic relationship.  I worried about whether they were interested in me.  I worried about whether they were even single and looking to date.  With online dating apps, I never had to worry about that.  I could see that they were interested in me and that they were single.  It was a great way to meet people.

I think technology, overall, helps us to be more connected than in the past.  For me, I like having a way to communicate with my significant other even if we are far away.  I think this is a definite improvement on my romantic interactions.  It has helped my relationships to be stronger.  It has also helped me to be more open with my significant other.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has made dating much more easier.  It is far easier to find people that share your interests and that would be willing to date you.   have used dating apps and it has been a great experience.
  Before dating apps, I found it pretty hard to meet people that I connected with.  After college, I moved to a town where I didn't know anyone.  I didn't have friends who could introduce me to new people.  I didn't have a job that introduced me to a lot of new people in my age group.   

Dating apps allowed me to find people who were ready to date and were also interested in me.  I have never been the type of person to randomly walk up to a stranger in public to try to kindle a romantic relationship.  I worried about whether they were interested in me.  I worried about whether they were even single and looking to date.  With online dating apps, I never had to worry about that.  I could see that they were interested in me and that they were single.  It was a great way to meet people.

I think technology, overall, helps us to be more connected than in the past.  For me, I like having a way to communicate with my significant other even if we are far away.  I think this is a definite improvement on my romantic interactions.  It has helped my relationships to be stronger.  It has also helped me to be more open with my significant other.

Dating apps allowed me to find people who were ready to date and were also interested in me.  I have never been the type of person to randomly walk up to a stranger in public to try to kindle a romantic relationship.  I worried about whether they were interested in me.  I worried about whether they were even single and looking to date.  With online dating apps, I never had to worry about that.  I could see that they were interested in me and that they were single.  It was a great way to meet people.

I think technology, overall, helps us to be more connected than in the past.  For me, I like having a way to communicate with my significant other even if we are far away.  I think this is a definite improvement on my romantic interactions.  It has helped my relationships to be stronger.  It has also helped me to be more open with my significant other.

Dating apps allowed me to find people who were ready to date and were also interested in me.  I have never been the type of person to randomly walk up to a stranger in public to try to kindle a romantic relationship.  I worried about whether they were interested in me.  I worried about whether they were even single and looking to date.  With online dating apps, I never had to worry about that.  I could see that they were interested in me and that they were single.  It was a great way to meet people.

I think technology, overall, helps us to be more connected than in the past.  For me, I like having a way to communicate with my significant other even if we are far away.  I think this is a definite improvement on my romantic interactions.  It has helped my relationships to be stronger.  It has also helped me to be more open with my significant other.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has made dating much more easier.  It is far easier to find people that share your interests and that would be willing to date you.   have used dating apps and it has been a great experience.
  Before dating apps, I found it pretty hard to meet people that I connected with.  After college, I moved to a town where I didn't know anyone.  I didn't have friends who could introduce me to new people.  I didn't have a job that introduced me to a lot of new people in my age group.   

Dating apps allowed me to find people who were ready to date and were also interested in me.  I have never been the type of person to randomly walk up to a stranger in public to try to kindle a romantic relationship.  I worried about whether they were interested in me.  I worried about whether they were even single and looking to date.  With online dating apps, I never had to worry about that.  I could see that they were interested in me and that they were single.  It was a great way to meet people.

I think technology, overall, helps us to be more connected than in the past.  For me, I like having a way to communicate with my significant other even if we are far away.  I think this is a definite improvement on my romantic interactions.  It has helped my relationships to be stronger.  It has also helped me to be more open with my significant other.

In my opinion, technology has made dating much more easier.  It is far easier to find people that share your interests and that would be willing to date you.   have used dating apps and it has been a great experience.
  Before dating apps, I found it pretty hard to meet people that I connected with.  After college, I moved to a town where I didn't know anyone.  I didn't have friends who could introduce me to new people.  I didn't have a job that introduced me to a lot of new people in my age group.   

Dating apps allowed me to find people who were ready to date and were also interested in me.  I have never been the type of person to randomly walk up to a stranger in public to try to kindle a romantic relationship.  I worried about whether they were interested in me.  I worried about whether they were even single and looking to date.  With online dating apps, I never had to worry about that.  I could see that they were interested in me and that they were single.  It was a great way to meet people.

It was a great way to meet people.

I think this is a definite improvement on my romantic interactions.  It has helped my relationships to be stronger.  It has also helped me to be more open with my significant other.

I have never been the type of person to randomly walk up to a stranger in public to try to kindle a romantic relationship.  I worried about whether they were interested in me.  I worried about whether they were even single and looking to date.  With online dating apps, I never had to worry about that.  I could see that they were interested in me and that they were single.  It was a great way to meet people.

I think technology, overall, helps us to be more connected than in the past.  For me, I like having a way to communicate with my significant other even if we are far away.  I think this is a definite improvement on my romantic interactions.  It has helped my relationships to be stronger.  It has also helped me to be more open with my significant other.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has made dating much more easier.  It is far easier to find people that share your interests and that would be willing to date you.   have used dating apps and it has been a great experience.
  Before dating apps, I found it pretty hard to meet people that I connected with.  After college, I moved to a town where I didn't know anyone.  I didn't have friends who could introduce me to new people.  I didn't have a job that introduced me to a lot of new people in my age group.   

Dating apps allowed me to find people who were ready to date and were also interested in me.  I have never been the type of person to randomly walk up to a stranger in public to try to kindle a romantic relationship.  I worried about whether they were interested in me.  I worried about whether they were even single and looking to date.  With online dating apps, I never had to worry about that.  I could see that they were interested in me and that they were single.  It was a great way to meet people.

I think technology, overall, helps us to be more connected than in the past.  For me, I like having a way to communicate with my significant other even if we are far away.  I think this is a definite improvement on my romantic interactions.  It has helped my relationships to be stronger.  It has also helped me to be more open with my significant other.

In my opinion, technology has made dating much more easier.  It is far easier to find people that share your interests and that would be willing to date you.   have used dating apps and it has been a great experience.
  Before dating apps, I found it pretty hard to meet people that I connected with.  After college, I moved to a town where I didn't know anyone.  I didn't have friends who could introduce me to new people.  I didn't have a job that introduced me to a lot of new people in my age group.   

Dating apps allowed me to find people who were ready to date and were also interested in me.  I have never been the type of person to randomly walk up to a stranger in public to try to kindle a romantic relationship.  I worried about whether they were interested in me.  I worried about whether they were even single and looking to date.  With online dating apps, I never had to worry about that.  I could see that they were interested in me and that they were single.  It was a great way to meet people.

I think technology, overall, helps us to be more connected than in the past.  For me, I like having a way to communicate with my significant other even if we are far away.  I think this is a definite improvement on my romantic interactions.  It has helped my relationships to be stronger.  It has also helped me to be more open with my significant other.

I have never been the type of person to randomly walk up to a stranger in public to try to kindle a romantic relationship.  I worried about whether they were interested in me.  I worried about whether they were even single and looking to date.  With online dating apps, I never had to worry about that.  I could see that they were interested in me and that they were single.  It was a great way to meet people.

I have never been the type of person to randomly walk up to a stranger in public to try to kindle a romantic relationship.  I worried about whether they were interested in me.  I worried about whether they were even single and looking to date.  With online dating apps, I never had to worry about that.  I could see that they were interested in me and that they were single.  It was a great way to meet people.

I think technology, overall, helps us to be more connected than in the past.  For me, I like having a way to communicate with my significant other even if we are far away.  I think this is a definite improvement on my romantic interactions.  It has helped my relationships to be stronger.  It has also helped me to be more open with my significant other.

Dating apps allowed me to find people who were ready to date and were also interested in me.  I have never been the type of person to randomly walk up to a stranger in public to try to kindle a romantic relationship.  I worried about whether they were interested in me.  I worried about whether they were even single and looking to date.  With online dating apps, I never had to worry about that.  I could see that they were interested in me and that they were single.  It was a great way to meet people.

I think technology, overall, helps us to be more connected than in the past.  For me, I like having a way to communicate with my significant other even if we are far away.  I think this is a definite improvement on my romantic interactions.  It has helped my relationships to be stronger.  It has also helped me to be more open with my significant other.
