Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there is no such thing as a ""too dangerous"" sport. If you are willing to accept the risks, then you should be allowed to pursue your sport.  All sports have risk.  Studies show that chess grandmasters have elevated blood flow and higher risk of aneurysms. You can die at any time, doing anything. It's just a matter of how much risk you are willing to accept. 

 think it's a matter of personal choice.
 If you want to climb a mountain, then climb it. If you want to jump out of a plane, then jump out of a plane. If you want to race cars, then race cars. If you want to be a stuntman, then be a stuntman. When there's enough people agreeing with you that they like it, doing an activity to warrant competitions, then we can call it a sport, as long as it doesn't harm others. 
I think that if you are willing to accept the risks, then you should be allowed to pursue your sport.
 If you remove the personal effort and risk, most sports would become nothing but people simultaneous exercising.  Risk has appeal, and the balancing of it with rewards is everything. 

People should be educated about the risks. If they choose to participate anyway, then that's their choice. Anything less takes away from their freedom. ",user,18,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1
