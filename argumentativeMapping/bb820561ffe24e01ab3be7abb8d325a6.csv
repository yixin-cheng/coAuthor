I have also seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans arnd their culture ae portrayed as wall-ise, spiritual, and/or mystical.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotype is the portrayal of Native Americans. I have seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans are portrayed as savages, uncivilized, and/or unintelligent. Later-dated portrayals show them as drunks, jean jacket-clad, greasy, no-lifers waiting on the side of the road for the next handout. 
I have also seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans arnd their culture ae portrayed as wall-ise, spiritual, and/or mystical.
 They are often shown as the ""keepers of the earth"" or the ""keepers of the balance"",  the ""keepers of the ancient wisdom.""

This fetishization is damaging. People are not dichotomous. There were periods of time where tribes would murder and scalp their enemies. They would eat the heart of their foes. here were also periods of time where tribes would treat their enemies with respect and kindness.


Native Americans have doctors, scientists, lawyers, and engineers. They also have hobos and lazy individuals, the same as any other race.

I have also seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans arnd their culture ae portrayed as wall-ise, spiritual, and/or mystical.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotype is the portrayal of Native Americans. I have seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans are portrayed as savages, uncivilized, and/or unintelligent. Later-dated portrayals show them as drunks, jean jacket-clad, greasy, no-lifers waiting on the side of the road for the next handout. 
I have also seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans arnd their culture ae portrayed as wall-ise, spiritual, and/or mystical.
 They are often shown as the ""keepers of the earth"" or the ""keepers of the balance"",  the ""keepers of the ancient wisdom.""

This fetishization is damaging. People are not dichotomous. There were periods of time where tribes would murder and scalp their enemies. They would eat the heart of their foes. here were also periods of time where tribes would treat their enemies with respect and kindness.


Native Americans have doctors, scientists, lawyers, and engineers. They also have hobos and lazy individuals, the same as any other race.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotype is the portrayal of Native Americans. I have seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans are portrayed as savages, uncivilized, and/or unintelligent. Later-dated portrayals show them as drunks, jean jacket-clad, greasy, no-lifers waiting on the side of the road for the next handout. 
I have also seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans arnd their culture ae portrayed as wall-ise, spiritual, and/or mystical.
 They are often shown as the ""keepers of the earth"" or the ""keepers of the balance"",  the ""keepers of the ancient wisdom.""

This fetishization is damaging. People are not dichotomous. There were periods of time where tribes would murder and scalp their enemies. They would eat the heart of their foes. here were also periods of time where tribes would treat their enemies with respect and kindness.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotype is the portrayal of Native Americans. I have seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans are portrayed as savages, uncivilized, and/or unintelligent. Later-dated portrayals show them as drunks, jean jacket-clad, greasy, no-lifers waiting on the side of the road for the next handout. 
I have also seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans arnd their culture ae portrayed as wall-ise, spiritual, and/or mystical.
 They are often shown as the ""keepers of the earth"" or the ""keepers of the balance"",  the ""keepers of the ancient wisdom.""

This fetishization is damaging. People are not dichotomous. There were periods of time where tribes would murder and scalp their enemies. They would eat the heart of their foes. here were also periods of time where tribes would treat their enemies with respect and kindness.


Native Americans have doctors, scientists, lawyers, and engineers. They also have hobos and lazy individuals, the same as any other race. 
It's time media began portraying them more realistically, as a people, diverse, with rich history of both failures and successes.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotype is the portrayal of Native Americans. I have seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans are portrayed as savages, uncivilized, and/or unintelligent. Later-dated portrayals show them as drunks, jean jacket-clad, greasy, no-lifers waiting on the side of the road for the next handout. 
I have also seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans arnd their culture ae portrayed as wall-ise, spiritual, and/or mystical.
 They are often shown as the ""keepers of the earth"" or the ""keepers of the balance"",  the ""keepers of the ancient wisdom.""

This fetishization is damaging. People are not dichotomous. There were periods of time where tribes would murder and scalp their enemies. They would eat the heart of their foes. here were also periods of time where tribes would treat their enemies with respect and kindness.


Native Americans have doctors, scientists, lawyers, and engineers. They also have hobos and lazy individuals, the same as any other race. 
It's time media began portraying them more realistically, as a people, diverse, with rich history of both failures and successes. 

Until the media can be more fair, I won't watch shows or read books that support this lazy thinking. This is how racism begins, and I won't be any part of it!.
