Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York.

Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first mar",user,28,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that sala",user,28,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Swho met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter.",user,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1

While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.

Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.

But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter.

Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. An",user,36,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of",user,37,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking.

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside.

While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation",user,37,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, bcea",user,37,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by",user,37,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point , I was really into him.",api,37,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.

Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people.

Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him ",user,38,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter.

Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. ",user,41,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan.

I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan.

I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.",user,45,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan.

But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York.

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter.

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter.

But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York.

I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan.

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, be",user,46,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to",user,46,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter.

Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more j",user,46,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it!",user,46,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside.

Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We",user,48,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We're getting married in",user,48,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking.

Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people.

I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside.

Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We're getting married in less than a month now an",user,48,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We're getting married in less than a month now and I can't wait! If it we",user,49,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan.

I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We're getting married in less than a month now and I can't wait! If it weren't for Tinder, I never would have met Matt. An",user,50,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We're getting married in less than a month now and I can't wait! If it weren't for Tinder, I never would have met Matt. And if I hadn'",user,50,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We're getting married in less than a month now and I can't wait! If it weren't for Tinder, I never would have met Matt. And if I hadn't met Matt,",user,50,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We're getting married in less than a month now and I can't wait! If it weren't for Tinder, I never would have met Matt. And if I hadn't met Matt, I certa",user,50,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We're getting married in less than a month now and I can't wait! If it weren't for Tinder, I never would have met Matt.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking.

He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We're getting married in less than a month now and I can't wait! If it weren't for Tinder, I never would have met Matt.

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking.

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We're getting married in less than a month now and I can't wait! If it weren't for Tinder, I never would have met Matt.

Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We're getting married in less than a month now and I can't wait! If it weren't for Tinder, I never would have met Matt. And if I hadn't met Matt, I certainly wouldn't be having as much fun as I am now. So I'm",user,51,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We're getting married in less than a month now and I can't wait! If it weren't for Tinder, I never would have met Matt. And if I hadn't met Matt, I certainly wouldn't be having as much fun as I am now. So I am a fir",user,51,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last.

I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We're getting married in less than a month now and I can't wait! If it weren't for Tinder, I never would have met Matt. And if I hadn't met Matt, I certainly wouldn't be having as much fun as I am now. So I am a firm believer that",user,51,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside.
