text-insert,"Should Schools Provide Free Pads and Tampons?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide free pads and tampons to students. It's a basic medical need. For girls of a certain age, they may be at school when they get their first period. Pads or tampons would be needed to address the issue at that time. 
I think that pads and tampons are similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools
. Those are not taboo products so a pad or tampon should not be either. It should be treated like when a child scrapes their elbow and needs help. They are given a bandage to cover their wound. 

This brings up one issue though. Having tampons and pads at school for an emergency is one thing. Should they provide them for students to bring home as well? Not every student can afford to purchase such products. I think that if a student is in need, they should be able to get them from the school. It's similar to students who get free breakfast. If someone qualifies for that program then they should be eligible for free pads and tampons. 

It's a basic right to have the products that you need for medical issues. These should be provided if your parents can not afford them. It's not a luxury item. It's a necessity. Students should have access to these products. Some parents may find it wrong for the school to offer them. That's their right but we should only care about the welfare of these students. 

If a school can provide toilet paper and bandages then it can provide tampons and pads. There shouldn't be any debate about it. We have to put the student's medical needs before any issues with topics that we may consider taboo. ",user,31,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1
