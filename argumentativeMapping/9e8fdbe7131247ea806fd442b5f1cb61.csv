The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the screen usage of a typical human have significantly increased over the years, and I do not want to be hypocritical, but right now, I think I'd rather read a book than a newspaper or watch TV. My dependence for screens is very much like a drug. I do not know what do with myself one day when my computer broke and I needed to purchase a part and it has not arrived yet. I was going crazy.

There was more to life than checking my e-mail every few minutes or browsing the Web for background information to support a presentation. Sure, having access to phones and computers all the time has its benefits. For one, there are plenty of ways this digital age allows us to communicate with people across the globe, and there are also lots of ways we are able to educate people without the need for one on one contact, specially during the time of the pandemic, when it is mandatory to keep distance from other people.

But it's definitely ruining my life. The same way how drugs overused can ruin someone's life when they're addicted to it, overly involved in computer, video games or other applications is the same. There was nothing interesting to do in my house, nor in my neighborhood, or anywhere in the town, and I became totally dependent for my entertainment. I did not want to communicate with people, because there was nothing to talk about and I was tired of it. My social intelligence and how I connect with people have become a bit damaged, only because I was left alone with this computer and now, I never know what to do with myself when I'm out in the open. It's very scary.

My dependence for screens is very much like a drug. I do not know what do with myself one day when my computer broke and I needed to purchase a part and it has not arrived yet. I was going crazy.

There was more to life than checking my e-mail every few minutes or browsing the Web for background information to support a presentation. Sure, having access to phones and computers all the time has its benefits. For one, there are plenty of ways this digital age allows us to communicate with people across the globe, and there are also lots of ways we are able to educate people without the need for one on one contact, specially during the time of the pandemic, when it is mandatory to keep distance from other people.

But it's definitely ruining my life. The same way how drugs overused can ruin someone's life when they're addicted to it, overly involved in computer, video games or other applications is the same. There was nothing interesting to do in my house, nor in my neighborhood, or anywhere in the town, and I became totally dependent for my entertainment. I did not want to communicate with people, because there was nothing to talk about and I was tired of it. My social intelligence and how I connect with people have become a bit damaged, only because I was left alone with this computer and now, I never know what to do with myself when I'm out in the open. It's very scary.

So yeah, while I do not want humanity to go back to the Dark Ages, when there were no electrical devices invented, I do not think it will be a good idea for humanity to go through another Dark Age. A",user,19,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

It's very scary.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the screen usage of a typical human have significantly increased over the years, and I do not want to be hypocritical, but right now, I think I'd rather read a book than a newspaper or watch TV. My dependence for screens is very much like a drug. I do not know what do with myself one day when my computer broke and I needed to purchase a part and it has not arrived yet. I was going crazy.

There was more to life than checking my e-mail every few minutes or browsing the Web for background information to support a presentation. Sure, having access to phones and computers all the time has its benefits. For one, there are plenty of ways this digital age allows us to communicate with people across the globe, and there are also lots of ways we are able to educate people without the need for one on one contact, specially during the time of the pandemic, when it is mandatory to keep distance from other people.

But it's definitely ruining my life. The same way how drugs overused can ruin someone's life when they're addicted to it, overly involved in computer, video games or other applications is the same. There was nothing interesting to do in my house, nor in my neighborhood, or anywhere in the town, and I became totally dependent for my entertainment. I did not want to communicate with people, because there was nothing to talk about and I was tired of it. My social intelligence and how I connect with people have become a bit damaged, only because I was left alone with this computer and now, I never know what to do with myself when I'm out in the open. It's very scary.

So yeah, while I do not want humanity to go back to the Dark Ages, when there were no electrical devices invented, I do not think it will be a good idea for humanity to go through another Dark Age. And there's no denying that having all the humanities' knowledge and information at your finger tips is not a bad thing.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the screen usage of a typical human have significantly increased over the years, and I do not want to be hypocritical, but right now, I think I'd rather read a book than a newspaper or watch TV. My dependence for screens is very much like a drug. I do not know what do with myself one day when my computer broke and I needed to purchase a part and it has not arrived yet. I was going crazy.

There was more to life than checking my e-mail every few minutes or browsing the Web for background information to support a presentation. Sure, having access to phones and computers all the time has its benefits. For one, there are plenty of ways this digital age allows us to communicate with people across the globe, and there are also lots of ways we are able to educate people without the need for one on one contact, specially during the time of the pandemic, when it is mandatory to keep distance from other people.

There was nothing interesting to do in my house, nor in my neighborhood, or anywhere in the town, and I became totally dependent for my entertainment. I did not want to communicate with people, because there was nothing to talk about and I was tired of it.

So yeah, while I do not want humanity to go back to the Dark Ages, when there were no electrical devices invented, I do not think it will be a good idea for humanity to go through another Dark Age.

Sure, having access to phones and computers all the time has its benefits. For one, there are plenty of ways this digital age allows us to communicate with people across the globe, and there are also lots of ways we are able to educate people without the need for one on one contact, specially during the time of the pandemic, when it is mandatory to keep distance from other people.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the screen usage of a typical human have significantly increased over the years, and I do not want to be hypocritical, but right now, I think I'd rather read a book than a newspaper or watch TV. My dependence for screens is very much like a drug. I do not know what do with myself one day when my computer broke and I needed to purchase a part and it has not arrived yet. I was going crazy.

There was more to life than checking my e-mail every few minutes or browsing the Web for background information to support a presentation. Sure, having access to phones and computers all the time has its benefits. For one, there are plenty of ways this digital age allows us to communicate with people across the globe, and there are also lots of ways we are able to educate people without the need for one on one contact, specially during the time of the pandemic, when it is mandatory to keep distance from other people.

But it's definitely ruining my life. The same way how drugs overused can ruin someone's life when they're addicted to it, overly involved in computer, video games or other applications is the same. There was nothing interesting to do in my house, nor in my neighborhood, or anywhere in the town, and I became totally dependent for my entertainment. I did not want to communicate with people, because there was nothing to talk about and I was tired of it. My social intelligence and how I connect with people have become a bit damaged, only because I was left alone with this computer and now, I never know what to do with myself when I'm out in the open. It's very scary.

So yeah, while I do not want humanity to go back to the Dark Ages, when there were no electrical devices invented, I do not think it will be a good idea for humanity to go through another Dark Age. And there's no denying that having all the humanities' knowledge and information at your finger tips is not a bad thing. But at the same time, aspects that you normally do not consider that's being damaged like social intelligence and the ability to remember things, are negatively impacted.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the screen usage of a typical human have significantly increased over the years, and I do not want to be hypocritical, but right now, I think I'd rather read a book than a newspaper or watch TV. My dependence for screens is very much like a drug. I do not know what do with myself one day when my computer broke and I needed to purchase a part and it has not arrived yet. I was going crazy.

There was more to life than checking my e-mail every few minutes or browsing the Web for background information to support a presentation. Sure, having access to phones and computers all the time has its benefits. For one, there are plenty of ways this digital age allows us to communicate with people across the globe, and there are also lots of ways we are able to educate people without the need for one on one contact, specially during the time of the pandemic, when it is mandatory to keep distance from other people.

But it's definitely ruining my life. The same way how drugs overused can ruin someone's life when they're addicted to it, overly involved in computer, video games or other applications is the same. There was nothing interesting to do in my house, nor in my neighborhood, or anywhere in the town, and I became totally dependent for my entertainment. I did not want to communicate with people, because there was nothing to talk about and I was tired of it. My social intelligence and how I connect with people have become a bit damaged, only because I was left alone with this computer and now, I never know what to do with myself when I'm out in the open. It's very scary.

So yeah, while I do not want humanity to go back to the Dark Ages, when there were no electrical devices invented, I do not think it will be a good idea for humanity to go through another Dark Age. And there's no denying that having all the humanities' knowledge and information at your finger tips is not a bad thing. But at the same time, aspects that you normally do not consider that's being damaged like social intelligence and the ability to remember things, are negatively impacted.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the screen usage of a typical human have significantly increased over the years, and I do not want to be hypocritical, but right now, I think I'd rather read a book than a newspaper or watch TV. My dependence for screens is very much like a drug. I do not know what do with myself one day when my computer broke and I needed to purchase a part and it has not arrived yet. I was going crazy.

In my opinion, the screen usage of a typical human have significantly increased over the years, and I do not want to be hypocritical, but right now, I think I'd rather read a book than a newspaper or watch TV. My dependence for screens is very much like a drug. I do not know what do with myself one day when my computer broke and I needed to purchase a part and it has not arrived yet. I was going crazy.

There was more to life than checking my e-mail every few minutes or browsing the Web for background information to support a presentation. Sure, having access to phones and computers all the time has its benefits. For one, there are plenty of ways this digital age allows us to communicate with people across the globe, and there are also lots of ways we are able to educate people without the need for one on one contact, specially during the time of the pandemic, when it is mandatory to keep distance from other people.

But it's definitely ruining my life. The same way how drugs overused can ruin someone's life when they're addicted to it, overly involved in computer, video games or other applications is the same. There was nothing interesting to do in my house, nor in my neighborhood, or anywhere in the town, and I became totally dependent for my entertainment. I did not want to communicate with people, because there was nothing to talk about and I was tired of it. My social intelligence and how I connect with people have become a bit damaged, only because I was left alone with this computer and now, I never know what to do with myself when I'm out in the open. It's very scary.

So yeah, while I do not want humanity to go back to the Dark Ages, when there were no electrical devices invented, I do not think it will be a good idea for humanity to go through another Dark Age. And there's no denying that having all the humanities' knowledge and information at your finger tips is not a bad thing. But at the same time, aspects that you normally do not consider that's being damaged like social intelligence and the ability to remember things, are negatively impacted. Our reliance to technology has to be limited at one point, not just because it is a good practice to do if you want to keep your life on track.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the screen usage of a typical human have significantly increased over the years, and I do not want to be hypocritical, but right now, I think I'd rather read a book than a newspaper or watch TV. My dependence for screens is very much like a drug. I do not know what do with myself one day when my computer broke and I needed to purchase a part and it has not arrived yet. I was going crazy.

There was more to life than checking my e-mail every few minutes or browsing the Web for background information to support a presentation. Sure, having access to phones and computers all the time has its benefits. For one, there are plenty of ways this digital age allows us to communicate with people across the globe, and there are also lots of ways we are able to educate people without the need for one on one contact, specially during the time of the pandemic, when it is mandatory to keep distance from other people.

But it's definitely ruining my life. The same way how drugs overused can ruin someone's life when they're addicted to it, overly involved in computer, video games or other applications is the same. There was nothing interesting to do in my house, nor in my neighborhood, or anywhere in the town, and I became totally dependent for my entertainment. I did not want to communicate with people, because there was nothing to talk about and I was tired of it. My social intelligence and how I connect with people have become a bit damaged, only because I was left alone with this computer and now, I never know what to do with myself when I'm out in the open. It's very scary.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the screen usage of a typical human have significantly increased over the years, and I do not want to be hypocritical, but right now, I think I'd rather read a book than a newspaper or watch TV. My dependence for screens is very much like a drug. I do not know what do with myself one day when my computer broke and I needed to purchase a part and it has not arrived yet. I was going crazy.

There was more to life than checking my e-mail every few minutes or browsing the Web for background information to support a presentation. Sure, having access to phones and computers all the time has its benefits. For one, there are plenty of ways this digital age allows us to communicate with people across the globe, and there are also lots of ways we are able to educate people without the need for one on one contact, specially during the time of the pandemic, when it is mandatory to keep distance from other people.

But it's definitely ruining my life. The same way how drugs overused can ruin someone's life when they're addicted to it, overly involved in computer, video games or other applications is the same. There was nothing interesting to do in my house, nor in my neighborhood, or anywhere in the town, and I became totally dependent for my entertainment. I did not want to communicate with people, because there was nothing to talk about and I was tired of it. My social intelligence and how I connect with people have become a bit damaged, only because I was left alone with this computer and now, I never know what to do with myself when I'm out in the open. It's very scary.

So yeah, while I do not want humanity to go back to the Dark Ages, when there were no electrical devices invented, I do not think it will be a good idea for humanity to go through another Dark Age.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the screen usage of a typical human have significantly increased over the years, and I do not want to be hypocritical, but right now, I think I'd rather read a book than a newspaper or watch TV. My dependence for screens is very much like a drug. I do not know what do with myself one day when my computer broke and I needed to purchase a part and it has not arrived yet. I was going crazy.

There was more to life than checking my e-mail every few minutes or browsing the Web for background information to support a presentation. Sure, having access to phones and computers all the time has its benefits. For one, there are plenty of ways this digital age allows us to communicate with people across the globe, and there are also lots of ways we are able to educate people without the need for one on one contact, specially during the time of the pandemic, when it is mandatory to keep distance from other people.

But it's definitely ruining my life. The same way how drugs overused can ruin someone's life when they're addicted to it, overly involved in computer, video games or other applications is the same. There was nothing interesting to do in my house, nor in my neighborhood, or anywhere in the town, and I became totally dependent for my entertainment. I did not want to communicate with people, because there was nothing to talk about and I was tired of it. My social intelligence and how I connect with people have become a bit damaged, only because I was left alone with this computer and now, I never know what to do with myself when I'm out in the open. It's very scary.

So yeah, while I do not want humanity to go back to the Dark Ages, when there were no electrical devices invented, I do not think it will be a good idea for humanity to go through another Dark Age.

My dependence for screens is very much like a drug. I do not know what do with myself one day when my computer broke and I needed to purchase a part and it has not arrived yet. I was going crazy.

There was more to life than checking my e-mail every few minutes or browsing the Web for background information to support a presentation. Sure, having access to phones and computers all the time has its benefits. For one, there are plenty of ways this digital age allows us to communicate with people across the globe, and there are also lots of ways we are able to educate people without the need for one on one contact, specially during the time of the pandemic, when it is mandatory to keep distance from other people.

But it's definitely ruining my life. The same way how drugs overused can ruin someone's life when they're addicted to it, overly involved in computer, video games or other applications is the same. There was nothing interesting to do in my house, nor in my neighborhood, or anywhere in the town, and I became totally dependent for my entertainment. I did not want to communicate with people, because there was nothing to talk about and I was tired of it. My social intelligence and how I connect with people have become a bit damaged, only because I was left alone with this computer and now, I never know what to do with myself when I'm out in the open. It's very scary.

So yeah, while I do not want humanity to go back to the Dark Ages, when there were no electrical devices invented, I do not think it will be a good idea for humanity to go through another Dark Age. And there's no denying that having all the humanities' knowledge and information at your finger tips is not a bad thing. But at the same time, aspects that you normally do not consider that's being damaged like social intelligence and the ability to remember things, are negatively impacted. Our reliance to technology has to be limited at one point, not just because it is a good practice to do if you want to keep your life on track.

As for me, I will try my best to contact more people I know and if we can return to normal, possibly even go to the town once again. Find more people to communicate with, and try to carefully pick and choose what technology, video games, programs or apps I decide to use. Sc",user,24,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the screen usage of a typical human have significantly increased over the years, and I do not want to be hypocritical, but right now, I think I'd rather read a book than a newspaper or watch TV. My dependence for screens is very much like a drug. I do not know what do with myself one day when my computer broke and I needed to purchase a part and it has not arrived yet. I was going crazy.

There was more to life than checking my e-mail every few minutes or browsing the Web for background information to support a presentation. Sure, having access to phones and computers all the time has its benefits. For one, there are plenty of ways this digital age allows us to communicate with people across the globe, and there are also lots of ways we are able to educate people without the need for one on one contact, specially during the time of the pandemic, when it is mandatory to keep distance from other people.

But it's definitely ruining my life. The same way how drugs overused can ruin someone's life when they're addicted to it, overly involved in computer, video games or other applications is the same. There was nothing interesting to do in my house, nor in my neighborhood, or anywhere in the town, and I became totally dependent for my entertainment. I did not want to communicate with people, because there was nothing to talk about and I was tired of it. My social intelligence and how I connect with people have become a bit damaged, only because I was left alone with this computer and now, I never know what to do with myself when I'm out in the open. It's very scary.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the screen usage of a typical human have significantly increased over the years, and I do not want to be hypocritical, but right now, I think I'd rather read a book than a newspaper or watch TV. My dependence for screens is very much like a drug. I do not know what do with myself one day when my computer broke and I needed to purchase a part and it has not arrived yet. I was going crazy.

There was more to life than checking my e-mail every few minutes or browsing the Web for background information to support a presentation. Sure, having access to phones and computers all the time has its benefits. For one, there are plenty of ways this digital age allows us to communicate with people across the globe, and there are also lots of ways we are able to educate people without the need for one on one contact, specially during the time of the pandemic, when it is mandatory to keep distance from other people.

But it's definitely ruining my life. The same way how drugs overused can ruin someone's life when they're addicted to it, overly involved in computer, video games or other applications is the same. There was nothing interesting to do in my house, nor in my neighborhood, or anywhere in the town, and I became totally dependent for my entertainment. I did not want to communicate with people, because there was nothing to talk about and I was tired of it. My social intelligence and how I connect with people have become a bit damaged, only because I was left alone with this computer and now, I never know what to do with myself when I'm out in the open. It's very scary.

So yeah, while I do not want humanity to go back to the Dark Ages, when there were no electrical devices invented, I do not think it will be a good idea for humanity to go through another Dark Age.

In my opinion, the screen usage of a typical human have significantly increased over the years, and I do not want to be hypocritical, but right now, I think I'd rather read a book than a newspaper or watch TV. My dependence for screens is very much like a drug. I do not know what do with myself one day when my computer broke and I needed to purchase a part and it has not arrived yet. I was going crazy.

There was more to life than checking my e-mail every few minutes or browsing the Web for background information to support a presentation. Sure, having access to phones and computers all the time has its benefits. For one, there are plenty of ways this digital age allows us to communicate with people across the globe, and there are also lots of ways we are able to educate people without the need for one on one contact, specially during the time of the pandemic, when it is mandatory to keep distance from other people.

But it's definitely ruining my life. The same way how drugs overused can ruin someone's life when they're addicted to it, overly involved in computer, video games or other applications is the same. There was nothing interesting to do in my house, nor in my neighborhood, or anywhere in the town, and I became totally dependent for my entertainment. I did not want to communicate with people, because there was nothing to talk about and I was tired of it. My social intelligence and how I connect with people have become a bit damaged, only because I was left alone with this computer and now, I never know what to do with myself when I'm out in the open. It's very scary.

So yeah, while I do not want humanity to go back to the Dark Ages, when there were no electrical devices invented, I do not think it will be a good idea for humanity to go through another Dark Age. And there's no denying that having all the humanities' knowledge and information at your finger tips is not a bad thing. But at the same time, aspects that you normally do not consider that's being damaged like social intelligence and the ability to remember things, are negatively impacted. Our reliance to technology has to be limited at one point, not just because it is a good practice to do if you want to keep your life on track.

As for me, I will try my best to contact more people I know and if we can return to normal, possibly even go to the town once again.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the screen usage of a typical human have significantly increased over the years, and I do not want to be hypocritical, but right now, I think I'd rather read a book than a newspaper or watch TV. My dependence for screens is very much like a drug. I do not know what do with myself one day when my computer broke and I needed to purchase a part and it has not arrived yet. I was going crazy.

There was more to life than checking my e-mail every few minutes or browsing the Web for background information to support a presentation. Sure, having access to phones and computers all the time has its benefits. For one, there are plenty of ways this digital age allows us to communicate with people across the globe, and there are also lots of ways we are able to educate people without the need for one on one contact, specially during the time of the pandemic, when it is mandatory to keep distance from other people.

But it's definitely ruining my life. The same way how drugs overused can ruin someone's life when they're addicted to it, overly involved in computer, video games or other applications is the same. There was nothing interesting to do in my house, nor in my neighborhood, or anywhere in the town, and I became totally dependent for my entertainment. I did not want to communicate with people, because there was nothing to talk about and I was tired of it. My social intelligence and how I connect with people have become a bit damaged, only because I was left alone with this computer and now, I never know what to do with myself when I'm out in the open. It's very scary.

So yeah, while I do not want humanity to go back to the Dark Ages, when there were no electrical devices invented, I do not think it will be a good idea for humanity to go through another Dark Age. And there's no denying that having all the humanities' knowledge and information at your finger tips is not a bad thing.

As for me, I will try my best to contact more people I know and if we can return to normal, possibly even go to the town once again. Find more people to communicate with, and try to carefully pick and choose what technology, video games, programs or apps I decide to use.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the screen usage of a typical human have significantly increased over the years, and I do not want to be hypocritical, but right now, I think I'd rather read a book than a newspaper or watch TV. My dependence for screens is very much like a drug. I do not know what do with myself one day when my computer broke and I needed to purchase a part and it has not arrived yet. I was going crazy.

There was more to life than checking my e-mail every few minutes or browsing the Web for background information to support a presentation. Sure, having access to phones and computers all the time has its benefits. For one, there are plenty of ways this digital age allows us to communicate with people across the globe, and there are also lots of ways we are able to educate people without the need for one on one contact, specially during the time of the pandemic, when it is mandatory to keep distance from other people.

But it's definitely ruining my life. The same way how drugs overused can ruin someone's life when they're addicted to it, overly involved in computer, video games or other applications is the same. There was nothing interesting to do in my house, nor in my neighborhood, or anywhere in the town, and I became totally dependent for my entertainment. I did not want to communicate with people, because there was nothing to talk about and I was tired of it. My social intelligence and how I connect with people have become a bit damaged, only because I was left alone with this computer and now, I never know what to do with myself when I'm out in the open. It's very scary.

So yeah, while I do not want humanity to go back to the Dark Ages, when there were no electrical devices invented, I do not think it will be a good idea for humanity to go through another Dark Age.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the screen usage of a typical human have significantly increased over the years, and I do not want to be hypocritical, but right now, I think I'd rather read a book than a newspaper or watch TV. My dependence for screens is very much like a drug. I do not know what do with myself one day when my computer broke and I needed to purchase a part and it has not arrived yet. I was going crazy.

There was more to life than checking my e-mail every few minutes or browsing the Web for background information to support a presentation. Sure, having access to phones and computers all the time has its benefits. For one, there are plenty of ways this digital age allows us to communicate with people across the globe, and there are also lots of ways we are able to educate people without the need for one on one contact, specially during the time of the pandemic, when it is mandatory to keep distance from other people.

But it's definitely ruining my life. The same way how drugs overused can ruin someone's life when they're addicted to it, overly involved in computer, video games or other applications is the same. There was nothing interesting to do in my house, nor in my neighborhood, or anywhere in the town, and I became totally dependent for my entertainment. I did not want to communicate with people, because there was nothing to talk about and I was tired of it.

So yeah, while I do not want humanity to go back to the Dark Ages, when there were no electrical devices invented, I do not think it will be a good idea for humanity to go through another Dark Age.

Our reliance to technology has to be limited at one point, not just because it is a good practice to do if you want to keep your life on track.

As for me, I will try my best to contact more people I know and if we can return to normal, possibly even go to the town once again. Find more people to communicate with, and try to carefully pick and choose what technology, video games, programs or apps I decide to use.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the screen usage of a typical human have significantly increased over the years, and I do not want to be hypocritical, but right now, I think I'd rather read a book than a newspaper or watch TV. My dependence for screens is very much like a drug. I do not know what do with myself one day when my computer broke and I needed to purchase a part and it has not arrived yet. I was going crazy.

There was more to life than checking my e-mail every few minutes or browsing the Web for background information to support a presentation. Sure, having access to phones and computers all the time has its benefits. For one, there are plenty of ways this digital age allows us to communicate with people across the globe, and there are also lots of ways we are able to educate people without the need for one on one contact, specially during the time of the pandemic, when it is mandatory to keep distance from other people.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, the screen usage of a typical human have significantly increased over the years, and I do not want to be hypocritical, but right now, I think I'd rather read a book than a newspaper or watch TV.

There was nothing interesting to do in my house, nor in my neighborhood, or anywhere in the town, and I became totally dependent for my entertainment. I did not want to communicate with people, because there was nothing to talk about and I was tired of it.

It's very scary.

So yeah, while I do not want humanity to go back to the Dark Ages, when there were no electrical devices invented, I do not think it will be a good idea for humanity to go through another Dark Age. And there's no denying that having all the humanities' knowledge and information at your finger tips is not a bad thing. But at the same time, aspects that you normally do not consider that's being damaged like social intelligence and the ability to remember things, are negatively impacted. Our reliance to technology has to be limited at one point, not just because it is a good practice to do if you want to keep your life on track.

As for me, I will try my best to contact more people I know and if we can return to normal, possibly even go to the town once again. Find more people to communicate with, and try to carefully pick and choose what technology, video games, programs or apps I decide to use.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

There was more to life than checking my e-mail every few minutes or browsing the Web for background information to support a presentation. Sure, having access to phones and computers all the time has its benefits. For one, there are plenty of ways this digital age allows us to communicate with people across the globe, and there are also lots of ways we are able to educate people without the need for one on one contact, specially during the time of the pandemic, when it is mandatory to keep distance from other people.

But it's definitely ruining my life. The same way how drugs overused can ruin someone's life when they're addicted to it, overly involved in computer, video games or other applications is the same. There was nothing interesting to do in my house, nor in my neighborhood, or anywhere in the town, and I became totally dependent for my entertainment. I did not want to communicate with people, because there was nothing to talk about and I was tired of it. My social intelligence and how I connect with people have become a bit damaged, only because I was left alone with this computer and now, I never know what to do with myself when I'm out in the open. It's very scary.

So yeah, while I do not want humanity to go back to the Dark Ages, when there were no electrical devices invented, I do not think it will be a good idea for humanity to go through another Dark Age. And there's no denying that having all the humanities' knowledge and information at your finger tips is not a bad thing. But at the same time, aspects that you normally do not consider that's being damaged like social intelligence and the ability to remember things, are negatively impacted. Our reliance to technology has to be limited at one point, not just because it is a good practice to do if you want to keep your life on track.

As for me, I will try my best to contact more people I know and if we can return to normal, possibly even go to the town once again. Find more people to communicate with, and try to carefully pick and choose what technology, video games, programs or apps I decide to use. Screen use will not go away any time soon, but we shouldn't be too dependent on them to the point it hurts our abilities to connect with other people.

Remember, technology was made to help us, and not ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
1604,suggestion-get,"How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?
