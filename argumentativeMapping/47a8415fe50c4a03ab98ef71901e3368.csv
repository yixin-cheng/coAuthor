Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.  However, I believe I can understand why people sometimes care more about the treatment of animals than humans, especially distant ones.    think that people care more about animals because they are more innocent than humans.
  When they look at an animal, especially a cute one, or one they have an attachment to, they don't see the animal as having brought the harm onto itself, while humans are guilty of many sins.   I also think that people care more about animals because they are more vulnerable than humans.  Despite this, in the cold light of day, we should be more concerned for our fellow humans, of any persuasion, than any animals.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.  However, I believe I can understand why people sometimes care more about the treatment of animals than humans, especially distant ones.    think that people care more about animals because they are more innocent than humans.
  When they look at an animal, especially a cute one, or one they have an attachment to, they don't see the animal as having brought the harm onto itself, while humans are guilty of many sins.   I also think that people care more about animals because they are more vulnerable than humans.  Despite this, in the cold light of day, we should be more concerned for our fellow humans, of any persuasion, than any animals.

I also think that people care more about animals because they are more vulnerable than humans.  Despite this, in the cold light of day, we should be more concerned for our fellow humans, of any persuasion, than any animals.

Despite this, in the cold light of day, we should be more concerned for our fellow humans, of any persuasion, than any animals.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.  However, I believe I can understand why people sometimes care more about the treatment of animals than humans, especially distant ones.    think that people care more about animals because they are more innocent than humans.
  When they look at an animal, especially a cute one, or one they have an attachment to, they don't see the animal as having brought the harm onto itself, while humans are guilty of many sins.   I also think that people care more about animals because they are more vulnerable than humans.  Despite this, in the cold light of day, we should be more concerned for our fellow humans, of any persuasion, than any animals.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.  However, I believe I can understand why people sometimes care more about the treatment of animals than humans, especially distant ones.    think that people care more about animals because they are more innocent than humans.
  When they look at an animal, especially a cute one, or one they have an attachment to, they don't see the animal as having brought the harm onto itself, while humans are guilty of many sins.   I also think that people care more about animals because they are more vulnerable than humans.  Despite this, in the cold light of day, we should be more concerned for our fellow humans, of any persuasion, than any animals.  Humans have much more capacity to anticipate pain, to fear the future, and suffer emotionally, in both the short and long term.  If we don't show concerns for other or species is in trouble and faces an uncertain future.  For sure, we should be concerned at the treatment of animals, but not at the expense of humans.  If we ourselves want to be treated humanely by others, we have to treat them the same.  This is at the very root of a civil society.  So, in conclusion, ",user,17,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.  However, I believe I can understand why people sometimes care more about the treatment of animals than humans, especially distant ones.    think that people care more about animals because they are more innocent than humans.
  When they look at an animal, especially a cute one, or one they have an attachment to, they don't see the animal as having brought the harm onto itself, while humans are guilty of many sins.   I also think that people care more about animals because they are more vulnerable than humans.  Despite this, in the cold light of day, we should be more concerned for our fellow humans, of any persuasion, than any animals.  Humans have much more capacity to anticipate pain, to fear the future, and suffer emotionally, in both the short and long term.
