In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them.

Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head.

Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head.

So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide.

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling.

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000",user,20,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life.

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide.

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring. I was never afraid of getting hurt in any sport, i was simply afraid of being in my own head.",user,21,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them.

Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring. I was never afraid of getting hurt in any sport, i was simply afraid of being in my own head. I would do anything just not to be in my own head.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring.

It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring.

Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring. I was never afraid of getting hurt in any sport, i was simply afraid of being in my own head. I would do anything just not to be in my own head.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling.

I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring. I was never afraid of getting hurt in any sport, i was simply afraid of being in my own head. I would do anything just not to be in my own head. So i definitely get the person that is doing mountain climbing for peace of mind and for that adrenaline rush that some of us so desperately need. That rush that we can not get outside of the sport.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring. I was never afraid of getting hurt in any sport, i was simply afraid of being in my own head. I would do anything just not to be in my own head.

Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring. I was never afraid of getting hurt in any sport, i was simply afraid of being in my own head. I would do anything just not to be in my own head. So i definitely get the person that is doing mountain climbing for peace of mind and for that adrenaline rush that some of us so desperately need. That rush that we can not get outside of the sport. I think that is why we do it. I think that is why we do anything, for that positive feeling or co",user,26,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring. I was never afraid of getting hurt in any sport, i was simply afraid of being in my own head. I would do anything just not to be in my own head. So i definitely get the person that is doing mountain climbing for peace of mind and for that adrenaline rush that some of us so desperately need. That rush that we can not get outside of the sport.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring. I was never afraid of getting hurt in any sport, i was simply afraid of being in my own head. I would do anything just not to be in my own head.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring. I was never afraid of getting hurt in any sport, i was simply afraid of being in my own head. I would do anything just not to be in my own head. So i definitely get the person that is doing mountain climbing for peace of mind and for that adrenaline rush that some of us so desperately need. That rush that we can not get outside of the sport.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring. I was never afraid of getting hurt in any sport, i was simply afraid of being in my own head. I would do anything just not to be in my own head.

I was never afraid of getting hurt in any sport, i was simply afraid of being in my own head. I would do anything just not to be in my own head. So i definitely get the person that is doing mountain climbing for peace of mind and for that adrenaline rush that some of us so desperately need. That rush that we can not get outside of the sport. I think that is why we do it. I think that is why we do anything, for that positive feeling or consequence. Doing it in that way is not selfish at all, it is almost selfless i.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling.

I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring.

I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring. I was never afraid of getting hurt in any sport, i was simply afraid of being in my own head. I would do anything just not to be in my own head. So i definitely get the person that is doing mountain climbing for peace of mind and for that adrenaline rush that some of us so desperately need. That rush that we can not get outside of the sport. I think that is why we do it. I think that is why we do anything, for that positive feeling or consequence. Doing it in that way is not selfish at all, it is almo.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22.

I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring. I was never afraid of getting hurt in any sport, i was simply afraid of being in my own head. I would do anything just not to be in my own head. So i definitely get the person that is doing mountain climbing for peace of mind and for that adrenaline rush that some of us so desperately need. That rush that we can not get outside of the sport.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide.

It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring. I was never afraid of getting hurt in any sport, i was simply afraid of being in my own head. I would do anything just not to be in my own head. So i definitely get the person that is doing mountain climbing for peace of mind and for that adrenaline rush that some of us so desperately need. That rush that we can not get outside of the sport. I think that is why we do it. I think that is why we do anything, for that positive feeling or consequence. Doing it in that way is not selfish at all, it is selfless.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it.

Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring. I was never afraid of getting hurt in any sport, i was simply afraid of being in my own head. I would do anything just not to be in my own head. So i definitely get the person that is doing mountain climbing for peace of mind and for that adrenaline rush that some of us so desperately need. That rush that we can not get outside of the sport. I think that is why we do it. I think that is why we do anything, for that positive feeling or consequence. Doing it in that way is not selfish at all, it is selfless. So in conclusion, i truly believe that it ",user,28,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring. I was never afraid of getting hurt in any sport, i was simply afraid of being in my own head. I would do anything just not to be in my own head. So i definitely get the person that is doing mountain climbing for peace of mind and for that adrenaline rush that some of us so desperately need. That rush that we can not get outside of the sport. I think that is why we do it. I think that is why we do anything, for that positive feeling or consequence. Doing it in that way is not selfish at all, it is selfless.

I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring. I was never afraid of getting hurt in any sport, i was simply afraid of being in my own head. I would do anything just not to be in my own head.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general.

Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring. I was never afraid of getting hurt in any sport, i was simply afraid of being in my own head. I would do anything just not to be in my own head. So i definitely get the person that is doing mountain climbing for peace of mind and for that adrenaline rush that some of us so desperately need. That rush that we can not get outside of the sport. I think that is why we do it. I think that is why we do anything, for that positive feeling or consequence. Doing it in that way is not selfish at all, it is selfless.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life.

Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring. I was never afraid of getting hurt in any sport, i was simply afraid of being in my own head. I would do anything just not to be in my own head. So i definitely get the person that is doing mountain climbing for peace of mind and for that adrenaline rush that some of us so desperately need. That rush that we can not get outside of the sport. I think that is why we do it. I think that is why we do anything, for that positive feeling or consequence. Doing it in that way is not selfish at all, it is selfless.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?
