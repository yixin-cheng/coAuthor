Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Paying college athletes ensures that if their career meets a catastrophic end, they are paid enough to partially compensate them for the risks they took. Because their college have been profiting handsomely from their efforts. College football has a $1.25 billion annual haul. And the players deserve a piece of that huge pie.

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Paying college athletes ensures that if their career meets a catastrophic end, they are paid enough to partially compensate them for the risks they took. Because their college have been profiting handsomely from their efforts. College football has a $1.25 billion annual haul. And the players deserve a piece of that huge pie.

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Paying college athletes ensures that if their career meets a catastrophic end, they are paid enough to partially compensate them for the risks they took. Because their college have been profiting handsomely from their efforts. College football has a $1.25 billion annual haul. And the players deserve a piece of that huge pie.

Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Paying college athletes ensures that if their career meets a catastrophic end, they are paid enough to partially compensate them for the risks they took. Because their college have been profiting handsomely from their efforts. College football has a $1.25 billion annual haul. And the players deserve a piece of that huge pie. They have made it possible.

Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Paying college athletes ensures that if their career meets a catastrophic end, they are paid enough to partially compensate them for the risks they took.

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Paying college athletes ensures that if their career meets a catastrophic end, they are paid enough to partially compensate them for the risks they took. Because their college have been profiting handsomely from their efforts. College football has a $1.25 billion annual haul. And the players deserve a piece of that huge pie.

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Paying college athletes ensures that if their career meets a catastrophic end, they are paid enough to partially compensate them for the risks they took. Because their college have been profiting handsomely from their efforts. College football has a $1.25 billion annual haul. And the players deserve a piece of that huge pie.

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Paying college athletes ensures that if their career meets a catastrophic end, they are paid enough to partially compensate them for the risks they took. Because their college have been profiting handsomely from their efforts. College football has a $1.25 billion annual haul. And the players deserve a piece of that huge pie.

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Paying college athletes ensures that if their career meets a catastrophic end, they are paid enough to partially compensate them for the risks they took.

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Paying college athletes ensures that if their career meets a catastrophic end, they are paid enough to partially compensate them for the risks they took.

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences.

It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing.

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing.

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Paying college athletes ensures that if their career meets a catastrophic end, they are paid enough to partially compensate them for the risks they took. Because their college have been profiting handsomely from their efforts. College football has a $1.25 billion annual haul. And the players deserve a piece of that huge pie.

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Paying college athletes ensures that if their career meets a catastrophic end, they are paid enough to partially compensate them for the risks they took. Because their college have been profiting handsomely from their efforts. College football has a $1.25 billion annual haul. And the players deserve a piece of that huge pie. They have made it possible.

It's true they may get a diploma, but first, not all of them do, and second, very few players were were recruited because of their academic prowess. They probably joined the college football team just to be on a sports team. And so the rewards they receive should come from the sports program of which they are a part.
Quite simply, our colleges have recognized the value of these players and have made them into valuable commodities.
 So why not pay them?

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Paying college athletes ensures that if their career meets a catastrophic end, they are paid enough to partially compensate them for the risks they took. Because their college have been profiting handsomely from their efforts. College football has a $1.25 billion annual haul. And the players deserve a piece of that huge pie. They have made it possible.

It's true they may get a diploma, but first, not all of them do, and second, very few players were were recruited because of their academic prowess. They probably joined the college football team just to be on a sports team. And so the rewards they receive should come from the sports program of which they are a part.
Quite simply, our colleges have recognized the value of these players and have made them into valuable commodities.
 So why not pay them?

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Paying college athletes ensures that if their career meets a catastrophic end, they are paid enough to partially compensate them for the risks they took.

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Paying college athletes ensures that if their career meets a catastrophic end, they are paid enough to partially compensate them for the risks they took. Because their college have been profiting handsomely from their efforts. College football has a $1.25 billion annual haul. And the players deserve a piece of that huge pie. They have made it possible.

It's true they may get a diploma, but first, not all of them do, and second, very few players were were recruited because of their academic prowess. They probably joined the college football team just to be on a sports team. And so the rewards they receive should come from the sports program of which they are a part.
Quite simply, our colleges have recognized the value of these players and have made them into valuable commodities.

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Paying college athletes ensures that if their career meets a catastrophic end, they are paid enough to partially compensate them for the risks they took. Because their college have been profiting handsomely from their efforts. College football has a $1.25 billion annual haul. And the players deserve a piece of that huge pie. They have made it possible.

It's true they may get a diploma, but first, not all of them do, and second, very few players were were recruited because of their academic prowess. They probably joined the college football team just to be on a sports team. And so the rewards they receive should come from the sports program of which they are a part.

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Paying college athletes ensures that if their career meets a catastrophic end, they are paid enough to partially compensate them for the risks they took. Because their college have been profiting handsomely from their efforts. College football has a $1.25 billion annual haul. And the players deserve a piece of that huge pie. They have made it possible.

It's true they may get a diploma, but first, not all of them do, and second, very few players were were recruited because of their academic prowess. They probably joined the college football team just to be on a sports team. And so the rewards they receive should come from the sports program of which they are a part.
Quite simply, our colleges have recognized the value of these players and have made them into valuable commodities.
 So why not pay them?

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Paying college athletes ensures that if their career meets a catastrophic end, they are paid enough to partially compensate them for the risks they took. Because their college have been profiting handsomely from their efforts. College football has a $1.25 billion annual haul. And the players deserve a piece of that huge pie. They have made it possible.

It's true they may get a diploma, but first, not all of them do, and second, very few players were were recruited because of their academic prowess. They probably joined the college football team just to be on a sports team. And so the rewards they receive should come from the sports program of which they are a part.
Quite simply, our colleges have recognized the value of these players and have made them into valuable commodities.

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Paying college athletes ensures that if their career meets a catastrophic end, they are paid enough to partially compensate them for the risks they took. Because their college have been profiting handsomely from their efforts. College football has a $1.25 billion annual haul. And the players deserve a piece of that huge pie. They have made it possible.

It's true they may get a diploma, but first, not all of them do, and second, very few players were were recruited because of their academic prowess. They probably joined the college football team just to be on a sports team. And so the rewards they receive should come from the sports program of which they are a part.
Quite simply, our colleges have recognized the value of these players and have made them into valuable commodities.

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Paying college athletes ensures that if their career meets a catastrophic end, they are paid enough to partially compensate them for the risks they took. Because their college have been profiting handsomely from their efforts. College football has a $1.25 billion annual haul. And the players deserve a piece of that huge pie. They have made it possible.

It's true they may get a diploma, but first, not all of them do, and second, very few players were were recruited because of their academic prowess. They probably joined the college football team just to be on a sports team. And so the rewards they receive should come from the sports program of which they are a part.
Quite simply, our colleges have recognized the value of these players and have made them into valuable commodities.

McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Paying college athletes ensures that if their career meets a catastrophic end, they are paid enough to partially compensate them for the risks they took. Because their college have been profiting handsomely from their efforts. College football has a $1.25 billion annual haul. And the players deserve a piece of that huge pie. They have made it possible.

It's true they may get a diploma, but first, not all of them do, and second, very few players were were recruited because of their academic prowess. They probably joined the college football team just to be on a sports team. And so the rewards they receive should come from the sports program of which they are a part.
Quite simply, our colleges have recognized the value of these players and have made them into valuable commodities.
 So why not pay them?
