In my opinion, the most important things that students should learn in school are writing, science, and reading. These are building blocks to a good solid education. Reading and writing are essential to effective communication and a solid understanding of grammar and syntax. And without science, we would all have no idea about why things are the way they are. Learning about science helps us understand our world and how things work.  These skills ensure our survival and reduce our dependency on new technology, thus preserving our natural intelligence.  People that can communicate their thoughts and ideas are also able to document their findings and discoveries. Without writing and science our society would not benefit from these important contributors to our society and culture. These elements are how archaeologists are able to learn about past civilizations and how researchers can learn about what we have recently discovered. I believe that this knowledge will help us further our understanding of the universe and the people around us.

In my opinion, the most important things that students should learn in school are writing, science, and reading. These are building blocks to a good solid education. Reading and writing are essential to effective communication and a solid understanding of grammar and syntax. And without science, we would all have no idea about why things are the way they are. Learning about science helps us understand our world and how things work.  These skills ensure our survival and reduce our dependency on new technology, thus preserving our natural intelligence.  People that can communicate their thoughts and ideas are also able to document their findings and discoveries. Without writing and science our society would not benefit from these important contributors to our society and culture. These elements are how archaeologists are able to learn about past civilizations and how researchers can learn about what we have recently discovered. I believe that this knowledge will help us further our understanding of the universe and the people around us. This is why it is important to introduce basic reading and writing and science skills as early as possible. They are key to the success and survival of our future and are part of everyday life.
