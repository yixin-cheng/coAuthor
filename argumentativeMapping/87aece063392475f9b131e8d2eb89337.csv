Extreme sports, while dangerous, are often well-known by its participants and understood regarding the dangers they might face. Many people would not undertake a severe mountain climb, if they are not prepared to do so. Other sports that involve risk, such as downhill cycling, occur in areas that the participants are probably more familiar and comfortable with, for example, at an area they train or practice in. Like other sports, extreme sports require effort and time from its athletes, who take the initiative to train themselves to meet the demands of the sport. For many, extreme sports possess benefits and aspects of it that are not as easily obtained in regular sports, that motivates select individuals to pursue them as hobbies.

 Those that accomplish great feats in extreme sports can have their achievements recorded for others to hear about, which might motivate them as well as others to continue to achieve their aspirations and goals. While the stakes may be higher, extreme sports are still considered a sport because they require the same amount of training and time as other sports would for an athlete to achieve such feats. Thus, I doubt their is a universal standard to deem sports as too dangerous to pursue, given that for some, pursuing a sport would be too dangerous and risky, while for others it would be a worthwhile use of their time.

Extreme sports, while dangerous, are often well-known by its participants and understood regarding the dangers they might face. Many people would not undertake a severe mountain climb, if they are not prepared to do so.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Extreme sports, while dangerous, are often well-known by its participants and understood regarding the dangers they might face. Many people would not undertake a severe mountain climb, if they are not prepared to do so. Other sports that involve risk, such as downhill cycling, occur in areas that the participants are probably more familiar and comfortable with, for example, at an area they train or practice in. Like other sports, extreme sports require effort and time from its athletes, who take the initiative to train themselves to meet the demands of the sport. For many, extreme sports possess benefits and aspects of it that are not as easily obtained in regular sports, that motivates select individuals to pursue them as hobbies.
The spirit of physical exertion and camaraderie that many extreme sport preserves myre a ositive aspects of the sport.
 Those that accomplish great feats in extreme sports can have their achievements recorded for others to hear about, which might motivate them as well as others to continue to achieve their aspirations and goals. While the stakes may be higher, extreme sports are still considered a sport because they require the same amount of training and time as other sports would for an athlete to achieve such feats. Thus, I doubt their is a universal standard to deem sports as too dangerous to pursue, given that for some, pursuing a sport would be too dangerous and risky, while for others it would be a worthwhile use of their time. 

I think it would be against the spirit of sport to outright prohibit such sports due to potential risks of injury. Many sports that are not considered to be extreme sports are also dangerous and could cause injury to the user. These sports are well observed, and many take the requisite precautions to reduce the frequency and severity of injuries. This is done through proper training, physical prowess, and more.

Extreme sports, while dangerous, are often well-known by its participants and understood regarding the dangers they might face. Many people would not undertake a severe mountain climb, if they are not prepared to do so. Other sports that involve risk, such as downhill cycling, occur in areas that the participants are probably more familiar and comfortable with, for example, at an area they train or practice in. Like other sports, extreme sports require effort and time from its athletes, who take the initiative to train themselves to meet the demands of the sport. For many, extreme sports possess benefits and aspects of it that are not as easily obtained in regular sports, that motivates select individuals to pursue them as hobbies.
The spirit of physical exertion and camaraderie that many extreme sport preserves myre a ositive aspects of the sport.
 Those that accomplish great feats in extreme sports can have their achievements recorded for others to hear about, which might motivate them as well as others to continue to achieve their aspirations and goals. While the stakes may be higher, extreme sports are still considered a sport because they require the same amount of training and time as other sports would for an athlete to achieve such feats. Thus, I doubt their is a universal standard to deem sports as too dangerous to pursue, given that for some, pursuing a sport would be too dangerous and risky, while for others it would be a worthwhile use of their time. 

I think it would be against the spirit of sport to outright prohibit such sports due to potential risks of injury. Many sports that are not considered to be extreme sports are also dangerous and could cause injury to the user.

Extreme sports, while dangerous, are often well-known by its participants and understood regarding the dangers they might face.

I think it would be against the spirit of sport to outright prohibit such sports due to potential risks of injury. Many sports that are not considered to be extreme sports are also dangerous and could cause injury to the user.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---
Extreme sports, while dangerous, are often well-known by its participants and understood regarding the dangers they might face. Many people would not undertake a severe mountain climb, if they are not prepared to do so. Other sports that involve risk, such as downhill cycling, occur in areas that the participants are probably more familiar and comfortable with, for example, at an area they train or practice in. Like other sports, extreme sports require effort and time from its athletes, who take the initiative to train themselves to meet the demands of the sport. For many, extreme sports possess benefits and aspects of it that are not as easily obtained in regular sports, that motivates select individuals to pursue them as hobbies.
The spirit of physical exertion and camaraderie that many extreme sport preserves myre a ositive aspects of the sport.
 Those that accomplish great feats in extreme sports can have their achievements recorded for others to hear about, which might motivate them as well as others to continue to achieve their aspirations and goals. While the stakes may be higher, extreme sports are still considered a sport because they require the same amount of training and time as other sports would for an athlete to achieve such feats. Thus, I doubt their is a universal standard to deem sports as too dangerous to pursue, given that for some, pursuing a sport would be too dangerous and risky, while for others it would be a worthwhile use of their time. 

I think it would be against the spirit of sport to outright prohibit such sports due to potential risks of injury. Many sports that are not considered to be extreme sports are also dangerous and could cause injury to the user. These sports are well observed, and many take the requisite precautions to reduce the frequency and severity of injuries. This is done through proper training, physical prowess, and more. Just like how someone that is inexperienced can injury themselves more often than a professional in a sport, so too can a person put themselves at risk while doing an extreme sport that they are not familiar with. Te safety of some extreme sports could arguably be improved, and more precautions taken to reduce the risk of injury and death.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---
Extreme sports, while dangerous, are often well-known by its participants and understood regarding the dangers they might face. Many people would not undertake a severe mountain climb, if they are not prepared to do so. Other sports that involve risk, such as downhill cycling, occur in areas that the participants are probably more familiar and comfortable with, for example, at an area they train or practice in. Like other sports, extreme sports require effort and time from its athletes, who take the initiative to train themselves to meet the demands of the sport. For many, extreme sports possess benefits and aspects of it that are not as easily obtained in regular sports, that motivates select individuals to pursue them as hobbies.
The spirit of physical exertion and camaraderie that many extreme sport preserves myre a ositive aspects of the sport.
 Those that accomplish great feats in extreme sports can have their achievements recorded for others to hear about, which might motivate them as well as others to continue to achieve their aspirations and goals. While the stakes may be higher, extreme sports are still considered a sport because they require the same amount of training and time as other sports would for an athlete to achieve such feats. Thus, I doubt their is a universal standard to deem sports as too dangerous to pursue, given that for some, pursuing a sport would be too dangerous and risky, while for others it would be a worthwhile use of their time. 

I think it would be against the spirit of sport to outright prohibit such sports due to potential risks of injury. Many sports that are not considered to be extreme sports are also dangerous and could cause injury to the user. These sports are well observed, and many take the requisite precautions to reduce the frequency and severity of injuries. This is done through proper training, physical prowess, and more.

Thus, I doubt their is a universal standard to deem sports as too dangerous to pursue, given that for some, pursuing a sport would be too dangerous and risky, while for others it would be a worthwhile use of their time. 

I think it would be against the spirit of sport to outright prohibit such sports due to potential risks of injury. Many sports that are not considered to be extreme sports are also dangerous and could cause injury to the user. These sports are well observed, and many take the requisite precautions to reduce the frequency and severity of injuries. This is done through proper training, physical prowess, and more.

Other sports that involve risk, such as downhill cycling, occur in areas that the participants are probably more familiar and comfortable with, for example, at an area they train or practice in. Like other sports, extreme sports require effort and time from its athletes, who take the initiative to train themselves to meet the demands of the sport. For many, extreme sports possess benefits and aspects of it that are not as easily obtained in regular sports, that motivates select individuals to pursue them as hobbies.
The spirit of physical exertion and camaraderie that many extreme sport preserves myre a ositive aspects of the sport.
 Those that accomplish great feats in extreme sports can have their achievements recorded for others to hear about, which might motivate them as well as others to continue to achieve their aspirations and goals. While the stakes may be higher, extreme sports are still considered a sport because they require the same amount of training and time as other sports would for an athlete to achieve such feats. Thus, I doubt their is a universal standard to deem sports as too dangerous to pursue, given that for some, pursuing a sport would be too dangerous and risky, while for others it would be a worthwhile use of their time. 

I think it would be against the spirit of sport to outright prohibit such sports due to potential risks of injury. Many sports that are not considered to be extreme sports are also dangerous and could cause injury to the user. These sports are well observed, and many take the requisite precautions to reduce the frequency and severity of injuries. This is done through proper training, physical prowess, and more.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Extreme sports, while dangerous, are often well-known by its participants and understood regarding the dangers they might face. Many people would not undertake a severe mountain climb, if they are not prepared to do so. Other sports that involve risk, such as downhill cycling, occur in areas that the participants are probably more familiar and comfortable with, for example, at an area they train or practice in. Like other sports, extreme sports require effort and time from its athletes, who take the initiative to train themselves to meet the demands of the sport. For many, extreme sports possess benefits and aspects of it that are not as easily obtained in regular sports, that motivates select individuals to pursue them as hobbies.
The spirit of physical exertion and camaraderie that many extreme sport preserves myre a ositive aspects of the sport.
 Those that accomplish great feats in extreme sports can have their achievements recorded for others to hear about, which might motivate them as well as others to continue to achieve their aspirations and goals. While the stakes may be higher, extreme sports are still considered a sport because they require the same amount of training and time as other sports would for an athlete to achieve such feats. Thus, I doubt their is a universal standard to deem sports as too dangerous to pursue, given that for some, pursuing a sport would be too dangerous and risky, while for others it would be a worthwhile use of their time. 

I think it would be against the spirit of sport to outright prohibit such sports due to potential risks of injury. Many sports that are not considered to be extreme sports are also dangerous and could cause injury to the user. These sports are well observed, and many take the requisite precautions to reduce the frequency and severity of injuries. This is done through proper training, physical prowess, and more.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Extreme sports, while dangerous, are often well-known by its participants and understood regarding the dangers they might face. Many people would not undertake a severe mountain climb, if they are not prepared to do so. Other sports that involve risk, such as downhill cycling, occur in areas that the participants are probably more familiar and comfortable with, for example, at an area they train or practice in. Like other sports, extreme sports require effort and time from its athletes, who take the initiative to train themselves to meet the demands of the sport. For many, extreme sports possess benefits and aspects of it that are not as easily obtained in regular sports, that motivates select individuals to pursue them as hobbies.
The spirit of physical exertion and camaraderie that many extreme sport preserves myre a ositive aspects of the sport.
 Those that accomplish great feats in extreme sports can have their achievements recorded for others to hear about, which might motivate them as well as others to continue to achieve their aspirations and goals. While the stakes may be higher, extreme sports are still considered a sport because they require the same amount of training and time as other sports would for an athlete to achieve such feats. Thus, I doubt their is a universal standard to deem sports as too dangerous to pursue, given that for some, pursuing a sport would be too dangerous and risky, while for others it would be a worthwhile use of their time. 

I think it would be against the spirit of sport to outright prohibit such sports due to potential risks of injury. Many sports that are not considered to be extreme sports are also dangerous and could cause injury to the user. These sports are well observed, and many take the requisite precautions to reduce the frequency and severity of injuries. This is done through proper training, physical prowess, and more. Just like how someone that is inexperienced can injury themselves more often than a professional in a sport, so too can a person put themselves at risk while doing an extreme sport that they are not familiar with.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Extreme sports, while dangerous, are often well-known by its participants and understood regarding the dangers they might face. Many people would not undertake a severe mountain climb, if they are not prepared to do so. Other sports that involve risk, such as downhill cycling, occur in areas that the participants are probably more familiar and comfortable with, for example, at an area they train or practice in. Like other sports, extreme sports require effort and time from its athletes, who take the initiative to train themselves to meet the demands of the sport. For many, extreme sports possess benefits and aspects of it that are not as easily obtained in regular sports, that motivates select individuals to pursue them as hobbies.

 Those that accomplish great feats in extreme sports can have their achievements recorded for others to hear about, which might motivate them as well as others to continue to achieve their aspirations and goals. While the stakes may be higher, extreme sports are still considered a sport because they require the same amount of training and time as other sports would for an athlete to achieve such feats. Thus, I doubt their is a universal standard to deem sports as too dangerous to pursue, given that for some, pursuing a sport would be too dangerous and risky, while for others it would be a worthwhile use of their time. 

I think it would be against the spirit of sport to outright prohibit such sports due to potential risks of injury.

Extreme sports, while dangerous, are often well-known by its participants and understood regarding the dangers they might face. Many people would not undertake a severe mountain climb, if they are not prepared to do so. Other sports that involve risk, such as downhill cycling, occur in areas that the participants are probably more familiar and comfortable with, for example, at an area they train or practice in. Like other sports, extreme sports require effort and time from its athletes, who take the initiative to train themselves to meet the demands of the sport. For many, extreme sports possess benefits and aspects of it that are not as easily obtained in regular sports, that motivates select individuals to pursue them as hobbies.
The spirit of physical exertion and camaraderie that many extreme sport preserves myre a ositive aspects of the sport.
 Those that accomplish great feats in extreme sports can have their achievements recorded for others to hear about, which might motivate them as well as others to continue to achieve their aspirations and goals. While the stakes may be higher, extreme sports are still considered a sport because they require the same amount of training and time as other sports would for an athlete to achieve such feats. Thus, I doubt their is a universal standard to deem sports as too dangerous to pursue, given that for some, pursuing a sport would be too dangerous and risky, while for others it would be a worthwhile use of their time. 

I think it would be against the spirit of sport to outright prohibit such sports due to potential risks of injury. Many sports that are not considered to be extreme sports are also dangerous and could cause injury to the user. These sports are well observed, and many take the requisite precautions to reduce the frequency and severity of injuries. This is done through proper training, physical prowess, and more. Just like how someone that is inexperienced can injury themselves more often than a professional in a sport, so too can a person put themselves at risk while doing an extreme sport that they are not familiar with.
