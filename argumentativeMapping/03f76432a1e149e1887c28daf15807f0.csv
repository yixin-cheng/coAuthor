This is a character who is there to help the white protagonist, but has no real purpose in the story. They don't really have any character development. They're just there to help the white person. 

They're the janitor or the black man who has just been in jail.  They're the girl next door with no perThey the weird gay friend who lusts after the main character.

 I'm saying that when they are written well, they are not offensive.  It's the lazy writing, the way these characters exist only to help the white (often male) star of the show, and don't exist as people themselves.  It's the way they are only there to be the ""other."" 

I don't think I would ever natch or read something bshallow like this, ecause of its offensive portrayal of someone.
 I would rather read or watch something that is well-written and has a diverse cast of characters.  Well-rounded characters, who are there for a reason.

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is the ""magical negro.""  Yes, that is a real term, for a common trope. This is a character who is there to help the white protagonist, but has no real purpose in the story. They don't really have any character development. They're just there to help the white person. 

They're the janitor or the black man who has just been in jail.  They're the girl next door with no personality of her own, who adores the protaganist for They the weird gay friend who lusts after the main character. 
I also don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" person of color.
 This is a character who is there to represent the race, but doesn't really have any other purpose. They're just there to be the ""other"" person.  don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" woman.

 I'm saying that when they are written well, they are not offensive.  It's the lazy writing, the way these characters exist only to help the white (often male) star of the show, and don't exist as people themselves.  It's the way they are only there to be the ""other."" 

I don't think I would ever natch or read something bshallow like this, ecause of its offensive portrayal of someone.
 I would rather read or watch something that is well-written and has a diverse cast of characters.  Well-rounded characters, who are there for a reason.

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is the ""magical negro.""  Yes, that is a real term, for a common trope. This is a character who is there to help the white protagonist, but has no real purpose in the story. They don't really have any character development. They're just there to help the white person, to be the ""other"" person.

They're the janitor or the black man who has just been in jail.  They're the girl next door with no personality of her own, who adores the protagonist for no good reason. They're the weird gay friend who lusts after the main character.

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is the ""magical negro.""  Yes, that is a real term, for a common trope. This is a character who is there to help the white protagonist, but has no real purpose in the story. They don't really have any character development. They're just there to help the white person, to be the ""other"" person.

They're the janitor or the black man who has just been in jail.  They're the girl next door with no personality of her own, who adores the protagonist for no good reason. They're the weird gay friend who lusts after the main character.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is the ""magical negro.""  Yes, that is a real term, for a common trope. This is a character who is there to help the white protagonist, but has no real purpose in the story. They don't really have any character development. They're just there to help the white person, to be the ""other"" person.

They're the janitor or the black man who has just been in jail.  They're the girl next door with no personality of her own, who adores the protagonist for no good reason. They're the weird gay friend who lusts after the main character. 
I also don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" person of color.
   don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" woman.
 I don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" gay person. I don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" disabled person. 
I don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" anything.
 'm not saying that these characters can't be written well.
 I'm saying that when they are written well, they are not offensive.  It's the lazy writing, the way these characters exist only to help the white (often male) star of the show, and don't exist as people themselves.  It's the way they are only there to be the ""other."" 

I don't think I would ever natch or read something bshallow like this, ecause of its offensive portrayal of someone.
 I would rather read or watch something that is well-written and has a diverse cast of characters.  We need well-rounded characters, who are there for a reason.

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is the ""magical negro.""  Yes, that is a real term, for a common trope. This is a character who is there to help the white protagonist, but has no real purpose in the story. They don't really have any character development. They're just there to help the white person, to be the ""other"" person.

They're the janitor or the black man who has just been in jail.  They're the girl next door with no personality of her own, who adores the protagonist for no good reason. They're the weird gay friend who lusts after the main character.

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is the ""magical negro.""  Yes, that is a real term, for a common trope. This is a character who is there to help the white protagonist, but has no real purpose in the story. They don't really have any character development. They're just there to help the white person, to be the ""other"" person.

They're the janitor or the black man who has just been in jail.  They're the girl next door with no personality of her own, who adores the protagonist for no good reason. They're the weird gay friend who lusts after the main character.

This is a character who is there to help the white protagonist, but has no real purpose in the story. They don't really have any character development. They're just there to help the white person, to be the ""other"" person.

They're the janitor or the black man who has just been in jail.  They're the girl next door with no personality of her own, who adores the protagonist for no good reason. They're the weird gay friend who lusts after the main character. 
I also don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" person of color.
   don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" woman.
 I don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" gay person. I don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" disabled person.

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is the ""magical negro.""  Yes, that is a real term, for a common trope. This is a character who is there to help the white protagonist, but has no real purpose in the story. They don't really have any character development. They're just there to help the white person, to be the ""other"" person.

They're the janitor or the black man who has just been in jail.  They're the girl next door with no personality of her own, who adores the protagonist for no good reason. They're the weird gay friend who lusts after the main character.

This is a character who is there to help the white protagonist, but has no real purpose in the story. They don't really have any character development. They're just there to help the white person, to be the ""other"" person.

They're the janitor or the black man who has just been in jail.  They're the girl next door with no personality of her own, who adores the protagonist for no good reason. They're the weird gay friend who lusts after the main character. 
I also don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" person of color.
   don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" woman.
 I don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" gay person. I don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" disabled person. 
I don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" anything.
 'm not saying that these characters can't be written well.
 I'm saying that when they are written well, they are not offensive.  It's the lazy writing, the way these characters exist only to help the white (often male) star of the show, and don't exist as people themselves.  It's the way they are only there to be the ""other."" 

I don't think I would ever natch or read something bshallow like this, ecause of its offensive portrayal of someone.
 I would rather read or watch something that is well-written and has a diverse cast of characters-they can be any color they want.

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is the ""magical negro.""  Yes, that is a real term, for a common trope. This is a character who is there to help the white protagonist, but has no real purpose in the story. They don't really have any character development. They're just there to help the white person, to be the ""other"" person.

They're the janitor or the black man who has just been in jail.  They're the girl next door with no personality of her own, who adores the protagonist for no good reason. They're the weird gay friend who lusts after the main character.

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is the ""magical negro.""  Yes, that is a real term, for a common trope. This is a character who is there to help the white protagonist, but has no real purpose in the story. They don't really have any character development. They're just there to help the white person, to be the ""other"" person.

They're the janitor or the black man who has just been in jail.  They're the girl next door with no personality of her own, who adores the protagonist for no good reason. They're the weird gay friend who lusts after the main character.

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is the ""magical negro.""  Yes, that is a real term, for a common trope. This is a character who is there to help the white protagonist, but has no real purpose in the story. They don't really have any character development. They're just there to help the white person, to be the ""other"" person.

They're the janitor or the black man who has just been in jail.  They're the girl next door with no personality of her own, who adores the protagonist for no good reason. They're the weird gay friend who lusts after the main character.

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is the ""magical negro.""  Yes, that is a real term, for a common trope. This is a character who is there to help the white protagonist, but has no real purpose in the story. They don't really have any character development. They're just there to help the white person, to be the ""other"" person.

They're the janitor or the black man who has just been in jail.  They're the girl next door with no personality of her own, who adores the protagonist for no good reason. They're the weird gay friend who lusts after the main character.

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is the ""magical negro.""  Yes, that is a real term, for a common trope. This is a character who is there to help the white protagonist, but has no real purpose in the story. They don't really have any character development. They're just there to help the white person, to be the ""other"" person.

They're the janitor or the black man who has just been in jail.  They're the girl next door with no personality of her own, who adores the protagonist for no good reason. They're the weird gay friend who lusts after the main character. 
I also don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" person of color.
   don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" woman.
 I don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" gay person. I don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" disabled person. 
I don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" anything.
 'm not saying that these characters can't be written well.
 I'm saying that when they are written well, they are not offensive.  It's the lazy writing, the way these characters exist only to help the white (often male) star of the show, and don't exist as people themselves.  It's the way they are only there to be the ""other.""

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is the ""magical negro.""  Yes, that is a real term, for a common trope. This is a character who is there to help the white protagonist, but has no real purpose in the story. They don't really have any character development. They're just there to help the white person, to be the ""other"" person.

They're the janitor or the black man who has just been in jail.  They're the girl next door with no personality of her own, who adores the protagonist for no good reason. They're the weird gay friend who lusts after the main character. 
I also don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" person of color.
   don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" woman.
 I don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" gay person. I don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" disabled person. 
I don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" anything.
 'm not saying that these characters can't be written well.
 I'm saying that when they are written well, they are not offensive.  It's the lazy writing, the way these characters exist only to help the white (often male) star of the show, and don't exist as people themselves.  It's the way they are only there to be the ""other.""

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is the ""magical negro.""  Yes, that is a real term, for a common trope. This is a character who is there to help the white protagonist, but has no real purpose in the story. They don't really have any character development. They're just there to help the white person, to be the ""other"" person.

They're the janitor or the black man who has just been in jail.  They're the girl next door with no personality of her own, who adores the protagonist for no good reason. They're the weird gay friend who lusts after the main character. 
I also don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" person of color.
   don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" woman.
 I don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" gay person. I don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" disabled person. 
I don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" anything.
 'm not saying that these characters can't be written well.
 I'm saying that when they are written well, they are not offensive.  It's the lazy writing, the way these characters exist only to help the white (often male) star of the show, and don't exist as people themselves.  It's the way they are only there to be the ""other.""

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is the ""magical negro.""  Yes, that is a real term, for a common trope. This is a character who is there to help the white protagonist, but has no real purpose in the story. They don't really have any character development.

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is the ""magical negro.""  Yes, that is a real term, for a common trope. This is a character who is there to help the white protagonist, but has no real purpose in the story. They don't really have any character development. They're just there to help the white person, to be the ""other"" person.

They're the janitor or the black man who has just been in jail.  They're the girl next door with no personality of her own, who adores the protagonist for no good reason. They're the weird gay friend who lusts after the main character.

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is the ""magical negro.""  Yes, that is a real term, for a common trope. This is a character who is there to help the white protagonist, but has no real purpose in the story. They don't really have any character development. They're just there to help the white person, to be the ""other"" person.

They're the janitor or the black man who has just been in jail.  They're the girl next door with no personality of her own, who adores the protagonist for no good reason. They're the weird gay friend who lusts after the main character.

   don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" woman.
 I don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" gay person. I don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" disabled person.  don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" anything.
 

'm not saying that these characters can't be written well.
 I'm saying that when they are written well, they are not offensive.  It's the lazy writing, the way these characters exist only to help the white (often male) star of the show, and don't exist as people themselves.  It's the way they are only there to be the ""other"" person, watching the hero from the outside.
I don't think I would ever natch or read something bshallow like this, ecause of its offensive portrayal of someone.
 I would rather read or watch something that is well-written and has a diverse cast of characters-they can be any color they want. 

We need well-rounded characters, who are there for a reason, and no more encouraging ""other"" stereotypes. We're all people, each with our own unique stories, and should be represented as such!
