What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The worst stereotypes are interracial relationships. If a black man is involved, the woman is either a cheater or there to serve as the black man's downfall. If a black woman is involved, the man is there for her to sleep with and get money from.   

It is such a tired, repetitive theme. I hate it. I can't even watch movies that give the black man a hot sister to meet as a hooker or some other profession like that, because it is just so lurid and tasteless. 

This is one of the reasons why Tyler Perry has cleaned up financially.  He has brought such amazing characters to the big screen that people are clamoring to see more of his romantic movies.  For interracial couples to be featured in books or movies, it doesn't have to be some lurid combination. It can be subtle and beautiful. 
I'd like to see different kinds of relationships represented in more depth.

The worst stereotypes are interracial relationships. If a black man is involved, the woman is either a cheater or there to serve as the black man's downfall. If a black woman is involved, the man is there for her to sleep with and get money from.   

This is one of the reasons why Tyler Perry has cleaned up financially.  He has brought such amazing characters to the big screen that people are clamoring to see more of his romantic movies.  For interracial couples to be featured in books or movies, it doesn't have to be some lurid combination. It can be subtle and beautiful. 
I'd like to see different kinds of relationships represented in more depth.
 Quirky, unique and different love stories need to be told. I'm tired of seeing only the 'usual suspects' time and again. I want to see strange couples and new stories.   

It's hard to watch/read about interracial relationships without feeling incredibly frustrated. Sometimes I think we'll never get to a place where interracial relationships are just about the relationship, not about the fact that the two people are of two different races.  It's been done very well a few times (one of my favorites is ""Empire""), but it doesn't happen enough for me. 
What irritates me is when people describe things and every time they describe the color of the person they go 'black/white,"" etc, instead ofIt is such a tired, repetitive theme. I hate it. I can't even watch movies that give the black man a hot sister to meet as a hooker or some other profession like that, because it is just so lurid and tasteless.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The worst stereotypes are interracial relationships. If a black man is involved, the woman is either a cheater or there to serve as the black man's downfall. If a black woman is involved, the man is there for her to sleep with and get money from.

The worst stereotypes are interracial relationships. If a black man is involved, the woman is either a cheater or there to serve as the black man's downfall. If a black woman is involved, the man is there for her to sleep with and get money from.

I'd like to see different kinds of relationships represented in more depth.
 Quirky, unique and different love stories need to be told. I'm tired of seeing only the 'usual suspects' time and again. I want to see strange couples and new stories.

It is such a tired, repetitive theme. I hate it. I can't even watch movies that give the black man a hot sister to meet as a hooker or some other profession like that, because it is just so lurid and tasteless.

I'd like to see different kinds of relationships represented in more depth.

It is such a tired, repetitive theme. I hate it.

I'd like to see different kinds of relationships represented in more depth.
 Quirky, unique and different love stories need to be told. I'm tired of seeing only the 'usual suspects' time and again. I want to see strange couples and new stories.   

It's hard to watch/read about interracial relationships without feeling incredibly frustrated. Sometimes I think we'll never get to a place where interracial relationships are just about the relationship, not about the fact that the two people are of two different races.  It's been done very well a few times (one of my favorites is ""Empire""), but it doesn't happen enough for me. 
What irritates me is when people describe things and every time they describe the color of the person they go 'black/white,"" etc, instead of their personal story. It is such a tired, repetitive theme. I hate it. I can't even watch movies that give the black man a hot sister to meet as a hooker or some other profession like that, because it is just so lurid and tasteless.

The worst stereotypes are interracial relationships. If a black man is involved, the woman is either a cheater or there to serve as the black man's downfall. If a black woman is involved, the man is there for her to sleep with and get money from.   

This is one of the reasons why Tyler Perry has cleaned up financially.  He has brought such amazing characters to the big screen that people are clamoring to see more of his romantic movies.  For interracial couples to be featured in books or movies, it doesn't have to be some lurid combination. It can be subtle and beautiful. People realize this, and are moving towards more accurate representation.
I'd like to see different kinds of relationships represented in more depth.
 Quirky, unique and different love stories need to be told. I'm tired of seeing only the 'usual suspects' time and again. I want to see strange couples and new stories.   

It's hard to watch/read about interracial relationships without feeling incredibly frustrated. Sometimes I think we'll never get to a place where interracial relationships are just about the relationship, not about the fact that the two people are of two different races.  It's been done very well a few times (one of my favorites is ""Empire""), but it doesn't happen enough for me. 
What irritates me is when people describe things and every time they describe the color of the person they go 'black/ browhite,"" etc, instead of their personal story. It is such a tired, repetitive theme. I hate it. I can't even watch movies that give the black man a hot sister to meet as a hooker or some other profession like that, because it is just so lurid and tasteless.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

The worst stereotypes are interracial relationships. If a black man is involved, the woman is either a cheater or there to serve as the black man's downfall. If a black woman is involved, the man is there for her to sleep with and get money from.   

This is one of the reasons why Tyler Perry has cleaned up financially.  He has brought such amazing characters to the big screen that people are clamoring to see more of his romantic movies.  For interracial couples to be featured in books or movies, it doesn't have to be some lurid combination. It can be subtle and beautiful. People realize this, and are moving towards more accurate representation.
I'd like to see different kinds of relationships represented in more depth.
 Quirky, unique and different love stories need to be told. I'm tired of seeing only the 'usual suspects' time and again. I want to see strange couples and new stories.   

It's hard to watch/read about interracial relationships without feeling incredibly frustrated. Sometimes I think we'll never get to a place where interracial relationships are just about the relationship, not about the fact that the two people are of two different races.  It's been done very well a few times (one of my favorites is ""Empire""), but it doesn't happen enough for me.

It's hard to watch/read about interracial relationships without feeling incredibly frustrated. Sometimes I think we'll never get to a place where interracial relationships are just about the relationship, not about the fact that the two people are of two different races.  It's been done very well a few times (one of my favorites is ""Empire""), but it doesn't happen enough for me. 
What irritates me is when people describe things and every time they describe the color of the person they go 'black/ brotherwhite, girl"" etc, instead of their personal story. It is such a tired, repetitive theme. I hate it. I can't even watch movies that give the black man a hot sister to meet as a hooker or some other profession like that, because it is just so lurid and tasteless.  just hate it.

The worst stereotypes are interracial relationships. If a black man is involved, the woman is either a cheater or there to serve as the black man's downfall. If a black woman is involved, the man is there for her to sleep with and get money from.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

The worst stereotypes are interracial relationships. If a black man is involved, the woman is either a cheater or there to serve as the black man's downfall. If a black woman is involved, the man is there for her to sleep with and get money from.   If it isn't like that, it is the black man who goes to jail and cheats on his white wife or is in some other way dramatically involved in a usual negative stereotype.

This is one of the reasons why Tyler Perry has cleaned up financially.  He has brought such amazing characters to the big screen that people are clamoring to see more of his romantic movies.  For interracial couples to be featured in books or movies, it doesn't have to be some lurid combination. It can be subtle and beautiful. People realize this, and are moving towards more accurate representation.
I'd like to see different kinds of relationships represented in more depth.
 Quirky, unique and different love stories need to be told. I'm tired of seeing only the 'usual suspects' time and again. I want to see strange couples and new stories.   

It's hard to watch/read about interracial relationships without feeling incredibly frustrated. Sometimes I think we'll never get to a place where interracial relationships are just about the relationship, not about the fact that the two people are of two different races.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

The worst stereotypes are interracial relationships. If a black man is involved, the woman is either a cheater or there to serve as the black man's downfall. If a black woman is involved, the man is there for her to sleep with and get money from.   If it isn't like that, it is the black man who goes to jail and cheats on his white wife with a black s or is in some other way dramatically involved in a usual negative stereotype.

This is one of the reasons why Tyler Perry has cleaned up financially.  He has brought such amazing characters to the big screen that people are clamoring to see more of his romantic movies.  For interracial couples to be featured in books or movies, it doesn't have to be some lurid combination. It can be subtle and beautiful. People realize this, and are moving towards more accurate representation.
I'd like to see different kinds of relationships represented in more depth.
 Quirky, unique and different love stories need to be told. I'm tired of seeing only the 'usual suspects' time and again. I want to see strange couples and new stories.   

It's hard to watch/read about interracial relationships without feeling incredibly frustrated. Sometimes I think we'll never get to a place where interracial relationships are just about the relationship, not about the fact that the two people are of two different races.  It's been done very well a few times (one of my favorites is ""Empire""), but it doesn't happen enough for me. 
What irritates me is when people describe things and every time they describe the color of the person they go 'black/ brotherwhite, girl"" etc, instead of their personal story. It is such a tired, repetitive theme. I hate it. I can't even watch movies that give the black man a hot sister to meet as a hooker or some other profession like that, because it is just so lurid and tasteless.  just hate it.
