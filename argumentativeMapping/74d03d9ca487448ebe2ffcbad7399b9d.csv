 School should be a time for students to learn how to think like their teachers, rather than for students to think on their own. This attitude can help students in the future tremendously. By learning how to think like other people, students can solve problems in an effective way and live happy lives. Obedience to authority is extremely important, as well. By always following the rules, people can create a safe environment where everyone can function properly. The world would be worse off if all people made their own decisions. Because the majority of people cannot make rational decisions in their own interest. It is better for them to follow other peoples rules, because the rules created by others are probably in the common good.

 School should be a time for students to learn how to think like their teachers, rather than for students to think on their own. This attitude can help students in the future tremendously. By learning how to think like other people, students can solve problems in an effective way and live happy lives. Obedience to authority is extremely important, as well. By always following the rules, people can create a safe environment where everyone can function properly. The world would be worse off if all people made their own decisions.
