I think that it is a good thing to focus on animal welfare because it can help us understand the way we treat animals and how we can change that.  Many animals species are on the verge of extinction. If we focus on animal welfare, we can help save many species of animals.

There's plenty of humans on the planet. By the year 2050, the world population is estimated to be 9.6 billion. In contrast, many species of animals are becoming extinct every day. National Geographic estimates that between 1970 and 2012, the number of wild animals on Earth has fallen by half.  Soon, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I think that it is a good thing to focus on animal welfare because it can help us understand the way we treat animals and how we can change that.  Many animals species are on the verge of extinction. If we focus on animal welfare, we can help save many species of animals.

There's plenty of humans on the planet. By the year 2050, the world population is estimated to be 9.6 billion. In contrast, many species of animals are becoming extinct every day. National Geographic estimates that between 1970 and 2012, the number of wild animals on Earth has fallen by half.  Soon, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.
