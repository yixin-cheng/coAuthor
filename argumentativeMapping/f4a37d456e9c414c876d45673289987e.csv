What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, I would watch shows and movies with stereo typical characters because I feel that they are interesting and entertaining but I don't always agree with them. Sometimes it really adds flavor to the show, as well as high entertainment value. Now before you start calling me a bigot, or some kind of racist, let me explain. 
One of my favorite shows is ""FThe Big Bang Theory.
 If you look at that show, everyone of the characters in it portrays some form of a stereotype.  Sheldon Cooper is a stereotypical smart guy nerd who acts like a robot, the next one: Howard Wolowitz is a stereotypical Jewish American, as well as Rajesh Koothrappali, and Leonard Hofstadter all portray ""nerds"". They are all scientists, and that is a huge stereotype. Then you have Penny, who the stereo typical blonde girl next door that comes off as dumb and clueless.

As you can see that show is full of ""cringe"" worthy stereotypes, but that adds more to the flavor and humor of the show. That's what makes it worth watching. So I can not say I would not ever watch a show full of stereo typical type characters, because sometimes people take it to personally when it's not meant to be. It's just a show.
