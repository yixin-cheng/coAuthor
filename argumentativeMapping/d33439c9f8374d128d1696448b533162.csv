In my opinion, there are a few things students should learn in school that are primary. The first is the ability to communicate. All things involving literary knowledge contribute to communication. Reading and writing are greatly involved in communication. It is through reading and writing that students learn language fluently enough to understand and be understood by others. Surely this is one of the most important things.
The second is the ability to think critically.
 Even though this sounds basic, this skill teaches a person how to learn. In school students are often asked questions that teach them how to look up answers and basically how to infer knowledge about how to ask and answer questions about our world. 
The third is the ability to work with others.
 Often in school, some classes will periodically place students in groups or pairs in order to work together. This helps them learn how to get along with other people in the real world. In many, if not most jobs, the skills used when working together become important to put to use. This can include anything from listening, to collaborating ideas, and even to dealing with the frustrations that can arise when working with others. Putting these skills into practice at an early age is very important for social development.

In my opinion, there are a few things students should learn in school that are primary. The first is the ability to communicate. All things involving literary knowledge contribute to communication. Reading and writing are greatly involved in communication. It is through reading and writing that students learn language fluently enough to understand and be understood by others. Surely this is one of the most important things.
The second is the ability to think critically.
 Even though this sounds basic, this skill teaches a person how to learn. In school students are often asked questions that teach them how to look up answers and basically how to infer knowledge about how to ask and answer questions about our world. 
The third is the ability to work with others.
 Often in school, some classes will periodically place students in groups or pairs in order to work together. This helps them learn how to get along with other people in the real world. In many, if not most jobs, the skills used when working together become important to put to use. This can include anything from listening, to collaborating ideas, and even to dealing with the frustrations that can arise when working with others. Putting these skills into practice at an early age is very important for social development.

In my opinion, there are a few things students should learn in school that are primary. The first is the ability to communicate. All things involving literary knowledge contribute to communication. Reading and writing are greatly involved in communication. It is through reading and writing that students learn language fluently enough to understand and be understood by others. Surely this is one of the most important things.
The second is the ability to think critically.
 Even though this sounds basic, this skill teaches a person how to learn. In school students are often asked questions that teach them how to look up answers and basically how to infer knowledge about how to ask and answer questions about our world. 
The third is the ability to work with others.
 Often in school, some classes will periodically place students in groups or pairs in order to work together. This helps them learn how to get along with other people in the real world. In many, if not most jobs, the skills used when working together become important to put to use. This can include anything from listening, to collaborating ideas, and even to dealing with the frustrations that can arise when working with others. Putting these skills into practice at an early age is very important for social development.

In my opinion, there are a few things students should learn in school that are primary. The first is the ability to communicate. All things involving literary knowledge contribute to communication. Reading and writing are greatly involved in communication. It is through reading and writing that students learn language fluently enough to understand and be understood by others. Surely this is one of the most important things.
The second is the ability to think critically.
 Even though this sounds basic, this skill teaches a person how to learn. In school students are often asked questions that teach them how to look up answers and basically how to infer knowledge about how to ask and answer questions about our world. 
The third is the ability to work with others.

In many, if not most jobs, the skills used when working together become important to put to use. This can include anything from listening, to collaborating ideas, and even to dealing with the frustrations that can arise when working with others. Putting these skills into practice at an early age is very important for social development.
