An antique, leather-bound book is a delight, the ultimate sensory pleasure. The smell of an old leather-bound book is a metaphor for the wisdom and beauty locked inside.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, nothing compares with a real book. I have no argument with audiobooks, but when it comes to pure enjoyment and pleasure, nothing beats a real book in my hands, feeling the paper, the weight, turning the pages, smelling and feeling the book jacket, seeing my neat handwriting on the inside page of the front cover. 

I love to get an interesting or unusual book from a library or an antiquarian store or a friend, and then get to know the book and its quirks and treasures. An antique, leather-bound book is a delight, the ultimate sensory pleasure. The smell of an old leather-bound book is a metaphor for the wisdom and beauty locked inside.

n audiobook is not quite the same experience.
  Screens and electronics are everywhere, and the last thing I want to do after a day of working on the computer is go to bed with a gadget. 
S favor real books that I can hold in my hands, and turn the pages lovingly.
 The book itself is part of the experience, and I feel cheated when I listen to an audio-book. I feel almost as if someone might ""steal the soul"" out of the book for me, if I had to listen to it as an audiobook. 

You miss out on a lot when you listen rather than go through the book yourself. Some of it is simply the physical experience. You don't enjoy the book in the same way, and you don't form the same attachments. You don't write in it, you don't look at the photos or illustrations in it. And I wonder how much of the story is lost because it is read to you, rather than read by yourself.

You miss out on a lot when you listen rather than go through the book yourself. Some of it is simply the physical experience. You don't enjoy the book in the same way, and you don't form the same attachments. You don't write in it, you don't look at the photos or illustrations in it. And I wonder how much of the story is lost because it is read to you, rather than read by yourself.

In my opinion, nothing compares with a real book. I have no argument with audiobooks, but when it comes to pure enjoyment and pleasure, nothing beats a real book in my hands, feeling the paper, the weight, turning the pages, smelling and feeling the book jacket, seeing my neat handwriting on the inside page of the front cover. 

I love to get an interesting or unusual book from a library or an antiquarian store or a friend, and then get to know the book and its quirks and treasures. An antique, leather-bound book is a delight, the ultimate sensory pleasure. The smell of an old leather-bound book is a metaphor for the wisdom and beauty locked inside.

I have no argument with audiobooks, but when it comes to pure enjoyment and pleasure, nothing beats a real book in my hands, feeling the paper, the weight, turning the pages, smelling and feeling the book jacket, seeing my neat handwriting on the inside page of the front cover.
