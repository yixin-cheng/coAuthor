In my opinion, nothing compares with a real book. I have no argument with audiobooks, but when it comes to pure enjoyment and pleasure, nothing beats a real book in my hands, feeling the paper, the weight, turning the pages, smelling and feeling the book jacket, seeing my neat handwriting on the inside page of the front cover. 

I love to get an interesting or unusual book from a library or an antiquarian store or a friend, and then get to know the book and its quirks and treasures. An antique, leather-bound book is a delight, the ultimate sensory pleasure. The smell of an old leather-bound book is a metaphor for the wisdom and beauty locked inside.

In my opinion, nothing compares with a real book. I have no argument with audiobooks, but when it comes to pure enjoyment and pleasure, nothing beats a real book in my hands, feeling the paper, the weight, turning the pages, smelling and feeling the book jacket, seeing my neat handwriting on the inside page of the front cover. 

I love to get an interesting or unusual book from a library or an antiquarian store or a friend, and then get to know the book and its quirks and treasures. An antique, leather-bound book is a delight, the ultimate sensory pleasure. The smell of an old leather-bound book is a metaphor for the wisdom and beauty locked inside.

In my opinion, nothing compares with a real book. I have no argument with audiobooks, but when it comes to pure enjoyment and pleasure, nothing beats a real book in my hands, feeling the paper, the weight, turning the pages, smelling and feeling the book jacket, seeing my neat handwriting on the inside page of the front cover. 

I love to get an interesting or unusual book from a library or an antiquarian store or a friend, and then get to know the book and its quirks and treasures. An antique, leather-bound book is a delight, the ultimate sensory pleasure. The smell of an old leather-bound book is a metaphor for the wisdom and beauty locked inside.

In my opinion, nothing compares with a real book. I have no argument with audiobooks, but when it comes to pure enjoyment and pleasure, nothing beats a real book in my hands, feeling the paper, the weight, turning the pages, smelling and feeling the book jacket, seeing my neat handwriting on the inside page of the front cover.

An antique, leather-bound book is a delight, the ultimate sensory pleasure. The smell of an old leather-bound book is a metaphor for the wisdom and beauty locked inside.

 The book itself is part of the experience, and I feel cheated when I listen to an audio-book. I feel almost as if someone might ""steal the soul"" out of the book for me, if I had to listen to it as an audiobook.

In my opinion, nothing compares with a real book. I have no argument with audiobooks, but when it comes to pure enjoyment and pleasure, nothing beats a real book in my hands, feeling the paper, the weight, turning the pages, smelling and feeling the book jacket, seeing my neat handwriting on the inside page of the front cover.

An antique, leather-bound book is a delight, the ultimate sensory pleasure. The smell of an old leather-bound book is a metaphor for the wisdom and beauty locked inside.

I have no argument with audiobooks, but when it comes to pure enjoyment and pleasure, nothing beats a real book in my hands, feeling the paper, the weight, turning the pages, smelling and feeling the book jacket, seeing my neat handwriting on the inside page of the front cover.

In my opinion, nothing compares with a real book. I have no argument with audiobooks, but when it comes to pure enjoyment and pleasure, nothing beats a real book in my hands, feeling the paper, the weight, turning the pages, smelling and feeling the book jacket, seeing my neat handwriting on the inside page of the front cover.

In my opinion, nothing compares with a real book. I have no argument with audiobooks, but when it comes to pure enjoyment and pleasure, nothing beats a real book in my hands; feeling the paper, the weight, turning the pages, smelling and feeling the book jacket, seeing my neat handwriting on the inside page of the front cover. 

I love to get an interesting or unusual book from a library, antique store or a friend, and then get to know the book and its quirks and treasures. An historic, leather-bound book is a delight, the ultimate sensory pleasure. The smell of an old leather-bound book is a metaphor for the wisdom and beauty locked inside.

You don't enjoy the book in the same way, and you don't form the same attachments. You don't write in it, you don't look at the photos or illustrations in it. And I wonder how much of the story is lost because it is read to you, rather than read by yourself.

Reading a book is like meeting another person face-to-face.  Audiobooks are like meeting them via social media or a dating app. They are very different things!

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?
