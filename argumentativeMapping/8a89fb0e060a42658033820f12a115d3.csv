In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18.

Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary?

And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering.

Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mea",user,21,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18.

 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school.

And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering.

And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid?

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid?

 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible.

 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid?

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University!

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble.

But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble.

I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible.

That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble.

I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18.

I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble. 

I just don't see how you could argue that college athletes should be paid, not when a shocking amount of them struggle to do well in school. They should be in school as students, not as professional athletes. Ye",user,29,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary?

In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18.

I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble.

But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble. 

I just don't see how you could argue that college athletes should be paid, not when a shocking amount of them struggle to do well in school. They should be in school as students, not as professional athletes. Yes, their athletic activities might generate revenue on the school, but it is their education that will secure their future.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble. 

I just don't see how you could argue that college athletes should be paid, not when a shocking amount of them struggle to do well in school. They should be in school as students, not as professional athletes. Yes, their athletic activities might generate revenue on the school, but it is their education that will secure their future.

I just don't see how you could argue that college athletes should be paid, not when a shocking amount of them struggle to do well in school.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid?

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble. 

I just don't see how you could argue that college athletes should be paid, not when a shocking amount of them struggle to do well in school. They should be in school as students, not as professional athletes. Yes, their athletic activities might generate revenue on the school, but it is their education that will secure their future. So it's frustrating to me that some of these college athletes would even try to get paid, when they're already making more than most people, and when they're given the opportunity to get their college education for free.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble. 

I just don't see how you could argue that college athletes should be paid, not when a shocking amount of them struggle to do well in school. They should be in school as students, not as professional athletes. Yes, their athletic activities might generate revenue on the school, but it is their education that will secure their future. So it's frustrating to me that some of these college athletes would even try to get paid, when they're already making more than most people, and when they're given the opportunity to get their college education for free.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble. 

I just don't see how you could argue that college athletes should be paid, not when a shocking amount of them struggle to do well in school. They should be in school as students, not as professional athletes. Yes, their athletic activities might generate revenue on the school, but it is their education that will secure their future. So it's frustrating to me that some of these college athletes would even try to get paid, when they're already making more than most people, and when they're given the opportunity to get their college education for free.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble. 

I just don't see how you could argue that college athletes should be paid, not when a shocking amount of them struggle to do well in school. They should be in school as students, not as professional athletes. Yes, their athletic activities might generate revenue on the school, but it is their education that will secure their future. So it's frustrating to me that some of these college athletes would even try to get paid, when they're already making more than most people, and when they're given the opportunity to get their college education for free.

 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble. 

I just don't see how you could argue that college athletes should be paid, not when a shocking amount of them struggle to do well in school. They should be in school as students, not as professional athletes. Yes, their athletic activities might generate revenue on the school, but it is their education that will secure their future. So it's frustrating to me that some of these college athletes would even try to get paid, when they're already making more than most people, and when they're given the opportunity to get their college education for free. Plus, a lot of schools give their athletes a stipend, but a lot of these college athletes spend it on designer clothes and other forms of wastefulness.I",user,31,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble. 

I just don't see how you could argue that college athletes should be paid, not when a shocking amount of them struggle to do well in school. They should be in school as students, not as professional athletes. Yes, their athletic activities might generate revenue on the school, but it is their education that will secure their future. So it's frustrating to me that some of these college athletes would even try to get paid, when they're already making more than most people, and when they're given the opportunity to get their college education for free. Plus, a lot of schools give their athletes a stipend, but a lot of these college athletes spend it on designer clothes and other forms of wastefulness. I even he",user,32,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble.

That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player.

I just don't see how you could argue that college athletes should be paid, not when a shocking amount of them struggle to do well in school. They should be in school as students, not as professional athletes. Yes, their athletic activities might generate revenue on the school, but it is their education that will secure their future. So it's frustrating to me that some of these college athletes would even try to get paid, when they're already making more than most people, and when they're given the opportunity to get their college education for free.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary?

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble. 

I just don't see how you could argue that college athletes should be paid, not when a shocking amount of them struggle to do well in school. They should be in school as students, not as professional athletes. Yes, their athletic activities might generate revenue on the school, but it is their education that will secure their future. So it's frustrating to me that some of these college athletes would even try to get paid, when they're already making more than most people, and when they're given the opportunity to get their college education for free. Plus, a lot of schools give their athletes a stipend, but a lot of these college athletes spend it on designer clothes and other forms of wastefulness. I even heard that Soeurette spent a large chunk of her academic stipend on a designer purse from Kate Spade. That's ju",user,33,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble. 

I just don't see how you could argue that college athletes should be paid, not when a shocking amount of them struggle to do well in school. They should be in school as students, not as professional athletes. Yes, their athletic activities might generate revenue on the school, but it is their education that will secure their future. So it's frustrating to me that some of these college athletes would even try to get paid, when they're already making more than most people, and when they're given the opportunity to get their college education for free. Plus, a lot of schools give their athletes a stipend, but a lot of these college athletes spend it on designer clothes and other forms of wastefulness. I even heard that Soeurette spent a large chunk of her academic stipend on a designer purse from Kate Spade. That's just the kind of ghetto spending that I am appalled at, because she could have just gone to TJ Maxx and purchased an equivalent purse for about 15 times less money.

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble. 

I just don't see how you could argue that college athletes should be paid, not when a shocking amount of them struggle to do well in school. They should be in school as students, not as professional athletes. Yes, their athletic activities might generate revenue on the school, but it is their education that will secure their future. So it's frustrating to me that some of these college athletes would even try to get paid, when they're already making more than most people, and when they're given the opportunity to get their college education for free. Plus, a lot of schools give their athletes a stipend, but a lot of these college athletes spend it on designer clothes and other forms of wastefulness. I even heard that Soeurette spent a large chunk of her academic stipend on a designer purse from Kate Spade. That's just the kind of ghetto spending that I am appalled at, because she could have just gone to TJ Maxx and purchased an equivalent purse for about 15 times less money. But this is what some athletes do, and then I have to step in and ask myself who is crazy here? Certai",user,35,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble. 

I just don't see how you could argue that college athletes should be paid, not when a shocking amount of them struggle to do well in school. They should be in school as students, not as professional athletes. Yes, their athletic activities might generate revenue on the school, but it is their education that will secure their future. So it's frustrating to me that some of these college athletes would even try to get paid, when they're already making more than most people, and when they're given the opportunity to get their college education for free. Plus, a lot of schools give their athletes a stipend, but a lot of these college athletes spend it on designer clothes and other forms of wastefulness. I even heard that Soeurette spent a large chunk of her academic stipend on a designer purse from Kate Spade. That's just the kind of ghetto spending that I am appalled at, because she could have just gone to TJ Maxx and purchased an equivalent purse for about 15 times less money. But this is what some athletes do, and then I have to step in and ask myself who is crazy here? Certainly it's n",user,35,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble. 

I just don't see how you could argue that college athletes should be paid, not when a shocking amount of them struggle to do well in school. They should be in school as students, not as professional athletes. Yes, their athletic activities might generate revenue on the school, but it is their education that will secure their future. So it's frustrating to me that some of these college athletes would even try to get paid, when they're already making more than most people, and when they're given the opportunity to get their college education for free. Plus, a lot of schools give their athletes a stipend, but a lot of these college athletes spend it on designer clothes and other forms of wastefulness. I even heard that Soeurette spent a large chunk of her academic stipend on a designer purse from Kate Spade. That's just the kind of ghetto spending that I am appalled at, because she could have just gone to TJ Maxx and purchased an equivalent purse for about 15 times less money. But this is what some athletes do, and then I have to step in and ask myself who is crazy here? Certainly it's not me f",user,35,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble. 

I just don't see how you could argue that college athletes should be paid, not when a shocking amount of them struggle to do well in school. They should be in school as students, not as professional athletes. Yes, their athletic activities might generate revenue on the school, but it is their education that will secure their future. So it's frustrating to me that some of these college athletes would even try to get paid, when they're already making more than most people, and when they're given the opportunity to get their college education for free. Plus, a lot of schools give their athletes a stipend, but a lot of these college athletes spend it on designer clothes and other forms of wastefulness. I even heard that Soeurette spent a large chunk of her academic stipend on a designer purse from Kate Spade. That's just the kind of ghetto spending that I am appalled at, because she could have just gone to TJ Maxx and purchased an equivalent purse for about 15 times less money. But this is what some athletes do, and then I have to step in and ask myself who is crazy here? Certainly it's not me for believ",user,35,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble. 

I just don't see how you could argue that college athletes should be paid, not when a shocking amount of them struggle to do well in school. They should be in school as students, not as professional athletes. Yes, their athletic activities might generate revenue on the school, but it is their education that will secure their future. So it's frustrating to me that some of these college athletes would even try to get paid, when they're already making more than most people, and when they're given the opportunity to get their college education for free. Plus, a lot of schools give their athletes a stipend, but a lot of these college athletes spend it on designer clothes and other forms of wastefulness. I even heard that Soeurette spent a large chunk of her academic stipend on a designer purse from Kate Spade. That's just the kind of ghetto spending that I am appalled at, because she could have just gone to TJ Maxx and purchased an equivalent purse for about 15 times less money. But this is what some athletes do, and then I have to step in and ask myself who is crazy here? Certainly it's not me for believing that ",user,35,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
