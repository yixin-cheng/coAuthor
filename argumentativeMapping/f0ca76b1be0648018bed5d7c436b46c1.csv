In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. In fact, it is important to do so. Animals are more vulnerable to suffering than humans. Humans have many people speaking for them, while animals do not. 
I think that people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals because they are not as complex as humans.

It is easier to empathize with something that we own than it is to empathize with a stranger.
