Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines...

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines...

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it.

I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me.

And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it.

I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it.

And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books.

I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention.

I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do.

I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters.

Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books.

I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books.

I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way?

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way?

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners?

So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners?

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself.

I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners?

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do.

I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way?

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners?

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? 

In conclusion, I am happy to stick to reading real books. I think",user,28,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners?

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own.

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way?

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters.

Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way?

In conclusion, I am happy to stick to reading real books. I think that there's a lot to be said for the real, tangible relationship between a reader and their pages.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? I have never fe

In conclusion, I am happy to stick to reading real books. I think that there's a lot to be said for the real, tangible relationship between a reader and their pages. Plus, there's definitely a lot to be said for the tactile experience that a real book allows - that's a whole other argument for another day.",user,27,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me.

On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own.

So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way?

In conclusion, I am happy to stick to reading real books. I think that there's a lot to be said for the real, tangible relationship between a reader and their pages.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? I have never felt that I couldn't make up my

In conclusion, I am happy to stick to reading real books. I think that there's a lot to be said for the real, tangible relationship between a reader and their pages.

I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? I have never felt that I couldn't make up my own nt

In conclusion, I am happy to stick to reading real books. I think that there's a lot to be said for the real, tangible relationship between a reader and their pages. Plus, there's definitely a lot to be said for the tactile experience that a real book allows - that's a whole other argument for another day.",user,27,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own.

I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? I have never felt that I couldn't make up my own interp

In conclusion, I am happy to stick to reading real books. I think that there's a lot to be said for the real, tangible relationship between a reader and their pages. Plus, there's definitely a lot to be said for the tactile experience that a real book allows - that's a whole other argument for another day.",user,27,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? I have never felt that I couldn't make up my own interpretation 

In conclusion, I am happy to stick to reading real books. I think that there's a lot to be said for the real, tangible relationship between a reader and their pages. Plus, there's definitely a lot to be said for the tactile experience that a real book allows - that's a whole other argument for another day.",user,27,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me.

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way?

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? I have never felt that I couldn't make up my own interpretation of an author's ending in a book that

In conclusion, I am happy to stick to reading real books. I think that there's a lot to be said for the real, tangible relationship between a reader and their pages. Plus, there's definitely a lot to be said for the tactile experience that a real book allows - that's a whole other argument for another day.",user,27,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? I have never felt that I couldn't make up my own interpretation of an author's ending in a book that I had in

In conclusion, I am happy to stick to reading real books. I think that there's a lot to be said for the real, tangible relationship between a reader and their pages. Plus, there's definitely a lot to be said for the tactile experience that a real book allows - that's a whole other argument for another day.",user,27,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? I have never felt that I couldn't make up my own interpretation of an author's ending in a book that I had in my hands.

In conclusion, I am happy to stick to reading real books. I think that there's a lot to be said for the real, tangible relationship between a reader and their pages.

On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? I have never felt that I couldn't make up my own interpretation of an author's ending in a book that I had in my hands. So my

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words.

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? I have never felt that I couldn't make up my own interpretation of an author's ending in a book that I had in my hands. So my friends' 

In conclusion, I am happy to stick to reading real books. I think that there's a lot to be said for the real, tangible relationship between a reader and their pages.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way?

I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? I have never felt that I couldn't make up my own interpretation of an author's ending in a book that I had in my hands. So my friends' perspective see

In conclusion, I am happy to stick to reading real books. I think that there's a lot to be said for the real, tangible relationship between a reader and their pages. Plus, there's definitely a lot to be said for the tactile experience that a real book allows - that's a whole other argument for another day.",user,28,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines...

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners?

I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? I have never felt that I couldn't make up my own interpretation of an author's ending in a book that I had in my hands. So my friends' perspective seems very skewed to me. It could just b

In conclusion, I am happy to stick to reading real books. I think that there's a lot to be said for the real, tangible relationship between a reader and their pages. Plus, there's definitely a lot to be said for the tactile experience that a real book allows - that's a whole other argument for another day.",user,29,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters.

Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners?

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters.

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? I have never felt that I couldn't make up my own interpretation of an author's ending in a book that I had in my hands. So my friends' perspective seems very skewed to me.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me.

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way?

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? I have never felt that I couldn't make up my own interpretation of an author's ending in a book that I had in my hands. So my friends' perspective seems very skewed to me.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? I have never felt that I couldn't make up my own interpretation of an author's ending in a book that I had in my hands. So my friends' perspective seems very skewed to me. It could just be their bias, though, because I know how much they enjoy reading

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? I have never felt that I couldn't make up my own interpretation of an author's ending in a book that I had in my hands. So my friends' perspective seems very skewed to me. It could just be their bias, though, because I know how much they enjoy reading audi

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? I have never felt that I couldn't make up my own interpretation of an author's ending in a book that I had in my hands. So my friends' perspective seems very skewed to me. It could just be their bias, though, because I know how much they enjoy rea

In conclusion, I am happy to stick to reading real books. I think that there's a lot to be said for the real, tangible relationship between a reader and their pages. Plus, there's definitely a lot to be said for the tactile experience that a real book allows - that's a whole other argument for another day.",user,29,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? I have never felt that I couldn't make up my own interpretation of an author's ending in a book that I had in my hands. So my friends' perspective seems very skewed to me. It could just be their bias, though, because I know how much they enjoy hearin

In conclusion, I am happy to stick to reading real books. I think that there's a lot to be said for the real, tangible relationship between a reader and their pages. Plus, there's definitely a lot to be said for the tactile experience that a real book allows - that's a whole other argument for another day.",user,29,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? I have never felt that I couldn't make up my own interpretation of an author's ending in a book that I had in my hands. So my friends' perspective seems very skewed to me. It could just be their bias, though, because I know how much they enjoy hearing audiobo

In conclusion, I am happy to stick to reading real books. I think that there's a lot to be said for the real, tangible relationship between a reader and their pages. Plus, there's definitely a lot to be said for the tactile experience that a real book allows - that's a whole other argument for another day.",user,29,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? I have never felt that I couldn't make up my own interpretation of an author's ending in a book that I had in my hands. So my friends' perspective seems very skewed to me. It could just be their bias, though, because I know how much they enjoy hearing audiobooks every

In conclusion, I am happy to stick to reading real books. I think that there's a lot to be said for the real, tangible relationship between a reader and their pages. Plus, there's definitely a lot to be said for the tactile experience that a real book allows - that's a whole other argument for another day.",user,29,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? I have never felt that I couldn't make up my own interpretation of an author's ending in a book that I had in my hands. So my friends' perspective seems very skewed to me. It could just be their bias, though, because I know how much they enjoy hearing audiobooks 

In conclusion, I am happy to stick to reading real books. I think that there's a lot to be said for the real, tangible relationship between a reader and their pages. Plus, there's definitely a lot to be said for the tactile experience that a real book allows - that's a whole other argument for another day.",user,29,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? I have never felt that I couldn't make up my own interpretation of an author's ending in a book that I had in my hands. So my friends' perspective seems very skewed to me.

In conclusion, I am happy to stick to reading real books. I think that there's a lot to be said for the real, tangible relationship between a reader and their pages.
