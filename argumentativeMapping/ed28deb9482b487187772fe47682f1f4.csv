In my opinion, yes, schools should provide free pads and tampons to female students. 
 believe that pads and tampons are a necessity, just like toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already
 provided free of charge to students when they have a need for them. It seems quite unfair to me that girls in school don't have this provided to them already. I think that if both sexes needed this type of thing then it would already be provided. 
I think that this is a very important issue. I myself have experienced humiliation related to this issue. I was only a 6th grader when I didn't have a pad with me and bled on myself. I was laughed at and had to be sent home. I was so sad and humiliated. If I had access to period products then I would have had what I needed to prevent the whole embarrassing situation.

 believe that pads and tampons are a necessity, just like toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already
 provided free of charge to students when they have a need for them. It seems quite unfair to me that girls in school don't have this provided to them already. I think that if both sexes needed this type of thing then it would already be provided. 
I think that this is a very important issue. I myself have experienced humiliation related to this issue. I was only a 6th grader when I didn't have a pad with me and bled on myself. I was laughed at and had to be sent home. I was so sad and humiliated. If I had access to period products then I would have had what I needed to prevent the whole embarrassing situation.

 believe that pads and tampons are a necessity, just like toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already
 provided free of charge to students when they have a need for them. It seems quite unfair to me that girls in school don't have this provided to them already. I think that if both sexes needed this type of thing then it would already be provided. 
I think that this is a very important issue. I myself have experienced humiliation related to this issue. I was only a 6th grader when I didn't have a pad with me and bled on myself. I was laughed at and had to be sent home. I was so sad and humiliated. If I had access to period products then I would have had what I needed to prevent the whole embarrassing situation. I hope that this type of situation will one day be taken seriously, if it hasn't already.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, yes, schools should provide free pads and tampons to female students. 
 believe that pads and tampons are a necessity, just like toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already
 provided free of charge to students when they have a need for them. It seems quite unfair to me that girls in school don't have this provided to them already. I think that if both sexes needed this type of thing then it would already be provided. 
I think that this is a very important issue. I myself have experienced humiliation related to this issue. I was only a 6th grader when I didn't have a pad with me and bled on myself. I was laughed at and had to be sent home. I was so sad and humiliated. If I had access to period products then I would have had what I needed to prevent the whole embarrassing situation. I hope that this type of situation will one day be taken seriously, if it hasn't already.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, yes, schools should provide free pads and tampons to female students. 
 believe that pads and tampons are a necessity, just like toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already
 provided free of charge to students when they have a need for them. It seems quite unfair to me that girls in school don't have this provided to them already. I think that if both sexes needed this type of thing then it would already be provided. 
I think that this is a very important issue. I myself have experienced humiliation related to this issue. I was only a 6th grader when I didn't have a pad with me and bled on myself. I was laughed at and had to be sent home. I was so sad and humiliated. If I had access to period products then I would have had what I needed to prevent the whole embarrassing situation. I hope that this type of situation will one day be taken seriously, if it hasn't already.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, yes, schools should provide free pads and tampons to female students. 
 believe that pads and tampons are a necessity, just like toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already
 provided free of charge to students when they have a need for them. It seems quite unfair to me that girls in school don't have this provided to them already. I think that if both sexes needed this type of thing then it would already be provided. 
I think that this is a very important issue. I myself have experienced humiliation related to this issue. I was only a 6th grader when I didn't have a pad with me and bled on myself. I was laughed at and had to be sent home. I was so sad and humiliated. If I had access to period products then I would have had what I needed to prevent the whole embarrassing situation. I hope that this type of situation will one day be taken seriously, if it hasn't already.

 believe that pads and tampons are a necessity, just like toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, yes, schools should provide free pads and tampons to female students. 
 believe that pads and tampons are a necessity, just like toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already
 provided free of charge to students when they have a need for them. It seems quite unfair to me that girls in school don't have this provided to them already. I think that if both sexes needed this type of thing then it would already be provided. 
I think that this is a very important issue. I myself have experienced humiliation related to this issue. I was only a 6th grader when I didn't have a pad with me and bled on myself. I was laughed at and had to be sent home. I was so sad and humiliated. If I had access to period products then I would have had what I needed to prevent the whole embarrassing situation.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, yes, schools should provide free pads and tampons to female students. 
 believe that pads and tampons are a necessity, just like toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already
 provided free of charge to students when they have a need for them. It seems quite unfair to me that girls in school don't have this provided to them already. I think that if both sexes needed this type of thing then it would already be provided. 
I think that this is a very important issue. I myself have experienced humiliation related to this issue. I was only a 6th grader when I didn't have a pad with me and bled on myself. I was laughed at and had to be sent home. I was so sad and humiliated. If I had access to period products then I would have had what I needed to prevent the whole embarrassing situation. I hope that this type of situation will one day be taken seriously, if it hasn't already.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, yes, schools should provide free pads and tampons to female students. 
 believe that pads and tampons are a necessity, just like toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already
 provided free of charge to students when they have a need for them. It seems quite unfair to me that girls in school don't have this provided to them already. I think that if both sexes needed this type of thing then it would already be provided. 
I think that this is a very important issue. I myself have experienced humiliation related to this issue. I was only a 6th grader when I didn't have a pad with me and bled on myself. I was laughed at and had to be sent home. I was so sad and humiliated. If I had access to period products then I would have had what I needed to prevent the whole embarrassing situation. I hope that this type of situation will one day be taken seriously, if it hasn't already.
I believe schools should step in and provide pads and tampons free of charge and that students should have free access to them without having to ask someone.

In my opinion, yes, schools should provide free pads and tampons to female students. 
 believe that pads and tampons are a necessity, just like toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already
 provided free of charge to students when they have a need for them. It seems quite unfair to me that girls in school don't have this provided to them already. I think that if both sexes needed this type of thing then it would already be provided. 
I think that this is a very important issue. I myself have experienced humiliation related to this issue. I was only a 6th grader when I didn't have a pad with me and bled on myself. I was laughed at and had to be sent home. I was so sad and humiliated. If I had access to period products then I would have had what I needed to prevent the whole embarrassing situation.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, yes, schools should provide free pads and tampons to female students. 
 believe that pads and tampons are a necessity, just like toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already
 provided free of charge to students when they have a need for them. It seems quite unfair to me that girls in school don't have this provided to them already. I think that if both sexes needed this type of thing then it would already be provided. 
I think that this is a very important issue. I myself have experienced humiliation related to this issue. I was only a 6th grader when I didn't have a pad with me and bled on myself. I was laughed at and had to be sent home. I was so sad and humiliated. If I had access to period products then I would have had what I needed to prevent the whole embarrassing situation. I hope that this type of situation will one day be taken seriously, if it hasn't already.
I believe schools should step in and provide pads and tampons free of charge and that students should have free access to them without having to ask someone.

text-insert,"Should Schools Provide Free Pads and Tampons?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, yes, schools should provide free pads and tampons to female students. 
 believe that pads and tampons are a necessity, just like toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already
 provided free of charge to students when they have a need for them. It seems quite unfair to me that girls in school don't have this provided to them already. I think that if both sexes needed this type of thing then it would already be provided. 
I think that this is a very important issue. I myself have experienced humiliation related to this issue. I was only a 6th grader when I didn't have a pad with me and bled on myself. I was laughed at and had to be sent home. I was so sad and humiliated. If I had access to period products then I would have had what I needed to prevent the whole embarrassing situation. I hope that this type of situation will one day be taken seriously, if it hasn't already.
