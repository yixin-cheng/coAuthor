Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, pads and tampons fall into a category of personal products that are both essential to students at times, but are generally only provided 'as needed.' That is, they aren't provided as a matter of course. Do schools supply students with enough toilet paper to use at home? No. Do they give students soap to take with them and wash their hands 7 days a week? Heck no! Are students given a supply of Band-Aids to take home and use whenever they cut themselves during the year? Of course not! 

All of these items are provided to students when they are needed on school facilities, but clearly students have access to them at home, too, not provided by the school, but by their parents. Tampons are a little different, in that, unlike soap, which students might use at home, and then need in the school bathroom, a tampon or pad is typically used while in a hygienic spot, the bathroom at home, and then worn until it is removed, and only replaced in public when it's absolutely needed.

In my opinion, pads and tampons fall into a category of personal products that are both essential to students at times, but are generally only provided 'as needed.' That is, they aren't provided as a matter of course. Do schools supply students with enough toilet paper to use at home? No. Do they give students soap to take with them and wash their hands 7 days a week? Heck no! Are students given a supply of Band-Aids to take home and use whenever they cut themselves during the year? Of course not! 

All of these items are provided to students when they are needed on school facilities, but clearly students have access to them at home, too, not provided by the school, but by their parents. Tampons are a little different, in that, unlike soap, which students might use at home, and then need in the school bathroom, a tampon or pad is typically used while in a hygienic spot, the bathroom at home, and then worn until it is removed, and only replaced in public when it's absolutely needed.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, pads and tampons fall into a category of personal products that are both essential to students at times, but are generally only provided 'as needed.' That is, they aren't provided as a matter of course. Do schools supply students with enough toilet paper to use at home? No. Do they give students soap to take with them and wash their hands 7 days a week? Heck no! Are students given a supply of Band-Aids to take home and use whenever they cut themselves during the year? Of course not! 

All of these items are provided to students when they are needed on school facilities, but clearly students have access to them at home, too, not provided by the school, but by their parents. Tampons are a little different, in that, unlike soap, which students might use at home, and then need in the school bathroom, a tampon or pad is typically used while in a hygienic spot, the bathroom at home, and then worn until it is removed, and only replaced in public when it's absolutely needed. However they are replaced, in public, semi-routinely and women are likely to carry a supply with them in a variety of situations. 

Menstruating female students are unlikely to come to school without a tampon and then suddenly need a pad or tampon during the day; they are likely to be carrying those supplies with them. If for some reason th",user,19,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

That is, they aren't provided as a matter of course. Do schools supply students with enough toilet paper to use at home? No. Do they give students soap to take with them and wash their hands 7 days a week? Heck no!

Tampons are a little different, in that, unlike soap, which students might use at home, and then need in the school bathroom, a tampon or pad is typically used while in a hygienic spot, the bathroom at home, and then worn until it is removed, and only replaced in public when it's absolutely needed.

In my opinion, pads and tampons fall into a category of personal products that are both essential to students at times, but are generally only provided 'as needed.' That is, they aren't provided as a matter of course. Do schools supply students with enough toilet paper to use at home? No. Do they give students soap to take with them and wash their hands 7 days a week? Heck no! Are students given a supply of Band-Aids to take home and use whenever they cut themselves during the year? Of course not! 

All of these items are provided to students when they are needed on school facilities, but clearly students have access to them at home, too, not provided by the school, but by their parents. Tampons are a little different, in that, unlike soap, which students might use at home, and then need in the school bathroom, a tampon or pad is typically used while in a hygienic spot, the bathroom at home, and then worn until it is removed, and only replaced in public when it's absolutely needed. However they are replaced, in public, semi-routinely and women are likely to carry a supply with them in a variety of situations. 

Menstruating female students are unlikely to come to school without a tampon and then suddenly need a pad or tampon during the day; they are likely to be carrying those supplies with them. If for some reason they are not, a student should be able to simply ask to go to the bathroom, or schooperson can provide a tampon or pad if needed, whether it is provided by the school or brought",user,19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

That is, they aren't provided as a matter of course. Do schools supply students with enough toilet paper to use at home? No. Do they give students soap to take with them and wash their hands 7 days a week? Heck no! Are students given a supply of Band-Aids to take home and use whenever they cut themselves during the year? Of course not! 

All of these items are provided to students when they are needed on school facilities, but clearly students have access to them at home, too, not provided by the school, but by their parents. Tampons are a little different, in that, unlike soap, which students might use at home, and then need in the school bathroom, a tampon or pad is typically used while in a hygienic spot, the bathroom at home, and then worn until it is removed, and only replaced in public when it's absolutely needed. However they are replaced, in public, semi-routinely and women are likely to carry a supply with them in a variety of situations. 

Menstruating female students are unlikely to come to school without a tampon and then suddenly need a pad or tampon during the day; they are likely to be carrying those supplies with them.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, pads and tampons fall into a category of personal products that are both essential to students at times, but are generally only provided 'as needed.' That is, they aren't provided as a matter of course. Do schools supply students with enough toilet paper to use at home? No. Do they give students soap to take with them and wash their hands 7 days a week? Heck no! Are students given a supply of Band-Aids to take home and use whenever they cut themselves during the year? Of course not! 

All of these items are provided to students when they are needed on school facilities, but clearly students have access to them at home, too, not provided by the school, but by their parents. Tampons are a little different, in that, unlike soap, which students might use at home, and then need in the school bathroom, a tampon or pad is typically used while in a hygienic spot, the bathroom at home, and then worn until it is removed, and only replaced in public when it's absolutely needed. However they are replaced, in public, semi-routinely and women are likely to carry a supply with them in a variety of situations.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, pads and tampons fall into a category of personal products that are both essential to students at times, but are generally only provided 'as needed.' That is, they aren't provided as a matter of course. Do schools supply students with enough toilet paper to use at home? No. Do they give students soap to take with them and wash their hands 7 days a week? Heck no! Are students given a supply of Band-Aids to take home and use whenever they cut themselves during the year? Of course not! 

All of these items are provided to students when they are needed on school facilities, but clearly students have access to them at home, too, not provided by the school, but by their parents. Tampons are a little different, in that, unlike soap, which students might use at home, and then need in the school bathroom, a tampon or pad is typically used while in a hygienic spot, the bathroom at home, and then worn until it is removed, and only replaced in public when it's absolutely needed. However they are replaced, in public, semi-routinely and women are likely to carry a supply with them in a variety of situations. 

Menstruating female students are unlikely to come to school without a tampon and then suddenly need a pad or tampon during the day; they are likely to be carrying those supplies with them. If for some reason they are not, a student should be able to simply ask to go to the bathroom, or school clinic, and a staff person should be able to provide her with a pad or tampon.

No. Do they give students soap to take with them and wash their hands 7 days a week? Heck no! Are students given a supply of Band-Aids to take home and use whenever they cut themselves during the year? Of course not! 

All of these items are provided to students when they are needed on school facilities, but clearly students have access to them at home, too, not provided by the school, but by their parents. Tampons are a little different, in that, unlike soap, which students might use at home, and then need in the school bathroom, a tampon or pad is typically used while in a hygienic spot, the bathroom at home, and then worn until it is removed, and only replaced in public when it's absolutely needed. However they are replaced, in public, semi-routinely and women are likely to carry a supply with them in a variety of situations. 

Menstruating female students are unlikely to come to school without a tampon and then suddenly need a pad or tampon during the day; they are likely to be carrying those supplies with them. If for some reason they are not, a student should be able to simply ask to go to the bathroom, or school clinic, and a staff person should be able to provide her with a pad or tampon.

That is, they aren't provided as a matter of course. Do schools supply students with enough toilet paper to use at home? No. Do they give students soap to take with them and wash their hands 7 days a week? Heck no! Are students given a supply of Band-Aids to take home and use whenever they cut themselves during the year? Of course not! 

All of these items are provided to students when they are needed on school facilities, but clearly students have access to them at home, too, not provided by the school, but by their parents. Tampons are a little different, in that, unlike soap, which students might use at home, and then need in the school bathroom, a tampon or pad is typically used while in a hygienic spot, the bathroom at home, and then worn until it is removed, and only replaced in public when it's absolutely needed. However they are replaced, in public, semi-routinely and women are likely to carry a supply with them in a variety of situations. 

Menstruating female students are unlikely to come to school without a tampon and then suddenly need a pad or tampon during the day; they are likely to be carrying those supplies with them. If for some reason they are not, a student should be able to simply ask to go to the bathroom, or school clinic, and a staff person should be able to provide her with a pad or tampon.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, pads and tampons fall into a category of personal products that are both essential to students at times, but are generally only provided 'as needed.' That is, they aren't provided as a matter of course. Do schools supply students with enough toilet paper to use at home? No. Do they give students soap to take with them and wash their hands 7 days a week? Heck no! Are students given a supply of Band-Aids to take home and use whenever they cut themselves during the year? Of course not! 

All of these items are provided to students when they are needed on school facilities, but clearly students have access to them at home, too, not provided by the school, but by their parents. Tampons are a little different, in that, unlike soap, which students might use at home, and then need in the school bathroom, a tampon or pad is typically used while in a hygienic spot, the bathroom at home, and then worn until it is removed, and only replaced in public when it's absolutely needed. However they are replaced, in public, semi-routinely and women are likely to carry a supply with them in a variety of situations. 

Menstruating female students are unlikely to come to school without a tampon and then suddenly need a pad or tampon during the day; they are likely to be carrying those supplies with them. If for some reason they are not, a student should be able to simply ask to go to the bathroom, or school clinic, and a staff person should be able to provide her with a pad or tampon.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, pads and tampons fall into a category of personal products that are both essential to students at times, but are generally only provided 'as needed.' That is, they aren't provided as a matter of course. Do schools supply students with enough toilet paper to use at home? No. Do they give students soap to take with them and wash their hands 7 days a week? Heck no! Are students given a supply of Band-Aids to take home and use whenever they cut themselves during the year? Of course not! 

All of these items are provided to students when they are needed on school facilities, but clearly students have access to them at home, too, not provided by the school, but by their parents. Tampons are a little different, in that, unlike soap, which students might use at home, and then need in the school bathroom, a tampon or pad is typically used while in a hygienic spot, the bathroom at home, and then worn until it is removed, and only replaced in public when it's absolutely needed. However they are replaced, in public, semi-routinely and women are likely to carry a supply with them in a variety of situations. 

Menstruating female students are unlikely to come to school without a tampon and then suddenly need a pad or tampon during the day; they are likely to be carrying those supplies with them. If for some reason they are not, a student should be able to simply ask to go to the bathroom, or school clinic, and a staff person should be able to provide her with a pad or tampon.

So, asking schools to provide students who might occasionally need a pad or tampon, is reasonable. Asking them to constantly supply them with such ite",user,21,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, pads and tampons fall into a category of personal products that are both essential to students at times, but are generally only provided 'as needed.'

No. Do they give students soap to take with them and wash their hands 7 days a week? Heck no! Are students given a supply of Band-Aids to take home and use whenever they cut themselves during the year? Of course not! 

All of these items are provided to students when they are needed on school facilities, but clearly students have access to them at home, too, not provided by the school, but by their parents. Tampons are a little different, in that, unlike soap, which students might use at home, and then need in the school bathroom, a tampon or pad is typically used while in a hygienic spot, the bathroom at home, and then worn until it is removed, and only replaced in public when it's absolutely needed. However they are replaced, in public, semi-routinely and women are likely to carry a supply with them in a variety of situations.

That is, they aren't provided as a matter of course. Do schools supply students with enough toilet paper to use at home? No. Do they give students soap to take with them and wash their hands 7 days a week? Heck no! Are students given a supply of Band-Aids to take home and use whenever they cut themselves during the year? Of course not! 

All of these items are provided to students when they are needed on school facilities, but clearly students have access to them at home, too, not provided by the school, but by their parents. Tampons are a little different, in that, unlike soap, which students might use at home, and then need in the school bathroom, a tampon or pad is typically used while in a hygienic spot, the bathroom at home, and then worn until it is removed, and only replaced in public when it's absolutely needed. However they are replaced, in public, semi-routinely and women are likely to carry a supply with them in a variety of situations. 

Menstruating female students are unlikely to come to school without a tampon and then suddenly need a pad or tampon during the day; they are likely to be carrying those supplies with them. If for some reason they are not, a student should be able to simply ask to go to the bathroom, or school clinic, and a staff person should be able to provide her with a pad or tampon.

So, asking schools to provide students who might occasionally need a pad or tampon, is reasonable. Asking them to constantly supply them with such items, is unreasonable, and would be akin to asking the school to continually provide students with toilet paper, soap and Band-Aids, to use whenever they needed them",user,21,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
