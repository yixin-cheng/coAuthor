Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Billions of people believe in reincarnation, so let's assume that their right. That means that animals are likely to be either beings that will come back as humans, or else humans whom the karmic wheel has demoted.
So, if you are a meat eater, you are likely to be eating your own relatives.
 Not only that. but that meal may make the relative bear you quite a grudge. One can only wonder how many of a person's enemies were animals that the person hurt or mistreated in either the current or a previous life.

So it's really in your own best interest to treat animals well, because karma, as they say, is a bitch. 

Is there any proof of this, you may ask? Certainly! If you look into the face of any dog, you can see its resemblance to a person. My mother, in fact, had a German Shepherd named Francis who was a spitting image of my late Uncle Joe. Not only that, but Francis would lie in from the TV watching March Madness games in exactly the same spot my Uncle favored when he was alive.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Billions of people believe in reincarnation, so let's assume that their right. That means that animals are likely to be either beings that will come back as humans, or else humans whom the karmic wheel has demoted.
So, if you are a meat eater, you are likely to be eating your own relatives.
 Not only that. but that meal may make the relative bear you quite a grudge. One can only wonder how many of a person's enemies were animals that the person hurt or mistreated in either the current or a previous life.

Is there any proof of this, you may ask? Certainly! If you look into the face of any dog, you can see its resemblance to a person. My mother, in fact, had a German Shepherd named Francis who was a spitting image of my late Uncle Joe. Not only that, but Francis would lie in from the TV watching March Madness games in exactly the same spot my Uncle favored when he was alive.

Have you ever met a person to whom you had an instant connection. It may be that this is someone who you were nice to when they were an animal in a previous life. Or have youmet someone and experienced instant antipathy? Maybe when that person was an earthworm you split them open with a fishhook.",user,20,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Billions of people believe in reincarnation, so let's assume that their right. That means that animals are likely to be either beings that will come back as humans, or else humans whom the karmic wheel has demoted.
So, if you are a meat eater, you are likely to be eating your own relatives.
 Not only that. but that meal may make the relative bear you quite a grudge. One can only wonder how many of a person's enemies were animals that the person hurt or mistreated in either the current or a previous life.

So it's really in your own best interest to treat animals well, because karma, as they say, is a bitch. 

Is there any proof of this, you may ask? Certainly! If you look into the face of any dog, you can see its resemblance to a person. My mother, in fact, had a German Shepherd named Francis who was a spitting image of my late Uncle Joe. Not only that, but Francis would lie in from the TV watching March Madness games in exactly the same spot my Uncle favored when he was alive.

Have you ever met a person to whom you had an instant connection. It may be that this is someone who you were nice to when they were an animal in a previous life. Or have you ever met someone and experienced instant antipathy? Maybe when that person was an earthworm in a previous life and you split them open with a fishhook.
So, if you want to be a  treat animals well.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Billions of people believe in reincarnation, so let's assume that their right. That means that animals are likely to be either beings that will come back as humans, or else humans whom the karmic wheel has demoted.
So, if you are a meat eater, you are likely to be eating your own relatives.
 Not only that. but that meal may make the relative bear you quite a grudge. One can only wonder how many of a person's enemies were animals that the person hurt or mistreated in either the current or a previous life.

So it's really in your own best interest to treat animals well, because karma, as they say, is a bitch. 

Is there any proof of this, you may ask? Certainly! If you look into the face of any dog, you can see its resemblance to a person. My mother, in fact, had a German Shepherd named Francis who was a spitting image of my late Uncle Joe. Not only that, but Francis would lie in from the TV watching March Madness games in exactly the same spot my Uncle favored when he was alive.

Have you ever met a person to whom you had an instant connection. It may be that this is someone who you were nice to when they were an animal in a previous life. Or have you ever met someone and experienced instant antipathy? Maybe when that person was an earthworm in a previous life and you split them open with a fishhook.

My mother, in fact, had a German Shepherd named Francis who was a spitting image of my late Uncle Joe. Not only that, but Francis would lie in from the TV watching March Madness games in exactly the same spot my Uncle favored when he was alive.

Have you ever met a person to whom you had an instant connection. It may be that this is someone who you were nice to when they were an animal in a previous life. Or have you ever met someone and experienced instant antipathy? Maybe when that person was an earthworm in a previous life and you split them open with a fishhook.
So, if you want to be aget ahead in this universe treat animals well.
 They may be your relatives, or even your boss in a future life.
