In my opinion, college athletes should be paid over and above their scholarships. They should be paid a percentage of ticket sales. I do not agree that the broader community would be harmed.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid over and above their scholarships. They should be paid a percentage of ticket sales. I do not agree that the broader community would be harmed. This is real life. Times change. It is fair that if the college makes a great sum of income, thatsome of it go to the players. Colleges in bidding wars? They do that anyway, but without money. They bid for the best. The athletes would receive no compensation until they graduate, again, which would be a percentage of tickets sold. 

If colleges did not profit on their athletes, then no, they should not be paid. I think this is the best solution of all. This way, anyone can go to a game that they might not have otherwise been able to afford, creating good will in the community. Having good sports is a boon to the colleges. They get televised or broadcasted which increases brand awareness. There are some things that are hard to measure, like how much exposure they get and what it is worth.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?
