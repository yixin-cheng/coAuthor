The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families.

Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office.

This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. B",user,22,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office.

But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the s",user,24,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time.

This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that sh",user,26,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore.

So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office.

My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens.

I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows.

So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore.

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office.

There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with o",user,29,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a real",user,29,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chanc",user,29,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens.

This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level",user,29,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family wit",user,29,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens",user,29,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just c

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning..

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office.

I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time.

I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning...

I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning...

I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning...

I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning...

I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,14,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning...

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office.

I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That do

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary r

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning...

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning...

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office.

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, becaus

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning...

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea.

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story a

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning...

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself.

Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who wer

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens.

This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into th

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into their phones 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into their phones and social

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office.

I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into their phones and social media accounts that 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea.

This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into their phones and social media accounts that they pract

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning...

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into their phones and social media accounts that they practically lost all sense

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows?

This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into their phones and social media accounts that they practically lost all sense of their 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible.

But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into their phones and social media accounts that they practically lost all sense of self and ev

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into their phones and social media accounts that they practically lost all sense of self and eventuall 

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into their phones and social media accounts that they practically lost all sense of self and eventually event

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time.

So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens. ",user,15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into their phones and social media accounts that they practically lost all sense of self and eventually even lost a grip on real

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore.
