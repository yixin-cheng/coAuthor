In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people should want to keep up with what is going on. They don't need to know what is happening everywhere but it's good to at least know what is happening locally. I think it's important to know what is going on in your community and state. 

First it's important to know what may be going on for your and your families safety. You should know what is happening with the pandemic. You need to know if there are any upcoming severe weather threats. You should know what is happening with your local government and what they are doing to help the community. These are all things that can affect you directly. 

Second, you'll want to know what is going on so you don't miss out on anything fun. You don't want to miss out on a great concert or festival. There could be a new restaurant opening up that you would want to try. A fair could be coming to town. These aren't crucial things but they are fun things that help to improve your quality of life. 

Third, you should want to know what is going on because it helps you to be a better citizen. There's chances to maybe help out. You can volunteer at a local shelter or food bank. You could see that the community theater needs some volunteers. You could see that your local library needs some help. These are things that may interest you but you wouldn't know about them without watching the news.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, people should want to keep up with what is going on. They don't need to know what is happening everywhere but it's good to at least know what is happening locally. I think it's important to know what is going on in your community and state. 

First it's important to know what may be going on for your and your families safety. You should know what is happening with the pandemic. You need to know if there are any upcoming severe weather threats. You should know what is happening with your local government and what they are doing to help the community. These are all things that can affect you directly. 

Second, you'll want to know what is going on so you don't miss out on anything fun. You don't want to miss out on a great concert or festival. There could be a new restaurant opening up that you would want to try. A fair could be coming to town. These aren't crucial things but they are fun things that help to improve your quality of life. 

Third, you should want to know what is going on because it helps you to be a better citizen. There's chances to maybe help out. You can volunteer at a local shelter or food bank. You could see that the community theater needs some volunteers. You could see that your local library needs some help. These are things that may interest you but you wouldn't know about them without watching the news. 

Not following the news doesn't make you a bad citizen. It just means that you don't want to know what is going on.",api,26,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people should want to keep up with what is going on. They don't need to know what is happening everywhere but it's good to at least know what is happening locally. I think it's important to know what is going on in your community and state. 

First it's important to know what may be going on for your and your families safety. You should know what is happening with the pandemic. You need to know if there are any upcoming severe weather threats. You should know what is happening with your local government and what they are doing to help the community. These are all things that can affect you directly. 

Second, you'll want to know what is going on so you don't miss out on anything fun. You don't want to miss out on a great concert or festival. There could be a new restaurant opening up that you would want to try. A fair could be coming to town. These aren't crucial things but they are fun things that help to improve your quality of life. 

Third, you should want to know what is going on because it helps you to be a better citizen. There's chances to maybe help out. You can volunteer at a local shelter or food bank. You could see that the community theater needs some volunteers. You could see that your local library needs some help. These are things that may interest you but you wouldn't know about them without watching the news. 

Not following the news doesn't make you a bad citizen. It just means that you don't want to know what is going on. More than anything it just hurts you personally. You don't want to feel left out when your friends tell you about something fun that you never heard of. So I think overall it's just the right choice to watch the news.

In my opinion, people should want to keep up with what is going on. They don't need to know what is happening everywhere but it's good to at least know what is happening locally. I think it's important to know what is going on in your community and state. 

First it's important to know what may be going on for your and your families safety. You should know what is happening with the pandemic. You need to know if there are any upcoming severe weather threats. You should know what is happening with your local government and what they are doing to help the community. These are all things that can affect you directly. 

Second, you'll want to know what is going on so you don't miss out on anything fun. You don't want to miss out on a great concert or festival. There could be a new restaurant opening up that you would want to try. A fair could be coming to town. These aren't crucial things but they are fun things that help to improve your quality of life.

You could see that the community theater needs some volunteers. You could see that your local library needs some help. These are things that may interest you but you wouldn't know about them without watching the news.
