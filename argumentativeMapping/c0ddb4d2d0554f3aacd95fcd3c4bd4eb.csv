Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it's perfectly natural to want to save your pet over a foreign tourist. The study that was referenced fits in with what I believe to be true. If anything I'm surprised that only 40 percent of people feel this way. 
I think that the reason why people are more empathetic toward animals is because they can't speak for themselves.
 They can't say when they need help. They can't tell you that they are in pain. I believe we see them like children who are unable to tell us what is wrong. It makes us want to take care of them. We see them as innocent and pure. If we don't take care of them, who will?

I know people who are like me and mainly just donate to animal charities. That's perfectly okay to do and there's a reason behind it that fits in with the results of that study. People tend to give to charities that help hungry children or people half way across the world. Animals tend to be forgotten though in that regard. That's why many people like me give primarily to animal charities, because they need it the most.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it's perfectly natural to want to save your pet over a foreign tourist. The study that was referenced fits in with what I believe to be true. If anything I'm surprised that only 40 percent of people feel this way. 
I think that the reason why people are more empathetic toward animals is because they can't speak for themselves.
 They can't say when they need help. They can't tell you that they are in pain. I believe we see them like children who are unable to tell us what is wrong. It makes us want to take care of them. We see them as innocent and pure. If we don't take care of them, who will?

I know people who are like me and mainly just donate to animal charities. That's perfectly okay to do and there's a reason behind it that fits in with the results of that study. People tend to give to charities that help hungry children or people half way across the world. Animals tend to be forgotten though in that regard. That's why many people like me give primarily to animal charities, because they need it the most.

I think that the reason why people are more empathetic toward animals is because they can't speak for themselves.
 They can't say when they need help. They can't tell you that they are in pain. I believe we see them like children who are unable to tell us what is wrong. It makes us want to take care of them. We see them as innocent and pure. If we don't take care of them, who will?

I know people who are like me and mainly just donate to animal charities. That's perfectly okay to do and there's a reason behind it that fits in with the results of that study. People tend to give to charities that help hungry children or people half way across the world. Animals tend to be forgotten though in that regard. That's why many people like me give primarily to animal charities, because they need it the most. 

We need to focus on taking care of animals more. They aren't just our pets, they are living creatures. I feel that the study shows that 40% of people feel this way. That is encouraging to me. It makes me feel hopeful.

I think that the reason why people are more empathetic toward animals is because they can't speak for themselves.
 They can't say when they need help. They can't tell you that they are in pain. I believe we see them like children who are unable to tell us what is wrong. It makes us want to take care of them. We see them as innocent and pure. If we don't take care of them, who will?

I know people who are like me and mainly just donate to animal charities. That's perfectly okay to do and there's a reason behind it that fits in with the results of that study. People tend to give to charities that help hungry children or people half way across the world. Animals tend to be forgotten though in that regard. That's why many people like me give primarily to animal charities, because they need it the most. 

We need to focus on taking care of animals more. They aren't just our pets, they are living creatures. I feel that the study shows that 40% of people feel this way. That is encouraging to me. It makes me feel hopeful. 

So is it wrong to care about animals when humans are also suffering? No. We can care

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it's perfectly natural to want to save your pet over a foreign tourist. The study that was referenced fits in with what I believe to be true. If anything I'm surprised that only 40 percent of people feel this way. 
I think that the reason why people are more empathetic toward animals is because they can't speak for themselves.
 They can't say when they need help. They can't tell you that they are in pain. I believe we see them like children who are unable to tell us what is wrong. It makes us want to take care of them. We see them as innocent and pure. If we don't take care of them, who will?

I know people who are like me and mainly just donate to animal charities. That's perfectly okay to do and there's a reason behind it that fits in with the results of that study. People tend to give to charities that help hungry children or people half way across the world. Animals tend to be forgotten though in that regard. That's why many people like me give primarily to animal charities, because they need it the most. 

We need to focus on taking care of animals more. They aren't just our pets, they are living creatures. I feel that the study shows that 40% of people feel this way. That is encouraging to me. It makes me feel hopeful. 

So is it wrong to care about animals when humans are also suffering? No. We can care about all beings equally.

I think that the reason why people are more empathetic toward animals is because they can't speak for themselves.
 They can't say when they need help. They can't tell you that they are in pain. I believe we see them like children who are unable to tell us what is wrong. It makes us want to take care of them. We see them as innocent and pure. If we don't take care of them, who will?

I know people who are like me and mainly just donate to animal charities. That's perfectly okay to do and there's a reason behind it that fits in with the results of that study. People tend to give to charities that help hungry children or people half way across the world. Animals tend to be forgotten though in that regard. That's why many people like me give primarily to animal charities, because they need it the most. 

We need to focus on taking care of animals more. They aren't just our pets, they are living creatures. I feel that the study shows that 40% of people feel this way. That is encouraging to me. It makes me feel hopeful.

 They can't say when they need help. They can't tell you that they are in pain. I believe we see them like children who are unable to tell us what is wrong. It makes us want to take care of them. We see them as innocent and pure. If we don't take care of them, who will?

People tend to give to charities that help hungry children or people half way across the world. Animals tend to be forgotten though in that regard. That's why many people like me give primarily to animal charities, because they need it the most. 

We need to focus on taking care of animals more. They aren't just our pets, they are living creatures. I feel that the study shows that 40% of people feel this way. That is encouraging to me. It makes me feel hopeful.

In my opinion, it's perfectly natural to want to save your pet over a foreign tourist. The study that was referenced fits in with what I believe to be true. If anything I'm surprised that only 40 percent of people feel this way. 
I think that the reason why people are more empathetic toward animals is because they can't speak for themselves.
 They can't say when they need help. They can't tell you that they are in pain. I believe we see them like children who are unable to tell us what is wrong. It makes us want to take care of them. We see them as innocent and pure. If we don't take care of them, who will?

I know people who are like me and mainly just donate to animal charities. That's perfectly okay to do and there's a reason behind it that fits in with the results of that study. People tend to give to charities that help hungry children or people half way across the world. Animals tend to be forgotten though in that regard. That's why many people like me give primarily to animal charities, because they need it the most. 

We need to focus on taking care of animals more. They aren't just our pets, they are living creatures. I feel that the study shows that 40% of people feel this way. That is encouraging to me. It makes me feel hopeful. 

So is it wrong to care about animals when humans are also suffering? No. We can care about all beings equally. Sometimes we just need to focus on the ones who are being overlooked though

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it's perfectly natural to want to save your pet over a foreign tourist. The study that was referenced fits in with what I believe to be true. If anything I'm surprised that only 40 percent of people feel this way. 
I think that the reason why people are more empathetic toward animals is because they can't speak for themselves.
 They can't say when they need help. They can't tell you that they are in pain. I believe we see them like children who are unable to tell us what is wrong. It makes us want to take care of them. We see them as innocent and pure. If we don't take care of them, who will?

I know people who are like me and mainly just donate to animal charities. That's perfectly okay to do and there's a reason behind it that fits in with the results of that study. People tend to give to charities that help hungry children or people half way across the world. Animals tend to be forgotten though in that regard. That's why many people like me give primarily to animal charities, because they need it the most. 

We need to focus on taking care of animals more. They aren't just our pets, they are living creatures. I feel that the study shows that 40% of people feel this way. That is encouraging to me. It makes me feel hopeful. 

So is it wrong to care about animals when humans are also suffering? No. We can care about all beings equally. Sometimes we just need to focus on the ones who are being overlooked though. If

 They can't say when they need help. They can't tell you that they are in pain. I believe we see them like children who are unable to tell us what is wrong. It makes us want to take care of them. We see them as innocent and pure. If we don't take care of them, who will?

I know people who are like me and mainly just donate to animal charities. That's perfectly okay to do and there's a reason behind it that fits in with the results of that study. People tend to give to charities that help hungry children or people half way across the world. Animals tend to be forgotten though in that regard. That's why many people like me give primarily to animal charities, because they need it the most.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it's perfectly natural to want to save your pet over a foreign tourist. The study that was referenced fits in with what I believe to be true. If anything I'm surprised that only 40 percent of people feel this way. 
I think that the reason why people are more empathetic toward animals is because they can't speak for themselves.
 They can't say when they need help. They can't tell you that they are in pain. I believe we see them like children who are unable to tell us what is wrong. It makes us want to take care of them. We see them as innocent and pure. If we don't take care of them, who will?

I know people who are like me and mainly just donate to animal charities. That's perfectly okay to do and there's a reason behind it that fits in with the results of that study. People tend to give to charities that help hungry children or people half way across the world. Animals tend to be forgotten though in that regard. That's why many people like me give primarily to animal charities, because they need it the most. 

We need to focus on taking care of animals more. They aren't just our pets, they are living creatures. I feel that the study shows that 40% of people feel this way. That is encouraging to me. It makes me feel hopeful. 

So is it wrong to care about animals when humans are also suffering? No. We can care about all beings equally. Sometimes we just need to focus on the ones who are being overlooked though. If an animals is not getting n

 They can't say when they need help. They can't tell you that they are in pain. I believe we see them like children who are unable to tell us what is wrong. It makes us want to take care of them. We see them as innocent and pure. If we don't take care of them, who will?

I know people who are like me and mainly just donate to animal charities. That's perfectly okay to do and there's a reason behind it that fits in with the results of that study. People tend to give to charities that help hungry children or people half way across the world. Animals tend to be forgotten though in that regard. That's why many people like me give primarily to animal charities, because they need it the most. 

We need to focus on taking care of animals more. They aren't just our pets, they are living creatures. I feel that the study shows that 40% of people feel this way. That is encouraging to me. It makes me feel hopeful.

 They can't say when they need help. They can't tell you that they are in pain. I believe we see them like children who are unable to tell us what is wrong. It makes us want to take care of them. We see them as innocent and pure. If we don't take care of them, who will?

I know people who are like me and mainly just donate to animal charities. That's perfectly okay to do and there's a reason behind it that fits in with the results of that study. People tend to give to charities that help hungry children or people half way across the world. Animals tend to be forgotten though in that regard. That's why many people like me give primarily to animal charities, because they need it the most. 

We need to focus on taking care of animals more. They aren't just our pets, they are living creatures. I feel that the study shows that 40% of people feel this way. That is encouraging to me. It makes me feel hopeful. 

So is it wrong to care about animals when humans are also suffering? No. We can care about all beings equally. Sometimes we just need to focus on the ones who are being overlooked though.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it's perfectly natural to want to save your pet over a foreign tourist. The study that was referenced fits in with what I believe to be true. If anything I'm surprised that only 40 percent of people feel this way. 
I think that the reason why people are more empathetic toward animals is because they can't speak for themselves.
 They can't say when they need help. They can't tell you that they are in pain. I believe we see them like children who are unable to tell us what is wrong. It makes us want to take care of them. We see them as innocent and pure. If we don't take care of them, who will?

I know people who are like me and mainly just donate to animal charities. That's perfectly okay to do and there's a reason behind it that fits in with the results of that study. People tend to give to charities that help hungry children or people half way across the world. Animals tend to be forgotten though in that regard. That's why many people like me give primarily to animal charities, because they need it the most. 

We need to focus on taking care of animals more. They aren't just our pets, they are living creatures. I feel that the study shows that 40% of people feel this way. That is encouraging to me. It makes me feel hopeful. 

So is it wrong to care about animals when humans are also suffering? No. We can care about all beings equally. Sometimes we just need to focus on the ones who are being overlooked though. If an animals is not getting noticed or helped as much as humans then it's our job to step up and put them first. It's no different than trying to help with equalit

In my opinion, it's perfectly natural to want to save your pet over a foreign tourist. The study that was referenced fits in with what I believe to be true. If anything I'm surprised that only 40 percent of people feel this way. 
I think that the reason why people are more empathetic toward animals is because they can't speak for themselves.
 They can't say when they need help. They can't tell you that they are in pain. I believe we see them like children who are unable to tell us what is wrong. It makes us want to take care of them. We see them as innocent and pure. If we don't take care of them, who will?

I know people who are like me and mainly just donate to animal charities. That's perfectly okay to do and there's a reason behind it that fits in with the results of that study. People tend to give to charities that help hungry children or people half way across the world. Animals tend to be forgotten though in that regard. That's why many people like me give primarily to animal charities, because they need it the most. 

We need to focus on taking care of animals more. They aren't just our pets, they are living creatures. I feel that the study shows that 40% of people feel this way. That is encouraging to me. It makes me feel hopeful. 

So is it wrong to care about animals when humans are also suffering? No. We can care about all beings equally. Sometimes we just need to focus on the ones who are being overlooked though. If an animals is not getting noticed or helped as much as humans then it's our job to step up and put them first. It's no different than trying to help with equality between humans. Leta so

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

People tend to give to charities that help hungry children or people half way across the world. Animals tend to be forgotten though in that regard.

In my opinion, it's perfectly natural to want to save your pet over a foreign tourist. The study that was referenced fits in with what I believe to be true. If anything I'm surprised that only 40 percent of people feel this way. 
I think that the reason why people are more empathetic toward animals is because they can't speak for themselves.
 They can't say when they need help. They can't tell you that they are in pain. I believe we see them like children who are unable to tell us what is wrong. It makes us want to take care of them. We see them as innocent and pure. If we don't take care of them, who will?

I know people who are like me and mainly just donate to animal charities. That's perfectly okay to do and there's a reason behind it that fits in with the results of that study. People tend to give to charities that help hungry children or people half way across the world. Animals tend to be forgotten though in that regard. That's why many people like me give primarily to animal charities, because they need it the most. 

We need to focus on taking care of animals more. They aren't just our pets, they are living creatures. I feel that the study shows that 40% of people feel this way. That is encouraging to me. It makes me feel hopeful. 

So is it wrong to care about animals when humans are also suffering? No. We can care about all beings equally. Sometimes we just need to focus on the ones who are being overlooked though. If an animals is not getting noticed or helped as much as humans then it's our job to step up and put them first. It's no different than trying to help with equality between humans. Lets aim for equality amon

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

So is it wrong to care about animals when humans are also suffering? No. We can care about all beings equally. Sometimes we just need to focus on the ones who are being overlooked though.

I think that the reason why people are more empathetic toward animals is because they can't speak for themselves.
 They can't say when they need help. They can't tell you that they are in pain. I believe we see them like children who are unable to tell us what is wrong. It makes us want to take care of them. We see them as innocent and pure. If we don't take care of them, who will?
