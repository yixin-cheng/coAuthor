What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, its the stereotypical token black guy. In a group of 4 or 5 white people, there is always the one black guy. I grew up watching this thinking nothing of it even though I went to a highly integrated school.  The same thing seemed to happen at school, there would be clicks of white kids with one black kid in their group, usually a boy. It makes me wonder now if the shows we were watching influenced that behavior. I think so and it is damaging. Usually the African American/Token black guy is a basic, one sided character with a few funny catch phrases. Usually nothing more from my experience. I really started to notice it toward the end of high school and then it became a known thing in college. It was something we were all aware of, realized it was probably not right but still perpetuated it out of habit. I think it is a subconscious thing that we are not aware of when making friends, it just kind of happened. These black friends were more then token black friends to us though. They were full human beings like the rest of us. I look back and wish we included more minorities in our groups. We would have all been better for it. Unfortunetly blacks are still second rate citizens and these sterotypes do not help in any way. We need to give minorities more prominent roles in entertainment. If we dot will eventually spill over into the real world. ",user,21,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1
