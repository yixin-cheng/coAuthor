In my opinion,  there are many important things that students should learn in school.  However students need to come out of school with at least the basics, certainly Math and English skills, read and writing.  These simple skills, if properly taught, will serve all students through their working life and beyond.  Employers and colleges will recognize and reward the basics taught in school.  With the foundations in place students can pursue whatever they want, further education, or a career.  At times, too much energy is expended in schools in teaching skills that are too abstract from our real life, and have little purpose, other than for the teacher to lead the class.  I believe that teachers should emphasize the essentials, instead of tossing in everything except the kitchen sink. If students want more, then they will have the opportunity to seek this out for themselves, and with the basic skills in hand, taught to a high level, they can go where ever they want.  For these reasons, I believe that Math and English are the most important things that students should learn in school.",user,10,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion,  there are many important things that students should learn in school.  However students need to come out of school with at least the basics, certainly Math and English skills, read and writing.  These simple skills, if properly taught, will serve all students through their working life and beyond.  Employers and colleges will recognize and reward the basics taught in school.  With the foundations in place students can pursue whatever they want, further education, or a career.  At times, too much energy is expended in schools in teaching skills that are too abstract from our real lives, and they serve little purpose, other than for the teacher to lead the class.  I believe that teachers should emphasize the essentials, instead of tossing in everything except the kitchen sink. If students want more, then they will have the opportunity to seek this out for themselves, and with the basic skills in hand, taught to a high level, they can go where ever they want.
