In my opinion, listening gives me at least a broad range of thinking, When i read a book my mind tend to stray a lot but when i listening i feel i can imagine myself in the story and play the role of the character. I also have the option of not being tethered to a book and can walk around listening to it.  also think listening is good for people who can't read or have a hard time reading.
 For me listening to an audiobook on the treadmill just makes the time go buy super fast and its also a time killer to say. I am usually a visually person meaning videos help me cram info better than writing , i would also say i'm a listening person as well . So when listening i could hold things better than reading it. I also think listening to an audiobook is good for people who are in a hurry and don't have time to read. There are a wide array of advantages of listening, meaning it can be done on the go and from everywhere. When i have the choice i always go for listening to books and or podcast.

In my opinion, listening gives me at least a broad range of thinking, When i read a book my mind tend to stray a lot but when i listening i feel i can imagine myself in the story and play the role of the character. I also have the option of not being tethered to a book and can walk around listening to it.  also think listening is good for people who can't read or have a hard time reading.
 For me listening to an audiobook on the treadmill just makes the time go buy super fast and its also a time killer to say. I am usually a visually person meaning videos help me cram info better than writing , i would also say i'm a listening person as well . So when listening i could hold things better than reading it. I also think listening to an audiobook is good for people who are in a hurry and don't have time to read. There are a wide array of advantages of listening, meaning it can be done on the go and from everywhere. When i have the choice i always go for listening to books and or podcast.

I also have the option of not being tethered to a book and can walk around listening to it.  also think listening is good for people who can't read or have a hard time reading.
 For me listening to an audiobook on the treadmill just makes the time go buy super fast and its also a time killer to say.

In my opinion, listening gives me at least a broad range of thinking, When i read a book my mind tend to stray a lot but when i listening i feel i can imagine myself in the story and play the role of the character. I also have the option of not being tethered to a book and can walk around listening to it.  also think listening is good for people who can't read or have a hard time reading.
 For me listening to an audiobook on the treadmill just makes the time go buy super fast and its also a time killer to say. I am usually a visually person meaning videos help me cram info better than writing , i would also say i'm a listening person as well . So when listening i could hold things better than reading it. I also think listening to an audiobook is good for people who are in a hurry and don't have time to read. There are a wide array of advantages of listening, meaning it can be done on the go and from everywhere. When i have the choice i always go for listening to books and or podcast. The Audible app is godsent in my opinion, i find myself listening to so much more books that are sometimes free or have a promotion. I also find myself not buying the amount of books that i use to in the past since this new technology came about. I also find myself listening to books that i wouldn't have read in the past.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, listening gives me at least a broad range of thinking, When i read a book my mind tend to stray a lot but when i listening i feel i can imagine myself in the story and play the role of the character. I also have the option of not being tethered to a book and can walk around listening to it.  also think listening is good for people who can't read or have a hard time reading.
 For me listening to an audiobook on the treadmill just makes the time go buy super fast and its also a time killer to say. I am usually a visually person meaning videos help me cram info better than writing , i would also say i'm a listening person as well . So when listening i could hold things better than reading it. I also think listening to an audiobook is good for people who are in a hurry and don't have time to read. There are a wide array of advantages of listening, meaning it can be done on the go and from everywhere. When i have the choice i always go for listening to books and or podcast. The Audible app is godsent in my opinion, i find myself listening to so much more books that are sometimes free or have a promotion. I also find myself not buying the amount of books that i use to in the past since this new technology came about. I also find myself listening to books that i wouldn't have read in the past. I will also be teaching my kids how to listen more to audiobooks as they are not the ones to sit and read a book for hours on end anymore. So i feel there is a lot of good to come out of listening as they can do it while on the way and back from school .

In my opinion, listening gives me at least a broad range of thinking, When i read a book my mind tend to stray a lot but when i listening i feel i can imagine myself in the story and play the role of the character.

 For me listening to an audiobook on the treadmill just makes the time go buy super fast and its also a time killer to say. I am usually a visually person meaning videos help me cram info better than writing , i would also say i'm a listening person as well . So when listening i could hold things better than reading it. I also think listening to an audiobook is good for people who are in a hurry and don't have time to read.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, listening gives me at least a broad range of thinking, When i read a book my mind tend to stray a lot but when i listening i feel i can imagine myself in the story and play the role of the character. I also have the option of not being tethered to a book and can walk around listening to it.  also think listening is good for people who can't read or have a hard time reading.
