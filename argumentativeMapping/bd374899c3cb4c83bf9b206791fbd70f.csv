What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a group of people is the portrayal of the mentally ill. The portrayal of mentally ill persons in the media is usually negative and inaccurate. Even sometimes it is offensive and misleading.  Films from the 90s and early 2000s such as Girl, Interrupted and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest are examples of this. Mental illness is often something people deal struggle with internally, while these films portray the mentally ill as violent, dangerous and unpredictable, often resorting to institutionalizing the affected person. 
In the film Girl, Interrupted, Susanna Kaysen is a young woman who is institutionalized after a suicide attempt.
