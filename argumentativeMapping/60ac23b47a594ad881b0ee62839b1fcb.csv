What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outli",user,9,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

And lastly, I cringe about how the typical gay bestie in rom-coms are typically the ones that are very out there with the flamboyancy, and they scream ""Hooker Queen"" with their over the top outfits and make-up. They are usually very sex-pos",user,12,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

And lastly, I cringe about how the typical gay bestie in rom-coms are typically the ones that are very out there with the flamboyancy, and they scream ""Hooker Queen"" with their over the top outfits and make-up. They are usually very sex-positive and is the go-to ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted.

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

And lastly, I cringe about how the typical gay bestie in rom-coms are typically the ones that are very out there with the flamboyancy, and they scream ""Hooker Queen"" with their over the top outfits and make-up. They are usually very sex-positive and is the go-to advice giver when it comes to the guy's wardrobe or his accessories.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

And lastly, I cringe about how the typical gay bestie in rom-coms are typically the ones that are very out there with the flamboyancy, and they scream ""Hooker Queen"" with their over the top outfits and make-up. They are usually very sex-positive and is the go-to advice giver when it comes to the guy's wardrobe or his accessories.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

And lastly, I cringe about how the typical gay bestie in rom-coms are typically the ones that are very out there with the flamboyancy, and they scream ""Hooker Queen"" with their over the top outfits and make-up. They are usually very sex-positive and is the go-to advice giver when it comes to the guy's wardrobe or his accessories.

Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

And lastly, I cringe about how the typical gay bestie in rom-coms are typically the ones that are very out there with the flamboyancy, and they scream ""Hooker Queen"" with their over the top outfits and make-up. They are usually very sex-positive and is the go-to advice giver when it comes to the guy's wardrobe or his accessories. It's a stereotype that needs to die, as it's making the hardworking LGBT actors and actresses that deserve better, while also giving tired-of-the-mark gay actors and actresses that only want to play a great role and be great actors, only to be denied of the chance because they are so easily pigeon-holed in these movies.

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

And lastly, I cringe about how the typical gay bestie in rom-coms are typically the ones that are very out there with the flamboyancy, and they scream ""Hooker Queen"" with their over the top outfits and make-up. They are usually very sex-positive and is the go-to advice giver when it comes to the guy's wardrobe or his accessories. It's a stereotype that needs to die, as it's making the hardworking LGBT actors and actresses that deserve better, while also giving tired-of-the-mark gay actors and actresses that only want to play a great role and be great actors, only to be denied of the chance because they are so easily pigeon-holed in these movies.

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

And lastly, I cringe about how the typical gay bestie in rom-coms are typically the ones that are very out there with the flamboyancy, and they scream ""Hooker Queen"" with their over the top outfits and make-up. They are usually very sex-positive and is the go-to advice giver when it comes to the guy's wardrobe or his accessories. It's a stereotype that needs to die, as it's making the hardworking LGBT actors and actresses that deserve better, while also giving tired-of-the-mark gay actors and actresses that only want to play a great role and be great actors, only to be denied of the chance because they are so easily pigeon-holed in these movies.

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting.

Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

And lastly, I cringe about how the typical gay bestie in rom-coms are typically the ones that are very out there with the flamboyancy, and they scream ""Hooker Queen"" with their over the top outfits and make-up. They are usually very sex-positive and is the go-to advice giver when it comes to the guy's wardrobe or his accessories. It's a stereotype that needs to die, as it's making the hardworking LGBT actors and actresses that deserve better, while also giving tired-of-the-mark gay actors and actresses that only want to play a great role and be great actors, only to be denied of the chance because they are so easily pigeon-holed in these movies.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

And lastly, I cringe about how the typical gay bestie in rom-coms are typically the ones that are very out there with the flamboyancy, and they scream ""Hooker Queen"" with their over the top outfits and make-up. They are usually very sex-positive and is the go-to advice giver when it comes to the guy's wardrobe or his accessories. It's a stereotype that needs to die, as it's making the hardworking LGBT actors and actresses that deserve better, while also giving tired-of-the-mark gay actors and actresses that only want to play a great role and be great actors, only to be denied of the chance because they are so easily pigeon-holed in these movies.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

And lastly, I cringe about how the typical gay bestie in rom-coms are typically the ones that are very out there with the flamboyancy, and they scream ""Hooker Queen"" with their over the top outfits and make-up. They are usually very sex-positive and is the go-to advice giver when it comes to the guy's wardrobe or his accessories. It's a stereotype that needs to die, as it's making the hardworking LGBT actors and actresses that deserve better, while also giving tired-of-the-mark gay actors and actresses that only want to play a great role and be great actors, only to be denied of the chance because they are so easily pigeon-holed in these movies.

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

And lastly, I cringe about how the typical gay bestie in rom-coms are typically the ones that are very out there with the flamboyancy, and they scream ""Hooker Queen"" with their over the top outfits and make-up. They are usually very sex-positive and is the go-to advice giver when it comes to the guy's wardrobe or his accessories.

How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting.

How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

And lastly, I cringe about how the typical gay bestie in rom-coms are typically the ones that are very out there with the flamboyancy, and they scream ""Hooker Queen"" with their over the top outfits and make-up. They are usually very sex-positive and is the go-to advice giver when it comes to the guy's wardrobe or his accessories. It's a stereotype that needs to die, as it's making the hardworking LGBT actors and actresses that deserve better, while also giving tired-of-the-mark gay actors and actresses that only want to play a great role and be great actors, only to be denied of the chance because they are so easily pigeon-holed in these movies.

So to summarize my point, let's just remove the gay bestie trope in any form of media from now on. ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It's a stereotype that needs to die, as it's making the hardworking LGBT actors and actresses that deserve better, while also giving tired-of-the-mark gay actors and actresses that only want to play a great role and be great actors, only to be denied of the chance because they are so easily pigeon-holed in these movies.

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

And lastly, I cringe about how the typical gay bestie in rom-coms are typically the ones that are very out there with the flamboyancy, and they scream ""Hooker Queen"" with their over the top outfits and make-up. They are usually very sex-positive and is the go-to advice giver when it comes to the guy's wardrobe or his accessories. It's a stereotype that needs to die, as it's making the hardworking LGBT actors and actresses that deserve better, while also giving tired-of-the-mark gay actors and actresses that only want to play a great role and be great actors, only to be denied of the chance because they are so easily pigeon-holed in these movies.

So to summarize my point, let's just remove the gay bestie trope in any form of media from now on. We've had enough and it's",user,15,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted.

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

And lastly, I cringe about how the typical gay bestie in rom-coms are typically the ones that are very out there with the flamboyancy, and they scream ""Hooker Queen"" with their over the top outfits and make-up. They are usually very sex-positive and is the go-to advice giver when it comes to the guy's wardrobe or his accessories. It's a stereotype that needs to die, as it's making the hardworking LGBT actors and actresses that deserve better, while also giving tired-of-the-mark gay actors and actresses that only want to play a great role and be great actors, only to be denied of the chance because they are so easily pigeon-holed in these movies.

So to summarize my point, let's just remove the gay bestie trope in any form of media from now on. We've had enough and it's time for gay characters ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

And lastly, I cringe about how the typical gay bestie in rom-coms are typically the ones that are very out there with the flamboyancy, and they scream ""Hooker Queen"" with their over the top outfits and make-up. They are usually very sex-positive and is the go-to advice giver when it comes to the guy's wardrobe or his accessories. It's a stereotype that needs to die, as it's making the hardworking LGBT actors and actresses that deserve better, while also giving tired-of-the-mark gay actors and actresses that only want to play a great role and be great actors, only to be denied of the chance because they are so easily pigeon-holed in these movies.

So to summarize my point, let's just remove the gay bestie trope in any form of media from now on. We've had enough and it's time for gay characters to evolve. M",user,16,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device.

It's a stereotype that needs to die, as it's making the hardworking LGBT actors and actresses that deserve better, while also giving tired-of-the-mark gay actors and actresses that only want to play a great role and be great actors, only to be denied of the chance because they are so easily pigeon-holed in these movies.

So to summarize my point, let's just remove the gay bestie trope in any form of media from now on. We've had enough and it's time for gay characters to evolve. Make peopel",user,16,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

And lastly, I cringe about how the typical gay bestie in rom-coms are typically the ones that are very out there with the flamboyancy, and they scream ""Hooker Queen"" with their over the top outfits and make-up. They are usually very sex-positive and is the go-to advice giver when it comes to the guy's wardrobe or his accessories. It's a stereotype that needs to die, as it's making the hardworking LGBT actors and actresses that deserve better, while also giving tired-of-the-mark gay actors and actresses that only want to play a great role and be great actors, only to be denied of the chance because they are so easily pigeon-holed in these movies.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

And lastly, I cringe about how the typical gay bestie in rom-coms are typically the ones that are very out there with the flamboyancy, and they scream ""Hooker Queen"" with their over the top outfits and make-up. They are usually very sex-positive and is the go-to advice giver when it comes to the guy's wardrobe or his accessories. It's a stereotype that needs to die, as it's making the hardworking LGBT actors and actresses that deserve better, while also giving tired-of-the-mark gay actors and actresses that only want to play a great role and be great actors, only to be denied of the chance because they are so easily pigeon-holed in these movies.

So to summarize my point, let's just remove the gay bestie trope in any form of media from now on. We've had enough and it's time for gay characters to evolve. Make people be LGBT ch",user,16,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

And lastly, I cringe about how the typical gay bestie in rom-coms are typically the ones that are very out there with the flamboyancy, and they scream ""Hooker Queen"" with their over the top outfits and make-up. They are usually very sex-positive and is the go-to advice giver when it comes to the guy's wardrobe or his accessories. It's a stereotype that needs to die, as it's making the hardworking LGBT actors and actresses that deserve better, while also giving tired-of-the-mark gay actors and actresses that only want to play a great role and be great actors, only to be denied of the chance because they are so easily pigeon-holed in these movies.

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device.

And lastly, I cringe about how the typical gay bestie in rom-coms are typically the ones that are very out there with the flamboyancy, and they scream ""Hooker Queen"" with their over the top outfits and make-up. They are usually very sex-positive and is the go-to advice giver when it comes to the guy's wardrobe or his accessories.

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

And lastly, I cringe about how the typical gay bestie in rom-coms are typically the ones that are very out there with the flamboyancy, and they scream ""Hooker Queen"" with their over the top outfits and make-up. They are usually very sex-positive and is the go-to advice giver when it comes to the guy's wardrobe or his accessories.

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

And lastly, I cringe about how the typical gay bestie in rom-coms are typically the ones that are very out there with the flamboyancy, and they scream ""Hooker Queen"" with their over the top outfits and make-up. They are usually very sex-positive and is the go-to advice giver when it comes to the guy's wardrobe or his accessories. It's a stereotype that needs to die, as it's making the hardworking LGBT actors and actresses that deserve better, while also giving tired-of-the-mark gay actors and actresses that only want to play a great role and be great actors, only to be denied of the chance because they are so easily pigeon-holed in these movies.

So to summarize my point, let's just remove the gay bestie trope in any form of media from now on. We've had enough and it's time for gay characters to evolve. Make people be LGBT characters just because they can and not because they have to due to a need for a sidekick. It's time to ",user,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.
