In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, no, we are not being bad citizens by not watching the news.  People surely have a responsibility to pay attention to their community and to what's going on around them, but this can be done without watching world news or interacting with technology in any way. Just paying attention to what's going on in our environment will do just fine. 

I feel that the news outlets these days vary so much in their interpretation that this whole idea of ""news"" has become more and more warped. It's also really hard to separate the information from the commentary about it on some outlets. Surely avoiding this charade does not make someone a bad citizen. aying attention and being connected to our communities alone will do a lot to keep our citizens informed.
 But watching all of the negative commentary embedded within the news can actually hurt communities by deepening an already existing political divide.

In my opinion, no, we are not being bad citizens by not watching the news.

Just paying attention to what's going on in our environment will do just fine. 

I feel that the news outlets these days vary so much in their interpretation that this whole idea of ""news"" has become more and more warped.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, no, we are not being bad citizens by not watching the news.  People surely have a responsibility to pay attention to their community and to what's going on around them, but this can be done without watching world news or interacting with technology in any way. Just paying attention to what's going on in our environment will do just fine. 

I feel that the news outlets these days vary so much in their interpretation that this whole idea of ""news"" has become more and more warped. It's also really hard to separate the information from the commentary about it on some outlets. Surely avoiding this charade does not make someone a bad citizen. aying attention and being connected to our communities alone will do a lot to keep our citizens informed.
 But watching all of the negative commentary embedded within the news can actually hurt communities by deepening an already existing political divide. 

Engaging with current event can be more helpful on a local level, for example if you are helping feed people in your community because of a tragedy. This, also, can be done simply by paying attention and does not have to involve consuming the news.

In my opinion, no, we are not being bad citizens by not watching the news.

People surely have a responsibility to pay attention to their community and to what's going on around them, but this can be done without watching world news or interacting with technology in any way.
