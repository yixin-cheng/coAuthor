Climate change is making the planet uninhabitable, terror groups roam swathes of the Earth virulent and unchecked, and political opportunists publish lies that weaponize the stupid. Any level-headed reading of recent news will surely convince you things are hopeless. So, why read news at all?

Unfortunately, not reading the news comes with its own risks. If you don't know what's going on, things can, well, catch you by surprise. You can catch COVID if you didn't know about prevention, or can be thought a fool if you can't carry a literate conversation at an after-work party.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Sure: it makes you depressed and hopeless. Let's face it, the world is going straight to hell. Climate change is making the planet uninhabitable, terror groups roam swathes of the Earth virulent and unchecked, and political opportunists publish lies that weaponize the stupid. Any level-headed reading of recent news will surely convince you things are hopeless. So, why read news at all?

Unfortunately, not reading the news comes with its own risks. If you don't know what's going on, things can, well, catch you by surprise. You can catch COVID if you didn't know about prevention, or can be thought a fool if you can't carry a literate conversation at an after-work party.

So what's the solution? How can you be informed without being hopeless? How can you carry a literate conversation without making yourself miserable?

Any level-headed reading of recent news will surely convince you things are hopeless. So, why read news at all?

Unfortunately, not reading the news comes with its own risks. If you don't know what's going on, things can, well, catch you by surprise. You can catch COVID if you didn't know about prevention, or can be thought a fool if you can't carry a literate conversation at an after-work party.

So what's the solution? How can you be informed without being hopeless? How can you carry a literate conversation without making yourself miserable?

 develop a list of literate-sounding things to say, memorize, and deploy them. That's how most people sound intelligent at parties after all.

Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Sure: it makes you depressed and hopeless. Let's face it, the world is going straight to hell. Climate change is making the planet uninhabitable, terror groups roam swathes of the Earth virulent and unchecked, and political opportunists publish lies that weaponize the stupid. Any level-headed reading of recent news will surely convince you things are hopeless. So, why read news at all?

Unfortunately, not reading the news comes with its own risks. If you don't know what's going on, things can, well, catch you by surprise. You can catch COVID if you didn't know about prevention, or can be thought a fool if you can't carry a literate conversation at an after-work party.

So what's the solution? How can you be informed without being hopeless? How can you carry a literate conversation without making yourself miserable?

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Sure: it makes you depressed and hopeless. Let's face it, the world is going straight to hell. Climate change is making the planet uninhabitable, terror groups roam swathes of the Earth virulent and unchecked, and political opportunists publish lies that weaponize the stupid. Any level-headed reading of recent news will surely convince you things are hopeless. So, why read news at all?

Unfortunately, not reading the news comes with its own risks. If you don't know what's going on, things can, well, catch you by surprise. You can catch COVID if you didn't know about prevention, or can be thought a fool if you can't carry a literate conversation at an after-work party.

So what's the solution? How can you be informed without being hopeless? How can you carry a literate conversation without making yourself miserable?

Climate change is making the planet uninhabitable, terror groups roam swathes of the Earth virulent and unchecked, and political opportunists publish lies that weaponize the stupid. Any level-headed reading of recent news will surely convince you things are hopeless. So, why read news at all?

Unfortunately, not reading the news comes with its own risks. If you don't know what's going on, things can, well, catch you by surprise. You can catch COVID if you didn't know about prevention, or can be thought a fool if you can't carry a literate conversation at an after-work party.

So what's the solution? How can you be informed without being hopeless? How can you carry a literate conversation without making yourself miserable?
Here's how:
 develop a list of literate-sounding things to say, memorize, and deploy them. That's how most people sound intelligent at parties after all. Practice saying things like: ""I've never heard that put so well before,"" ""Yes, we live in interesting times, don't we,"" and ""That's just so interesting,"" to name just three.

Any level-headed reading of recent news will surely convince you things are hopeless. So, why read news at all?

Unfortunately, not reading the news comes with its own risks. If you don't know what's going on, things can, well, catch you by surprise. You can catch COVID if you didn't know about prevention, or can be thought a fool if you can't carry a literate conversation at an after-work party.

So what's the solution? How can you be informed without being hopeless? How can you carry a literate conversation without making yourself miserable?
Here's how:
 develop a list of literate-sounding things to say, memorize, and deploy them. That's how most people sound intelligent at parties after all. Practice saying things like: ""I've never heard that put so well before,"" ""Yes, we live in interesting times, don't we,"" and ""That's just so interesting,"" to name just three.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Sure: it makes you depressed and hopeless. Let's face it, the world is going straight to hell. Climate change is making the planet uninhabitable, terror groups roam swathes of the Earth virulent and unchecked, and political opportunists publish lies that weaponize the stupid. Any level-headed reading of recent news will surely convince you things are hopeless. So, why read news at all?

Unfortunately, not reading the news comes with its own risks. If you don't know what's going on, things can, well, catch you by surprise. You can catch COVID if you didn't know about prevention, or can be thought a fool if you can't carry a literate conversation at an after-work party.

So what's the solution? How can you be informed without being hopeless? How can you carry a literate conversation without making yourself miserable?
Here's how:
 develop a list of literate-sounding things to say, memorize, and deploy them. That's how most people sound intelligent at parties after all. Practice saying things like: ""I've never heard that put so well before,"" ""Yes, we live in interesting times, don't we,"" and ""That's just so interesting,"" to name just three.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Sure: it makes you depressed and hopeless. Let's face it, the world is going straight to hell. Climate change is making the planet uninhabitable, terror groups roam swathes of the Earth virulent and unchecked, and political opportunists publish lies that weaponize the stupid. Any level-headed reading of recent news will surely convince you things are hopeless. So, why read news at all?

Unfortunately, not reading the news comes with its own risks. If you don't know what's going on, things can, well, catch you by surprise. You can catch COVID if you didn't know about prevention, or can be thought a fool if you can't carry a literate conversation at an after-work party.

So what's the solution? How can you be informed without being hopeless? How can you carry a literate conversation without making yourself miserable?

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Sure: it makes you depressed and hopeless. Let's face it, the world is going straight to hell. Climate change is making the planet uninhabitable, terror groups roam swathes of the Earth virulent and unchecked, and political opportunists publish lies that weaponize the stupid. Any level-headed reading of recent news will surely convince you things are hopeless. So, why read news at all?

So what's the solution? How can you be informed without being hopeless? How can you carry a literate conversation without making yourself miserable?

Practice saying things like: ""I've never heard that put so well before,"" ""Yes, we live in interesting times, don't we,"" and ""That's just so interesting,"" to name just three.

You can seem to be in the know, when in reality you haven't looked at the news in decades. I mean, you'll be dead in the end anyway, and reading the news won't change that. So why not hit the retirement years worry free — or as worry free as possible anyway.
If you choose that route remember: always answer in the affirmative, it is the path of least resistance.
 It's much easier to say ""yes"" than to offer a dissenting opinion.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Sure: it makes you depressed and hopeless. Let's face it, the world is going straight to hell. Climate change is making the planet uninhabitable, terror groups roam swathes of the Earth virulent and unchecked, and political opportunists publish lies that weaponize the stupid. Any level-headed reading of recent news will surely convince you things are hopeless. So, why read news at all?

Unfortunately, not reading the news comes with its own risks. If you don't know what's going on, things can, well, catch you by surprise. You can catch COVID if you didn't know about prevention, or can be thought a fool if you can't carry a literate conversation at an after-work party.

So what's the solution? How can you be informed without being hopeless? How can you carry a literate conversation without making yourself miserable?

Climate change is making the planet uninhabitable, terror groups roam swathes of the Earth virulent and unchecked, and political opportunists publish lies that weaponize the stupid. Any level-headed reading of recent news will surely convince you things are hopeless. So, why read news at all?

Unfortunately, not reading the news comes with its own risks. If you don't know what's going on, things can, well, catch you by surprise. You can catch COVID if you didn't know about prevention, or can be thought a fool if you can't carry a literate conversation at an after-work party.

So what's the solution? How can you be informed without being hopeless? How can you carry a literate conversation without making yourself miserable?
Here's how:
 develop a list of literate-sounding things to say, memorize, and deploy them. That's how most people sound intelligent at parties after all. Practice saying things like: ""I've never heard that put so well before,"" ""Yes, we live in interesting times, don't we,"" and ""That's just so interesting,"" to name just three.

You can seem to be in the know, when in reality you haven't looked at the news in decades. I mean, you'll be dead in the end anyway, and reading the news won't change that. So why not hit the retirement years worry free — or as worry free as possible anyway.
If you choose that route remember: always answer in the affirmative, it is the path of least resistance.
 It's much easier to say ""yes"" than to offer a dissenting opinion.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Sure: it makes you depressed and hopeless. Let's face it, the world is going straight to hell. Climate change is making the planet uninhabitable, terror groups roam swathes of the Earth virulent and unchecked, and political opportunists publish lies that weaponize the stupid. Any level-headed reading of recent news will surely convince you things are hopeless. So, why read news at all?

Unfortunately, not reading the news comes with its own risks. If you don't know what's going on, things can, well, catch you by surprise. You can catch COVID if you didn't know about prevention, or can be thought a fool if you can't carry a literate conversation at an after-work party.

So what's the solution? How can you be informed without being hopeless? How can you carry a literate conversation without making yourself miserable?
Here's how:
 develop a list of literate-sounding things to say, memorize, and deploy them. That's how most people sound intelligent at parties after all. Practice saying things like: ""I've never heard that put so well before,"" ""Yes, we live in interesting times, don't we,"" and ""That's just so interesting,"" to name just three.

You can seem to be in the know, when in reality you haven't looked at the news in decades. I mean, you'll be dead in the end anyway, and reading the news won't change that. So why not hit the retirement years worry free — or as worry free as possible anyway.
If you choose that route remember: always answer in the affirmative, it is the path of least resistance.
 It's much easier to say ""yes"" than to offer a dissenting opinion.

 It's much easier to say ""yes"" than to offer a dissenting opinion.

Just watch people gravitate toward you, admiring smiles on their lips. You will come off as worldly, intelligent, and in control of your own destiny.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Sure: it makes you depressed and hopeless. Let's face it, the world is going straight to hell. Climate change is making the planet uninhabitable, terror groups roam swathes of the Earth virulent and unchecked, and political opportunists publish lies that weaponize the stupid. Any level-headed reading of recent news will surely convince you things are hopeless. So, why read news at all?

Unfortunately, not reading the news comes with its own risks. If you don't know what's going on, things can, well, catch you by surprise. You can catch COVID if you didn't know about prevention, or can be thought a fool if you can't carry a literate conversation at an after-work party.

So what's the solution? How can you be informed without being hopeless? How can you carry a literate conversation without making yourself miserable?
Here's how:
 develop a list of literate-sounding things to say, memorize, and deploy them. That's how most people sound intelligent at parties after all. Practice saying things like: ""I've never heard that put so well before,"" ""Yes, we live in interesting times, don't we,"" and ""That's just so interesting,"" to name just three.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Sure: it makes you depressed and hopeless. Let's face it, the world is going straight to hell. Climate change is making the planet uninhabitable, terror groups roam swathes of the Earth virulent and unchecked, and political opportunists publish lies that weaponize the stupid. Any level-headed reading of recent news will surely convince you things are hopeless. So, why read news at all?

Unfortunately, not reading the news comes with its own risks. If you don't know what's going on, things can, well, catch you by surprise. You can catch COVID if you didn't know about prevention, or can be thought a fool if you can't carry a literate conversation at an after-work party.

So what's the solution? How can you be informed without being hopeless? How can you carry a literate conversation without making yourself miserable?
Here's how:
 develop a list of literate-sounding things to say, memorize, and deploy them. That's how most people sound intelligent at parties after all. Practice saying things like: ""I've never heard that put so well before,"" ""Yes, we live in interesting times, don't we,"" and ""That's just so interesting,"" to name just three.

You can seem to be in the know, when in reality you haven't looked at the news in decades. I mean, you'll be dead in the end anyway, and reading the news won't change that. So why not hit the retirement years worry free — or as worry free as possible anyway.
If you choose that route remember: always answer in the affirmative, it is the path of least resistance.
 It's much easier to say ""yes"" than to offer a dissenting opinion.

Just watch people gravitate toward you, admiring smiles on their lips. You will come off as worldly, intelligent, and in control of your own destiny.

Climate change is making the planet uninhabitable, terror groups roam swathes of the Earth virulent and unchecked, and political opportunists publish lies that weaponize the stupid. Any level-headed reading of recent news will surely convince you things are hopeless. So, why read news at all?

Unfortunately, not reading the news comes with its own risks. If you don't know what's going on, things can, well, catch you by surprise. You can catch COVID if you didn't know about prevention, or can be thought a fool if you can't carry a literate conversation at an after-work party.

So what's the solution? How can you be informed without being hopeless? How can you carry a literate conversation without making yourself miserable?
Here's how:
 develop a list of literate-sounding things to say, memorize, and deploy them. That's how most people sound intelligent at parties after all. Practice saying things like: ""I've never heard that put so well before,"" ""Yes, we live in interesting times, don't we,"" and ""That's just so interesting,"" to name just three.

You can seem to be in the know, when in reality you haven't looked at the news in decades. I mean, you'll be dead in the end anyway, and reading the news won't change that. So why not hit the retirement years worry free — or as worry free as possible anyway.
If you choose that route remember: always answer in the affirmative, it is the path of least resistance.
 It's much easier to say ""yes"" than to offer a dissenting opinion.

Just watch people gravitate toward you, admiring smiles on their lips. You will come off as worldly, intelligent, and in control of your own destiny.

Unfortunately, not reading the news comes with its own risks. If you don't know what's going on, things can, well, catch you by surprise. You can catch COVID if you didn't know about prevention, or can be thought a fool if you can't carry a literate conversation at an after-work party.

So what's the solution? How can you be informed without being hopeless? How can you carry a literate conversation without making yourself miserable?
Here's how:
 develop a list of literate-sounding things to say, memorize, and deploy them. That's how most people sound intelligent at parties after all. Practice saying things like: ""I've never heard that put so well before,"" ""Yes, we live in interesting times, don't we,"" and ""That's just so interesting,"" to name just three.

You can seem to be in the know, when in reality you haven't looked at the news in decades. I mean, you'll be dead in the end anyway, and reading the news won't change that. So why not hit the retirement years worry free — or as worry free as possible anyway.
If you choose that route remember: always answer in the affirmative, it is the path of least resistance.
 It's much easier to say ""yes"" than to offer a dissenting opinion.

Just watch people gravitate toward you, admiring smiles on their lips. You will come off as worldly, intelligent, and in control of your own destiny. 

And if you really want to hear yourself talk, consider running for office. MOst politicians are already following this simple plan.",user,29,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
