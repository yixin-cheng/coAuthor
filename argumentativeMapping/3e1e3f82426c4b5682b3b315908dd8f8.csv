They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home.

She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely.

This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

This brings to mind a third stereotype, which comes in a package with the previous two - the ""bad dad."" In this case, the father is merely well meaning but incompetent, but often , he's just plain bad. He's either a drunk, or a gambler, or a womanizer, or all of the above. His parenting skills are nonexistent, and he's usually a complete moron to boot. If he's married, his wife d",user,14,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

This brings to mind a third stereotype, which comes in a package with the previous two - the ""bad dad."" In this case, the father is merely well meaning but incompetent, but often , he's just plain bad. He's either a drunk, or a gambler, or a womanizer, or all of the above.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

This brings to mind a third stereotype, which comes in a package with the previous two - the ""bad dad."" In this case, the father is merely well meaning but incompetent, but often , he's just plain bad. He's either a drunk, or a gambler, or a womanizer, or all of the above. His parenting skills are nonexistent, and he's usually a complete moron to boot. If he's married, his wife divorces him. If he remarries, his new wife is eith",user,15,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

This brings to mind a third stereotype, which comes in a package with the previous two - the ""bad dad."" In this case, the father is merely well meaning but incompetent, but often , he's just plain bad. He's either a drunk, or a gambler, or a womanizer, or all of the above. His parenting skills are nonexistent, and he's usually a complete moron to boot. If he's married, his wife divorces him.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

This brings to mind a third stereotype, which comes in a package with the previous two - the ""bad dad."" In this case, the father is merely well meaning but incompetent, but often , he's just plain bad. He's either a drunk, or a gambler, or a womanizer, or all of the above. His parenting skills are nonexistent, and he's usually a complete moron to boot. If he's married, his wife divorces him. If he remarries, his new wife is either a saint forced to vainly attempt to reform him, or a monster who is cruel to his children.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

This brings to mind a third stereotype, which comes in a package with the previous two - the ""bad dad.""

His parenting skills are nonexistent, and he's usually a complete moron to boot. If he's married, his wife divorces him.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

This brings to mind a third stereotype, which comes in a package with the previous two - the ""bad dad."" In this case, the father is merely well meaning but incompetent, but often , he's just plain bad. He's either a drunk, or a gambler, or a womanizer, or all of the above. His parenting skills are nonexistent, and he's usually a complete moron to boot. If he's married, his wife divorces him. If he remarries, his new wife is either a saint forced to vainly attempt to reform him, or a monster who is cruel to his children. In no event does he ever fix all the problems he's caused, this is always left to his wife or children.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

This brings to mind a third stereotype, which comes in a package with the previous two - the ""bad dad."" In this case, the father is merely well meaning but incompetent, but often , he's just plain bad. He's either a drunk, or a gambler, or a womanizer, or all of the above. His parenting skills are nonexistent, and he's usually a complete moron to boot. If he's married, his wife divorces him. If he remarries, his new wife is either a saint forced to vainly attempt to reform him, or a monster who is cruel to his children. In no event does he ever fix all the problems he's caused, this is always left to his wife or children.

This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

This brings to mind a third stereotype, which comes in a package with the previous two - the ""bad dad."" In this case, the father is merely well meaning but incompetent, but often , he's just plain bad. He's either a drunk, or a gambler, or a womanizer, or all of the above. His parenting skills are nonexistent, and he's usually a complete moron to boot. If he's married, his wife divorces him. If he remarries, his new wife is either a saint forced to vainly attempt to reform him, or a monster who is cruel to his children. In no event does he ever fix all the problems he's caused, this is always left to his wife or children.

She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

This brings to mind a third stereotype, which comes in a package with the previous two - the ""bad dad."" In this case, the father is merely well meaning but incompetent, but often , he's just plain bad. He's either a drunk, or a gambler, or a womanizer, or all of the above. His parenting skills are nonexistent, and he's usually a complete moron to boot. If he's married, his wife divorces him. If he remarries, his new wife is either a saint forced to vainly attempt to reform him, or a monster who is cruel to his children. In no event does he ever fix all the problems he's caused, this is always left to his wife or children.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

This brings to mind a third stereotype, which comes in a package with the previous two - the ""bad dad."" In this case, the father is merely well meaning but incompetent, but often , he's just plain bad. He's either a drunk, or a gambler, or a womanizer, or all of the above. His parenting skills are nonexistent, and he's usually a complete moron to boot. If he's married, his wife divorces him. If he remarries, his new wife is either a saint forced to vainly attempt to reform him, or a monster who is cruel to his children. In no event does he ever fix all the problems he's caused, this is always left to his wife or children.

This brings to mind a third stereotype, which comes in a package with the previous two - the ""bad dad."" In this case, the father is merely well meaning but incompetent, but often , he's just plain bad. He's either a drunk, or a gambler, or a womanizer, or all of the above. His parenting skills are nonexistent, and he's usually a complete moron to boot. If he's married, his wife divorces him. If he remarries, his new wife is either a saint forced to vainly attempt to reform him, or a monster who is cruel to his children. In no event does he ever fix all the problems he's caused, this is always left to his wife or children.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

This brings to mind a third stereotype, which comes in a package with the previous two - the ""bad dad."" In this case, the father is merely well meaning but incompetent, but often , he's just plain bad. He's either a drunk, or a gambler, or a womanizer, or all of the above. His parenting skills are nonexistent, and he's usually a complete moron to boot. If he's married, his wife divorces him. If he remarries, his new wife is either a saint forced to vainly attempt to reform him, or a monster who is cruel to his children. In no event does he ever fix all the problems he's caused, this is always left to his wife or children.

She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

His parenting skills are nonexistent, and he's usually a complete moron to boot. If he's married, his wife divorces him. If he remarries, his new wife is either a saint forced to vainly attempt to reform him, or a monster who is cruel to his children.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

This brings to mind a third stereotype, which comes in a package with the previous two - the ""bad dad."" In this case, the father is merely well meaning but incompetent, but often , he's just plain bad. He's either a drunk, or a gambler, or a womanizer, or all of the above. His parenting skills are nonexistent, and he's usually a complete moron to boot. If he's married, his wife divorces him. If he remarries, his new wife is either a saint forced to vainly attempt to reform him, or a monster who is cruel to his children. In no event does he ever fix all the problems he's caused, this is always left to his wife or children.

This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

This brings to mind a third stereotype, which comes in a package with the previous two - the ""bad dad."" In this case, the father is merely well meaning but incompetent, but often , he's just plain bad. He's either a drunk, or a gambler, or a womanizer, or all of the above. His parenting skills are nonexistent, and he's usually a complete moron to boot. If he's married, his wife divorces him. If he remarries, his new wife is either a saint forced to vainly attempt to reform him, or a monster who is cruel to his children. In no event does he ever fix all the problems he's caused, this is always left to his wife or children.

There are many other stereotyical characters I could mention, but I'd say the above three are some of the most noxious, because they are so common, and so often used, and usually occur in a package. An individual stereotyped character in a story can be tolerated",user,18,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

This brings to mind a third stereotype, which comes in a package with the previous two - the ""bad dad."" In this case, the father is merely well meaning but incompetent, but often , he's just plain bad. He's either a drunk, or a gambler, or a womanizer, or all of the above. His parenting skills are nonexistent, and he's usually a complete moron to boot. If he's married, his wife divorces him. If he remarries, his new wife is either a saint forced to vainly attempt to reform him, or a monster who is cruel to his children.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are.

This brings to mind a third stereotype, which comes in a package with the previous two - the ""bad dad."" In this case, the father is merely well meaning but incompetent, but often , he's just plain bad. He's either a drunk, or a gambler, or a womanizer, or all of the above. His parenting skills are nonexistent, and he's usually a complete moron to boot. If he's married, his wife divorces him. If he remarries, his new wife is either a saint forced to vainly attempt to reform him, or a monster who is cruel to his children. In no event does he ever fix all the problems he's caused, this is always left to his wife or children.

There are many other stereotyical characters I could mention, but I'd say the above three are some of the most noxious, because they are so common, and so often used, and usually occur in a package.

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely.

She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

This brings to mind a third stereotype, which comes in a package with the previous two - the ""bad dad."" In this case, the father is merely well meaning but incompetent, but often , he's just plain bad. He's either a drunk, or a gambler, or a womanizer, or all of the above. His parenting skills are nonexistent, and he's usually a complete moron to boot. If he's married, his wife divorces him. If he remarries, his new wife is either a saint forced to vainly attempt to reform him, or a monster who is cruel to his children. In no event does he ever fix all the problems he's caused, this is always left to his wife or children.

There are many other stereotyical characters I could mention, but I'd say the above three are some of the most noxious, because they are so common, and so often used, and usually occur in a package.

In this case, the father is merely well meaning but incompetent, but often , he's just plain bad. He's either a drunk, or a gambler, or a womanizer, or all of the above. His parenting skills are nonexistent, and he's usually a complete moron to boot. If he's married, his wife divorces him. If he remarries, his new wife is either a saint forced to vainly attempt to reform him, or a monster who is cruel to his children. In no event does he ever fix all the problems he's caused, this is always left to his wife or children.

There are many other stereotyical characters I could mention, but I'd say the above three are some of the most noxious, because they are so common, and so often used, and usually occur in a package. An individual stereotyped character in a story can be tolerated, or forgiven, but it is the combination of all three that makes me cringe.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.
