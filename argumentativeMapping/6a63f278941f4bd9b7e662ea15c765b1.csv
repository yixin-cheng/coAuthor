In my opinion, dating apps and technology has ruined dating. It used to be that you found a mate in person at a local establishment, work or at a friend's house, now people are looked at as data and not real people.
 have been on a few dating apps and it's just not the same as meeting someone in person.
 It made sense to me at first, all the algorithms figuring out who is best for you but what they dont do is put you next to the person right away so your biochemistry can help signal you one way or another. Pheromones and other biological signals that the body and mind silently sends out and picks up on is essential at finding a suitable, compatible mate.  think people are missing out on the real thing,aand it might be that dating mostly becomes a digital interaction using one of several devices. They they will soon mostly meet up in virtual reality, totally bypassing the full physical experience. I think that dating apps are a great way to meet people, but I don't think that they should be used as athe only way of interacting with them. People need to meet, they need to interact in person and need to exchange all the information that comes with being next to a real person. There should be an option on the dating apps that tell a potential match that they must meet in person soon after they agree that they are possibly compatible. So in my mind, the old fashioned way is still the best but using dating sites for the initial meeting is understandable but physically being with a person on a date is far superior to just having interactions over the internet.
