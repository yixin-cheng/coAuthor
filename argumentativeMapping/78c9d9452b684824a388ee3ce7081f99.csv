In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, not keeping up with the news is not bad. Some people dont have the time or interest. They prefer to focus on different things and that is just fine as long as they dont try to influence the system with unsupported claims. aving some basic grasp of what is going on is quite useful. but not necessary to becoming a ""good"", productive, law abiding citizen. It was not until the 90's that we had access to so much information. People got along okay before then.  Some people may just be burnt out from information overload that they check out and dont pay attention anymore and I can not blame those people. Its one thing to keep up with current events, its another to compulsorily consume it. I'm sure there are plenty of people who get along just fine without keeping up with current events. They maybe doing better then some of us psychologically who do keep up with the news on a daily basis. Some news outlets are just more about keeping our attention then giving us things of substance. There are so many confilicting views, I can see how people would tune out. So I say no to being a bad person if you do not keep up with the news.
