In my opinion, there is a specific stereotype that bugs me. It's the idea that all people who are overweight are lazy and eat junk food all day.

In my opinion, there is a specific stereotype that bugs me. It's the idea that all people who are overweight are lazy and eat junk food all day. Although society has gotten better and you see it less, there is still plenty of this type of stereotype portrayed in TV and film.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there is a specific stereotype that bugs me. It's the idea that all people who are overweight are lazy and eat junk food all day. Although society has gotten better and you see it less, there is still plenty of this type of stereotype portrayed in TV and film. Often times in movies you see that the person who is greedy or just plain lazy is portrayed by an overweight person. Most of the time, this is not true at all. In real life, plenty of people who are both lazy AND greedy are often beautiful and healthy looking. That message perpetuates a misleading image about something that is far from healthy. In addition to that the overweight person stereotype is usually given horrible lines to say and laughs at themselves and their predicament. It is common to see less character development over all with overweight stereotype characters. This gives a damaging view of things to society as though a person who is overweight isn't capable of change or is somehow less than human.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there is a specific stereotype that bugs me. It's the idea that all people who are overweight are lazy and eat junk food all day. Although society has gotten better and you see it less, there is still plenty of this type of stereotype portrayed in TV and film. Often times in movies you see that the person who is greedy or just plain lazy is portrayed by an overweight person. Most of the time, this is not true at all. In real life, plenty of people who are both lazy AND greedy are often beautiful and healthy looking. That message perpetuates a misleading image about something that is far from healthy. In addition to that the overweight person stereotype is usually given horrible lines to say and laughs at themselves and their predicament. It is common to see less character development over all with overweight stereotype characters. This gives a damaging view of things to society as though a person who is overweight isn't capable of change or is somehow less than human. 

Another reason this type of stereotype makes me cringe is simply because I'm a caring human being and I personally know people who have suffered emotionally because of being over weight. I know they often are harder on themselves because of this type of stereotype. Watching movies and film should be a way to escape and enjoy some downtime.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there is a specific stereotype that bugs me. It's the idea that all people who are overweight are lazy and eat junk food all day. Although society has gotten better and you see it less, there is still plenty of this type of stereotype portrayed in TV and film. Often times in movies you see that the person who is greedy or just plain lazy is portrayed by an overweight person. Most of the time, this is not true at all. In real life, plenty of people who are both lazy AND greedy are often beautiful and healthy looking. That message perpetuates a misleading image about something that is far from healthy. In addition to that the overweight person stereotype is usually given horrible lines to say and laughs at themselves and their predicament. It is common to see less character development over all with overweight stereotype characters. This gives a damaging view of things to society as though a person who is overweight isn't capable of change or is somehow less than human. 

Another reason this type of stereotype makes me cringe is simply because I'm a caring human being and I personally know people who have suffered emotionally because of being over weight. I know they often are harder on themselves because of this type of stereotype. Watching movies and film should be a way to escape and enjoy some downtime.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there is a specific stereotype that bugs me. It's the idea that all people who are overweight are lazy and eat junk food all day. Although society has gotten better and you see it less, there is still plenty of this type of stereotype portrayed in TV and film. Often times in movies you see that the person who is greedy or just plain lazy is portrayed by an overweight person. Most of the time, this is not true at all. In real life, plenty of people who are both lazy AND greedy are often beautiful and healthy looking. That message perpetuates a misleading image about something that is far from healthy. In addition to that the overweight person stereotype is usually given horrible lines to say and laughs at themselves and their predicament.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there is a specific stereotype that bugs me. It's the idea that all people who are overweight are lazy and eat junk food all day. Although society has gotten better and you see it less, there is still plenty of this type of stereotype portrayed in TV and film. Often times in movies you see that the person who is greedy or just plain lazy is portrayed by an overweight person. Most of the time, this is not true at all. In real life, plenty of people who are both lazy AND greedy are often beautiful and healthy looking. That message perpetuates a misleading image about something that is far from healthy. In addition to that the overweight person stereotype is usually given horrible lines to say and laughs at themselves and their predicament. It is common to see less character development over all with overweight stereotype characters. This gives a damaging view of things to society as though a person who is overweight isn't capable of change or is somehow less than human.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there is a specific stereotype that bugs me. It's the idea that all people who are overweight are lazy and eat junk food all day. Although society has gotten better and you see it less, there is still plenty of this type of stereotype portrayed in TV and film. Often times in movies you see that the person who is greedy or just plain lazy is portrayed by an overweight person. Most of the time, this is not true at all. In real life, plenty of people who are both lazy AND greedy are often beautiful and healthy looking. That message perpetuates a misleading image about something that is far from healthy. In addition to that the overweight person stereotype is usually given horrible lines to say and laughs at themselves and their predicament. It is common to see less character development over all with overweight stereotype characters. This gives a damaging view of things to society as though a person who is overweight isn't capable of change or is somehow less than human. 

Another reason this type of stereotype makes me cringe is simply because I'm a caring human being and I personally know people who have suffered emotionally because of being over weight.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there is a specific stereotype that bugs me. It's the idea that all people who are overweight are lazy and eat junk food all day. Although society has gotten better and you see it less, there is still plenty of this type of stereotype portrayed in TV and film. Often times in movies you see that the person who is greedy or just plain lazy is portrayed by an overweight person. Most of the time, this is not true at all. In real life, plenty of people who are both lazy AND greedy are often beautiful and healthy looking. That message perpetuates a misleading image about something that is far from healthy. In addition to that the overweight person stereotype is usually given horrible lines to say and laughs at themselves and their predicament. It is common to see less character development over all with overweight stereotype characters. This gives a damaging view of things to society as though a person who is overweight isn't capable of change or is somehow less than human. 

Another reason this type of stereotype makes me cringe is simply because I'm a caring human being and I personally know people who have suffered emotionally because of being over weight. I know they often are harder on themselves because of this type of stereotype. Watching movies and film should be a way to escape and enjoy some downtime.
