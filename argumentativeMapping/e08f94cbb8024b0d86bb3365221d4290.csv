In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body a",user,24,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that",user,25,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds",user,27,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you",user,28,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or in",user,28,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That'",user,29,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they wou",user,29,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life",user,31,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect",user,32,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others. 

School is such a valuable place. You learn essential things, you meet essential people and you grow and mature as a",user,34,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others. 

School is such a valuable place. You learn essential things, you meet essential people and you grow and mature over time. School is imp",user,35,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others. 

School is such a valuable place. You learn essential things, you meet essential people and you grow and mature over time. School is important, so if you are a student, make sure that yo",user,35,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others. 

School is such a valuable place. You learn essential things, you meet essential people and you grow and mature over time. School is important, so if you are a student, make sure that you take it seriou",user,35,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others. 

School is such a valuable place. You learn essential things, you meet essential people and you grow and mature over time. School is important, so if you are a student, make sure that you take it seriously and enjoy it",user,35,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job.

Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others. 

School is such a valuable place. You learn essential things, you meet essential people and you grow and mature over time. School is important, so if you are a student, make sure that you take it seriously and enjoy it because it's done before you kn",user,35,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.
