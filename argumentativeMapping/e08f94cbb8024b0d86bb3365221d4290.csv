In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that",user,19,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English lang",user,21,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. Whe",user,27,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects.

I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or",user,27,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because t",user,28,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's im",user,30,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in",user,30,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect",user,31,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for",user,31,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so.

We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others. 

School is such a valuable place. You learn essential things, you meet essential people and you grow and mature over time. School ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others. 

School is such a valuable place. You learn essential things, you meet essential people and you grow and mature over time. School is important, so if you are",user,34,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others. 

School is such a valuable place. You learn essential things, you meet essential people and you grow and mature over time. School is important, so if you are a student, m",user,34,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented.
