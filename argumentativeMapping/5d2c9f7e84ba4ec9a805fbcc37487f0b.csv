In my opinion, there is one stereotype I see often in movies and television shows that bugs me and that is the dumb blonde female character. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a movie or show where a female character is blonde and is portrayed as being dumb. It's as though if someone is blonde they would be more likely to behave that way. This is not true, nor have I even seen any evidence of that being reality. 'm not sure why this stereotype is so prevalent in movies and television shows, but it is.
 There is always something that comes off as sexist about that character too. She's typically attractive and wearing suggestive clothing. It's as though the writers of these shows and movies think that women are stupid and that they need to be portrayed as such. If not, then they just think that others will find it funny. Either way I don't understand and I don't relate. And it is demeaning to portray women in this way.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I see often in movies and television shows that bugs me and that is the dumb blonde female character. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a movie or show where a female character is blonde and is portrayed as being dumb. It's as though if someone is blonde they would be more likely to behave that way. This is not true, nor have I even seen any evidence of that being reality. 'm not sure why this stereotype is so prevalent in movies and television shows, but it is.
 There is always something that comes off as sexist about that character too. She's typically attractive and wearing suggestive clothing. It's as though the writers of these shows and movies think that women are stupid and that they need to be portrayed as such. If not, then they just think that others will find it funny. Either way I don't understand and I don't relate. And it is demeaning to portray women in this way.

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I see often in movies and television shows that bugs me and that is the dumb blonde female character. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a movie or show where a female character is blonde and is portrayed as being dumb. It's as though if someone is blonde they would be more likely to behave that way. This is not true, nor have I even seen any evidence of that being reality. 'm not sure why this stereotype is so prevalent in movies and television shows, but it is.
 There is always something that comes off as sexist about that character too. She's typically attractive and wearing suggestive clothing. She is usually talking repetitiv It's as though the writers of these shows and movies think that women are stupid and that they need to be portrayed as such. If not, then they just think that others will find it funny. Either way I don't understand and I don't relate. And it is demeaning to portray women in this way.
Another thing about this stereotype that absolutely makes me cringe is that it is so overused. Even if it were funny (which it isn't), nothing has much entertainment value when it's so overused that it lacks any originality. It's hard to take it seriously. ",user,10,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I see often in movies and television shows that bugs me and that is the dumb blonde female character. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a movie or show where a female character is blonde and is portrayed as being dumb. It's as though if someone is blonde they would be more likely to behave that way. This is not true, nor have I even seen any evidence of that being reality. 'm not sure why this stereotype is so prevalent in movies and television shows, but it is.
 There is always something that comes off as sexist about that character too. She's typically attractive and wearing suggestive clothing. She is usually talking repetitively, while making each sentence sound It's as though the writers of these shows and movies think that women are stupid and that they need to be portrayed as such. If not, then they just think that others will find it funny. Either way I don't understand and I don't relate. And it is demeaning to portray women in this way.

It's as though the writers of these shows and movies think that women are stupid and that they need to be portrayed as such. If not, then they just think that others will find it funny. Either way I don't understand and I don't relate. And it is demeaning to portray women in this way.
Another thing about this stereotype that absolutely makes me cringe is that it is so overused. Even if it were funny (which it isn't), nothing has much entertainment value when it's so overused that it lacks any originality. It's hard to take it seriously.

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I see often in movies and television shows that bugs me and that is the dumb blonde female character. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a movie or show where a female character is blonde and is portrayed as being dumb. It's as though if someone is blonde they would be more likely to behave that way. This is not true, nor have I even seen any evidence of that being reality. 'm not sure why this stereotype is so prevalent in movies and television shows, but it is.

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I see often in movies and television shows that bugs me and that is the dumb blonde female character. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a movie or show where a female character is blonde and is portrayed as being dumb. It's as though if someone is blonde they would be more likely to behave that way. This is not true, nor have I even seen any evidence of that being reality. 'm not sure why this stereotype is so prevalent in movies and television shows, but it is.
 There is always something that comes off as sexist about that character too. She's typically attractive and wearing suggestive clothing. She is usually talking repetitively, while making each statement end with the tone of a question. It's as though the writers of these shows and movies think that women are stupid and that they need to be portrayed as such. If not, then they just think that others will find it funny. Either way I don't understand and I don't relate. And it is demeaning to portray women in this way.
Another thing about this stereotype that absolutely makes me cringe is that it is so overused. Even if it were funny (which it isn't), nothing has much entertainment value when it's so overused that it lacks any originality. It's hard to take it seriously.

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I see often in movies and television shows that bugs me and that is the dumb blonde female character. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a movie or show where a female character is blonde and is portrayed as being dumb. It's as though if someone is blonde they would be more likely to behave that way. This is not true, nor have I even seen any evidence of that being reality. 'm not sure why this stereotype is so prevalent in movies and television shows, but it is.
 There is always something that comes off as sexist about that character too. She's typically attractive and wearing suggestive clothing. She is usually talking repetitively, while making each statement end with the tone of a question. It's as though the writers of these shows and movies think that women are stupid and that they need to be portrayed as such. If not, then they just think that others will find it funny. Either way I don't understand and I don't relate. And it is demeaning to portray women in this way.
Another thing about this stereotype that absolutely makes me cringe is that it is so overused. Even if it were funny (which it isn't), nothing has much entertainment value when it's so overused that it lacks any originality. It's hard to take it seriously.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I see often in movies and television shows that bugs me and that is the dumb blonde female character. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a movie or show where a female character is blonde and is portrayed as being dumb. It's as though if someone is blonde they would be more likely to behave that way. This is not true, nor have I even seen any evidence of that being reality. 'm not sure why this stereotype is so prevalent in movies and television shows, but it is.
 There is always something that comes off as sexist about that character too. She's typically attractive and wearing suggestive clothing. She is usually talking repetitively, while making each statement end with the tone of a question. It's as though the writers of these shows and movies think that women are stupid and that they need to be portrayed as such. If not, then they just think that others will find it funny. Either way I don't understand and I don't relate. And it is demeaning to portray women in this way.
Another thing about this stereotype that absolutely makes me cringe is that it is so overused. Even if it were funny (which it isn't), nothing has much entertainment value when it's so overused that it lacks any originality. It's hard to take it seriously.
