In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues. While the players doing sports in school, at the same time, will have a chance to really excel in whatever they do.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues. While the players doing sports in school, at the same time, will have a chance to really excel in whatever they do. All, or most, of their motivation would come from the prospect of being able to do something in college that they love and get paid for it at the same time.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues. While the players doing sports in school, at the same time, will have a chance to really excel in whatever they do. All, or most, of their motivation would come from the prospect of being able to do something in college that they love and get paid for it at the same time.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues. While the players doing sports in school, at the same time, will have a chance to really excel in whatever they do.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues. While the players doing sports in school, at the same time, will have a chance to really excel in whatever they do. All, or most, of their motivation would come from the prospect of being able to do something in college that they love and get paid for it at the same time.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues. While the players doing sports in school, at the same time, will have a chance to really excel in whatever they do. All, or most, of their motivation would come from the prospect of being able to do something in college that they love and get paid for it at the same time.
