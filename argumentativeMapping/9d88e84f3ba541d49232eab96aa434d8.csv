I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues. While the players doing sports in school, at the same time, will have a chance to really excel in whatever they do. All, or most, of their motivation would come from the prospect of being able to do something in college that they love and get paid for it at the same time.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues. While the players doing sports in school, at the same time, will have a chance to really excel in whatever they do.

I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues. While the players doing sports in school, at the same time, will have a chance to really excel in whatever they do.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues. While the players doing sports in school, at the same time, will have a chance to really excel in whatever they do.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues. While the players doing sports in school, at the same time, will have a chance to really excel in whatever they do.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues. While the players doing sports in school, at the same time, will have a chance to really excel in whatever they do. All, or most, of their motivation would come from the prospect of being able to do something in college that they love and get paid for it at the same time.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues. While the players doing sports in school, at the same time, will have a chance to really excel in whatever they do.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues. While the players doing sports in school, at the same time, will have a chance to really excel in whatever they do.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues. While the players doing sports in school, at the same time, will have a chance to really excel in whatever they do.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues.

I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues. While the players doing sports in school, at the same time, will have a chance to really excel in whatever they do. All, or most, of their motivation would come from the prospect of being able to do something in college that they love and get paid for it at the same time. All while majoring in another few subjects. 

The colleges make tons of money from these players, so I do not find the argument that they should not be paid feasible even in the slightest. Did I also mention that it would help bring more ""minorities""  into college for a chance to achieve their dreams and leave them in a better place for their life.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues. While the players doing sports in school, at the same time, will have a chance to really excel in whatever they do. All, or most, of their motivation would come from the prospect of being able to do something in college that they love and get paid for it at the same time.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues. While the players doing sports in school, at the same time, will have a chance to really excel in whatever they do. All, or most, of their motivation would come from the prospect of being able to do something in college that they love and get paid for it at the same time. All while majoring in another few subjects. 

The colleges make tons of money from these players, so I do not find the argument that they should not be paid feasible even in the slightest.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues. While the players doing sports in school, at the same time, will have a chance to really excel in whatever they do. All, or most, of their motivation would come from the prospect of being able to do something in college that they love and get paid for it at the same time. All while majoring in another few subjects. 

The colleges make tons of money from these players, so I do not find the argument that they should not be paid feasible even in the slightest.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues.

From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues. While the players doing sports in school, at the same time, will have a chance to really excel in whatever they do. All, or most, of their motivation would come from the prospect of being able to do something in college that they love and get paid for it at the same time. All while majoring in another few subjects. 

The colleges make tons of money from these players, so I do not find the argument that they should not be paid feasible even in the slightest. Did I also mention that it would help bring more ""minorities""  into college for a chance to achieve their dreams and leave them in a better place for their life. Parents would also be proud, and more inclined to encourage their children to try to get into college at the same time. ",user,18,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.
