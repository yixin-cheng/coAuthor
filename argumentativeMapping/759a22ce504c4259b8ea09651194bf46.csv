---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic.

I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic.

I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone?

If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way.

I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me.

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way.

But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits.

It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits.

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID.

I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID.

I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health.

I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them.

I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me.

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life.

 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult",user,28,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me.

I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and ch",user,28,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health.

But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way.

I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technolBut we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me.

If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eBut we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life.

Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strainBut we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also bBut we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID.

But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time iBut we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevBut we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad.

Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our choBut we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and wBut we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad.

Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assigBut we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments donBut we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks.

Than It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic.

But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world.

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life.

I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me.

But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit f It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits.

But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the a It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits.

But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline to It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits.

But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward futu It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits.

I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected.

Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I c It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me.

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled  It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend.

But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them.

I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them.

I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; howev It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic.

I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way.

But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. I My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. I aMy best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. I meanMy best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad.

Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. IMy best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected.

But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand.

Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, es. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world.

I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially . But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way.

Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because h. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because . But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected.

I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them.

I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue an. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she h. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told m. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected.

So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she ha. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world.

If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked . But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the b. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand.

 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the best caterer in al. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the best caterer in all of So. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad.

I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the best caterer in all of Southeast . But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them.

Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the best caterer in all of Southeast Asia. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the best caterer in all of Southeast Asia. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me.

If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the best caterer in all of Southeast Asia. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID.

Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the best caterer in all of Southeast Asia. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected.

If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the best caterer in all of Southeast Asia. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done.

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

1356,text-insert,"How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the best caterer in all of Southeast Asia. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me.
