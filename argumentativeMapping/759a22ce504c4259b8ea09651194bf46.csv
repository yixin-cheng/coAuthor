The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way.

I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life.

It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way.

My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally",user,25,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way.

My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way.

I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me.

Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected.

It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way.

 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone?

I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand.

It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and ",user,27,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health.

It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID.

I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficul",user,29,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and cahell",user,29,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and cha",user,29,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them.

But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging ti",user,29,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using tBut we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life.

Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cBut we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life.

Using technology can cause eye But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, anBut we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way.

Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if iBut we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID.

If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone?

I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting oBut we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks.

I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world.

Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

text-insert,"How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignmenBut we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfu It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way.

I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to  It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic.

I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world.

My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life.

But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airlin It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them.

I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life.

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future tr It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me.

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

text-insert,"How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me.

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancel It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me.

I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my tr It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand.

But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

text-insert,"How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plan It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand.

I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

text-insert,"How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; ho It's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them.

Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, t's been really tough for me and no doubt for them as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

text-insert,"How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world.

My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my fami as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

text-insert,"How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone?

 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. I also My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks.

But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. I My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. I meaMy best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding,. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad.

I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

text-insert,"How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especial. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way.

But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand.

Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because her . But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world.

I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she h. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way.

Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blow. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she . But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits.

But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand.

My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic.

Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had book. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the ba. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad.

But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the best ca.

I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the best caterer in. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the best caterer in all of. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the best caterer in all of Southeas. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me.

My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the best caterer in all of Southeast Asia. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

text-insert,"How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic.

text-insert,"How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the best caterer in all of Southeast Asia. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the best caterer in all of Southeast Asia. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

text-insert,"How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the best caterer in all of Southeast Asia. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the best caterer in all of Southeast Asia. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

text-insert,"How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the best caterer in all of Southeast Asia. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the best caterer in all of Southeast Asia. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time. 
BIn summary, I think smart words to live by are to e Safe and Stay Connected!
