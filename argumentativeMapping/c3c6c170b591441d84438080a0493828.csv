In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans.

Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college?

They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on/",user,27,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on?

Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on?

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on?

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on?

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on?

They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. Th",user,30,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on?

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases.

They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on?

They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases.

They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases.

They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases.

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues you can bring with this. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases. 

Athletes already have every advantage given to them. Lets choose not to ruin the foundations of college just to give them even more power. We have to think of everyone, es",user,33,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans.

Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on?

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues pa The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money  even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases. 

Athletes already have every advantage given to them. Lets choose not to ruin the foundations of college just to give them even more power. We have to think of everyone, especially the often forgotten artists of this world. ",user,11,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
