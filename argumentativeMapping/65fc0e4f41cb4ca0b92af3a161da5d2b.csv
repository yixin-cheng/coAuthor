Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood).

Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an offie ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood).

Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy.

If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry.

If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to",user,17,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy.

I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school.

Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage mapologize and make them happy.",user,18,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks apologize and make them happy.",user,18,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get toapologize and make them happy.",user,18,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table, apologize and make them happy.",user,18,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time.

Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant.

So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy.

For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time.

Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My b",user,21,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My bos sh",user,21,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school.

Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. A",user,22,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood).

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy.

This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patron",user,22,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood).

Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ev",user,24,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change c",user,24,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time.

Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am cer",user,24,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For thes",user,25,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience.

This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confi",user,25,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry.

These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry.

These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry.

So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job.

If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood).

This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know.

After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time.

This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers.

If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career.

For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood).

This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience.

This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly.

After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly.

Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? Nos",user,29,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers.

And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant.

I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess.

Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time.

I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers.

I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers.

After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world?

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school.

After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world?

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers.

Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time.

These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry.

So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry.

For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience.

I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school.

As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess.

Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant.

After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time.
