Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even th",user,16,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an offi",user,16,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood).

Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school.

Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school.

As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to managapologize and make them happy.",user,19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant.

I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other taskapologize and make them happy.",user,19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can getapologize and make them happy.",user,19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their tableapologize and make them happy.",user,19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0

If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time.

Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school.

If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. An",user,23,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy.

Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant.

Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant.

I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever cha",user,25,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school.

For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry.

Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers.

My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For",user,26,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reaso",user,26,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career.

This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly.

Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly.

Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly.

---

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly.

After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school.

Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience.

For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood).

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know.

If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant.

Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly.

After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? Nos",user,30,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers.

If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood).

These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy.

And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant.

And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world?

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy.

Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time.

For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood).

This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know.

My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant.

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy.
