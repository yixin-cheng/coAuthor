Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in theirmatch que",user,21,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match que to",user,21,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating. Duri",user,23,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating. During the recent and ongoing pandemic ap",user,23,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with.

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating. During the recent and ongoing pandemic apps and social media made it possible for people to continue to connect online. People suffered mentally and emotionally from not being able to socialize.

So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating. During the recent and ongoing pandemic apps and social media made it possible for people to continue to connect online. People suffered mentally and emotionally from not being able to socialize. Dating apps and such gave them a way to keep their interactions alive. It gave them a way to connect with people who were going through the same struggles.

So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating. During the recent and ongoing pandemic apps and social media made it possible for people to continue to connect online. People suffered mentally and emotionally from not being able to socialize.

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating. During the recent and ongoing pandemic apps and social media made it possible for people to continue to connect online. People suffered mentally and emotionally from not being able to socialize.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating. During the recent and ongoing pandemic apps and social media made it possible for people to continue to connect online. People suffered mentally and emotionally from not being able to socialize. Dating apps and such gave them a way to keep their interactions alive. It gave them a way to connect with people who were going through the same struggles.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating. During the recent and ongoing pandemic apps and social media made it possible for people to continue to connect online. People suffered mentally and emotionally from not being able to socialize. Dating apps and such gave them a way to keep their interactions alive. It gave them a way to connect with people who were going through the same struggles.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating. During the recent and ongoing pandemic apps and social media made it possible for people to continue to connect online. People suffered mentally and emotionally from not being able to socialize.

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time.

I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with.

During the recent and ongoing pandemic apps and social media made it possible for people to continue to connect online. People suffered mentally and emotionally from not being able to socialize.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating. During the recent and ongoing pandemic apps and social media made it possible for people to continue to connect online. People suffered mentally and emotionally from not being able to socialize. Dating apps and such gave them a way to keep their interactions alive. It gave them a way to connect with people who were going through the same struggles.

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating. During the recent and ongoing pandemic apps and social media made it possible for people to continue to connect online. People suffered mentally and emotionally from not being able to socialize. Dating apps and such gave them a way to keep their interactions alive. It gave them a way to connect with people who were going through the same struggles. Not just that but it gives a chance to people who normally wouldn't meet. Just because their social circles don't run with one another.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating. During the recent and ongoing pandemic apps and social media made it possible for people to continue to connect online. People suffered mentally and emotionally from not being able to socialize. Dating apps and such gave them a way to keep their interactions alive. It gave them a way to connect with people who were going through the same struggles. Not just that but it gives a chance to people who normally wouldn't meet. Just because their social circles don't run with one another.

For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating. During the recent and ongoing pandemic apps and social media made it possible for people to continue to connect online. People suffered mentally and emotionally from not being able to socialize. Dating apps and such gave them a way to keep their interactions alive. It gave them a way to connect with people who were going through the same struggles. Not just that but it gives a chance to people who normally wouldn't meet. Just because their social circles don't run with one another.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating. During the recent and ongoing pandemic apps and social media made it possible for people to continue to connect online. People suffered mentally and emotionally from not being able to socialize. Dating apps and such gave them a way to keep their interactions alive. It gave them a way to connect with people who were going through the same struggles.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating. During the recent and ongoing pandemic apps and social media made it possible for people to continue to connect online. People suffered mentally and emotionally from not being able to socialize. Dating apps and such gave them a way to keep their interactions alive. It gave them a way to connect with people who were going through the same struggles. Not just that but it gives a chance to people who normally wouldn't meet. Just because their social circles don't run with one another. 

So like all technology, there are pros to cons to both. It all falls on people to use them for good over nefa",user,30,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating. During the recent and ongoing pandemic apps and social media made it possible for people to continue to connect online. People suffered mentally and emotionally from not being able to socialize. Dating apps and such gave them a way to keep their interactions alive. It gave them a way to connect with people who were going through the same struggles.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating. During the recent and ongoing pandemic apps and social media made it possible for people to continue to connect online. People suffered mentally and emotionally from not being able to socialize. Dating apps and such gave them a way to keep their interactions alive. It gave them a way to connect with people who were going through the same struggles.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating. During the recent and ongoing pandemic apps and social media made it possible for people to continue to connect online. People suffered mentally and emotionally from not being able to socialize. Dating apps and such gave them a way to keep their interactions alive. It gave them a way to connect with people who were going through the same struggles. Not just that but it gives a chance to people who normally wouldn't meet. Just because their social circles don't run with one another. 

So like all technology, there are pros to cons to both. It all falls on people to use them for good over nefarious purposes.  Unforunately, people will alwa",user,31,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating. During the recent and ongoing pandemic apps and social media made it possible for people to continue to connect online. People suffered mentally and emotionally from not being able to socialize. Dating apps and such gave them a way to keep their interactions alive. It gave them a way to connect with people who were going through the same struggles. Not just that but it gives a chance to people who normally wouldn't meet. Just because their social circles don't run with one another.

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating. During the recent and ongoing pandemic apps and social media made it possible for people to continue to connect online. People suffered mentally and emotionally from not being able to socialize. Dating apps and such gave them a way to keep their interactions alive. It gave them a way to connect with people who were going through the same struggles. Not just that but it gives a chance to people who normally wouldn't meet. Just because their social circles don't run with one another.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating. During the recent and ongoing pandemic apps and social media made it possible for people to continue to connect online. People suffered mentally and emotionally from not being able to socialize. Dating apps and such gave them a way to keep their interactions alive. It gave them a way to connect with people who were going through the same struggles. Not just that but it gives a chance to people who normally wouldn't meet. Just because their social circles don't run with one another. 

So like all technology, there are pros to cons to both. It all falls on people to use them for good over nefarious purposes.  Unfortunately, humans will always be flawed.",user,31,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1
