Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. In fact, I think it is the right thing to do.   think that people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people because animals are innocent.; they do not have the ability to make choices, and they are not responsible for their actions. Humans, on the other hand, are responsible for their actions and have the ability to make choices.  So, an animal that is suffering cannot be responsible for its suffering, while a human who is suffering often is.
IThisibeing the case, t is tight thing tdo focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we have a moral obligation to help those
 who are innocent and cannot help themselves.  Humans are often responsible for their own suffering, and they have the ability to help themselves, or should. By focusing on animal welfare over that of humans, we are merely living up to a basic moral principle.  In fact, if we were to focus on the well-being of humans instead in this situation, we would be doing something wrong.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. In fact, I think it is the right thing to do.   think that people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people because animals are innocent.; they do not have the ability to make choices, and they are not responsible for their actions. Humans, on the other hand, are responsible for their actions and have the ability to make choices.  So, an animal that is suffering cannot be responsible for its suffering, while a human who is suffering often is.
IThisibeing the case, t is tight thing tdo focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we have a moral obligation to help those
 who are innocent and cannot help themselves.  Humans are often responsible for their own suffering, and they have the ability to help themselves, or should. By focusing on animal welfare over that of humans, we are merely living up to a basic moral principle.  In fact, if we were to focus on the well-being of humans instead in this situation, we would be doing something wrong.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. In fact, I think it is the right thing to do.   think that people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people because animals are innocent.; they do not have the ability to make choices, and they are not responsible for their actions. Humans, on the other hand, are responsible for their actions and have the ability to make choices.  So, an animal that is suffering cannot be responsible for its suffering, while a human who is suffering often is.
IThisibeing the case, t is tight thing tdo focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we have a moral obligation to help those
 who are innocent and cannot help themselves.  Humans are often responsible for their own suffering, and they have the ability to help themselves, or should. By focusing on animal welfare over that of humans, we are merely living up to a basic moral principle.  In fact, if we were to focus on the well-being of humans instead in this situation, we would be doing something wrong.

Besides, just because a person places the welfare of animals over that of humans, it does not mean that they do not care about humans. I'm pretty sure that the people who expend effort and money towards furthering animal welfare are the same people who would spend time and money helping humans.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. In fact, I think it is the right thing to do.   think that people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people because animals are innocent.; they do not have the ability to make choices, and they are not responsible for their actions. Humans, on the other hand, are responsible for their actions and have the ability to make choices.  So, an animal that is suffering cannot be responsible for its suffering, while a human who is suffering often is.

By focusing on animal welfare over that of humans, we are merely living up to a basic moral principle.  In fact, if we were to focus on the well-being of humans instead in this situation, we would be doing something wrong.

In fact, I think it is the right thing to do.   think that people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people because animals are innocent.; they do not have the ability to make choices, and they are not responsible for their actions.

So, an animal that is suffering cannot be responsible for its suffering, while a human who is suffering often is.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. In fact, I think it is the right thing to do.   think that people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people because animals are innocent.; they do not have the ability to make choices, and they are not responsible for their actions. Humans, on the other hand, are responsible for their actions and have the ability to make choices.  So, an animal that is suffering cannot be responsible for its suffering, while a human who is suffering often is.
IThisibeing the case, t is tight thing tdo focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we have a moral obligation to help those
 who are innocent and cannot help themselves.  Humans are often responsible for their own suffering, and they have the ability to help themselves, or should. By focusing on animal welfare over that of humans, we are merely living up to a basic moral principle.  In fact, if we were to focus on the well-being of humans instead in this situation, we would be doing something wrong.

Besides, just because a person places the welfare of animals over that of humans, it does not mean that they do not care about humans. I'm pretty sure that the people who expend effort and money towards furthering animal welfare are the same people who would spend time and money helping humans.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. In fact, I think it is the right thing to do.   think that people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people because animals are innocent.; they do not have the ability to make choices, and they are not responsible for their actions. Humans, on the other hand, are responsible for their actions and have the ability to make choices.  So, an animal that is suffering cannot be responsible for its suffering, while a human who is suffering often is.
IThisibeing the case, t is tight thing tdo focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we have a moral obligation to help those
 who are innocent and cannot help themselves.  Humans are often responsible for their own suffering, and they have the ability to help themselves, or should. By focusing on animal welfare over that of humans, we are merely living up to a basic moral principle.  In fact, if we were to focus on the well-being of humans instead in this situation, we would be doing something wrong.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. In fact, I think it is the right thing to do.   think that people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people because animals are innocent.; they do not have the ability to make choices, and they are not responsible for their actions. Humans, on the other hand, are responsible for their actions and have the ability to make choices.  So, an animal that is suffering cannot be responsible for its suffering, while a human who is suffering often is.
IThisibeing the case, t is tight thing tdo focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we have a moral obligation to help those
 who are innocent and cannot help themselves.  Humans are often responsible for their own suffering, and they have the ability to help themselves, or should. By focusing on animal welfare over that of humans, we are merely living up to a basic moral principle.  In fact, if we were to focus on the well-being of humans instead in this situation, we would be doing something wrong.

Besides, just because a person places the welfare of animals over that of humans, it does not mean that they do not care about humans. I'm pretty sure that the people who expend effort and money towards furthering animal welfare are the same people who would spend time and money helping humans. I'm also sure that the people who raise this issue, and insist that animals are less important that humans, are the same people who would not help humans in need. The whole question is a false dichotomy. Helping animals is important, and moral, and so is",user,21,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. In fact, I think it is the right thing to do.   think that people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people because animals are innocent.; they do not have the ability to make choices, and they are not responsible for their actions. Humans, on the other hand, are responsible for their actions and have the ability to make choices.  So, an animal that is suffering cannot be responsible for its suffering, while a human who is suffering often is.
IThisibeing the case, t is tight thing tdo focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we have a moral obligation to help those
 who are innocent and cannot help themselves.  Humans are often responsible for their own suffering, and they have the ability to help themselves, or should. By focusing on animal welfare over that of humans, we are merely living up to a basic moral principle.  In fact, if we were to focus on the well-being of humans instead in this situation, we would be doing something wrong.

Besides, just because a person places the welfare of animals over that of humans, it does not mean that they do not care about humans. I'm pretty sure that the people who expend effort and money towards furthering animal welfare are the same people who would spend time and money helping humans.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. In fact, I think it is the right thing to do.   think that people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people because animals are innocent.; they do not have the ability to make choices, and they are not responsible for their actions. Humans, on the other hand, are responsible for their actions and have the ability to make choices.  So, an animal that is suffering cannot be responsible for its suffering, while a human who is suffering often is.
IThisibeing the case, t is tight thing tdo focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we have a moral obligation to help those
 who are innocent and cannot help themselves.  Humans are often responsible for their own suffering, and they have the ability to help themselves, or should. By focusing on animal welfare over that of humans, we are merely living up to a basic moral principle.  In fact, if we were to focus on the well-being of humans instead in this situation, we would be doing something wrong.

Besides, just because a person places the welfare of animals over that of humans, it does not mean that they do not care about humans. I'm pretty sure that the people who expend effort and money towards furthering animal welfare are the same people who would spend time and money helping humans. I'm also sure that the people who raise this issue, and insist that animals are less important that humans, are the same people who would not help humans in need. The whole question is a false dichotomy. Helping animals is important, and moral, and so is helping humans. People will get the help that they need",user,22,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. In fact, I think it is the right thing to do.   think that people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people because animals are innocent.; they do not have the ability to make choices, and they are not responsible for their actions. Humans, on the other hand, are responsible for their actions and have the ability to make choices.  So, an animal that is suffering cannot be responsible for its suffering, while a human who is suffering often is.
IThisibeing the case, t is tight thing tdo focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we have a moral obligation to help those
 who are innocent and cannot help themselves.  Humans are often responsible for their own suffering, and they have the ability to help themselves, or should. By focusing on animal welfare over that of humans, we are merely living up to a basic moral principle.  In fact, if we were to focus on the well-being of humans instead in this situation, we would be doing something wrong.

Besides, just because a person places the welfare of animals over that of humans, it does not mean that they do not care about humans. I'm pretty sure that the people who expend effort and money towards furthering animal welfare are the same people who would spend time and money helping humans. I'm also sure that the people who raise this issue, and insist that animals are less important that humans, are the same people who would not help humans in need.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. In fact, I think it is the right thing to do.   think that people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people because animals are innocent.; they do not have the ability to make choices, and they are not responsible for their actions. Humans, on the other hand, are responsible for their actions and have the ability to make choices.  So, an animal that is suffering cannot be responsible for its suffering, while a human who is suffering often is.
IThisibeing the case, t is tight thing tdo focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we have a moral obligation to help those
 who are innocent and cannot help themselves.  Humans are often responsible for their own suffering, and they have the ability to help themselves, or should. By focusing on animal welfare over that of humans, we are merely living up to a basic moral principle.  In fact, if we were to focus on the well-being of humans instead in this situation, we would be doing something wrong.

Besides, just because a person places the welfare of animals over that of humans, it does not mean that they do not care about humans. I'm pretty sure that the people who expend effort and money towards furthering animal welfare are the same people who would spend time and money helping humans. I'm also sure that the people who raise this issue, and insist that animals are less important that humans, are the same people who would not help humans in need. The whole question is a false dichotomy. Helping animals is important, and moral, and so is helping humans. People will get the help that they need. They'll just have to wait their tur",user,23,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
