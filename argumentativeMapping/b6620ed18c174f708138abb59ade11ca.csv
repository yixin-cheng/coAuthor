There is very little variety in modern film, because companies who make big movies are using data to hit the widest audience possible.

There is very little variety in modern film, because companies who make big movies are using data to hit the widest audience possible.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, Ryan Reynolds is cringeworthy. I don't know the person, and the actor is good, but the characterization of Deadpool leaves me feeling physically ill. It's a product of modern Hollywood, which has learned that the way to make the most money is to create a gory superhero movie. People eat that up and that seems to be the direction of the mindset of the general population. The power to kill is the greatest power. It's a sad state of affairs.

There is very little variety in modern film, because companies who make big movies are using data to hit the widest audience possible. The widest audience that they feel they can reach is the segment of the population who loves action oriented sequences, featuring intense, gory violence. They like the killer to make little jokes about it, as they kill. This is causing an indoctrination of that mindset in children, who superheroes were originally targeting. 
I'm not saying that there is no place for this kind of film, but it's getting out of hand.
 Most big movies revolve around superheroes, supervillains and a lot of violence. Since adults are consuming this material, the movies are geared toward adults. Kids still love their superheroes, so they are watching too.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, Ryan Reynolds is cringeworthy. I don't know the person, and the actor is good, but the characterization of Deadpool leaves me feeling physically ill. It's a product of modern Hollywood, which has learned that the way to make the most money is to create a gory superhero movie. People eat that up and that seems to be the direction of the mindset of the general population. The power to kill is the greatest power. It's a sad state of affairs.

There is very little variety in modern film, because companies who make big movies are using data to hit the widest audience possible. The widest audience that they feel they can reach is the segment of the population who loves action oriented sequences, featuring intense, gory violence. They like the killer to make little jokes about it, as they kill. This is causing an indoctrination of that mindset in children, who superheroes were originally targeting. 
I'm not saying that there is no place for this kind of film, but it's getting out of hand.
 Most big movies revolve around superheroes, supervillains and a lot of violence. Since adults are consuming this material, the movies are geared toward adults. Kids still love their superheroes, so they are watching too.

It's a product of modern Hollywood, which has learned that the way to make the most money is to create a gory superhero movie.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, Ryan Reynolds is cringeworthy. I don't know the person, and the actor is good, but the characterization of Deadpool leaves me feeling physically ill. It's a product of modern Hollywood, which has learned that the way to make the most money is to create a gory superhero movie. People eat that up and that seems to be the direction of the mindset of the general population. The power to kill is the greatest power. It's a sad state of affairs.

There is very little variety in modern film, because companies who make big movies are using data to hit the widest audience possible. The widest audience that they feel they can reach is the segment of the population who loves action oriented sequences, featuring intense, gory violence. They like the killer to make little jokes about it, as they kill. This is causing an indoctrination of that mindset in children, who superheroes were originally targeting. 
I'm not saying that there is no place for this kind of film, but it's getting out of hand.
 Most big movies revolve around superheroes, supervillains and a lot of violence. Since adults are consuming this material, the movies are geared toward adults. Kids still love their superheroes, so they are watching too. 
I think that the over-saturation of this kind of material is causing a lot of people to become desensitized to violence.
 Kids are playing video games where it's not uncommon to kill several hundred virtual people, in a single night. The movies that they are watching, and the characters they are learning to idolize, are also centered around killing and violence.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, Ryan Reynolds is cringeworthy. I don't know the person, and the actor is good, but the characterization of Deadpool leaves me feeling physically ill. It's a product of modern Hollywood, which has learned that the way to make the most money is to create a gory superhero movie. People eat that up and that seems to be the direction of the mindset of the general population. The power to kill is the greatest power. It's a sad state of affairs.

There is very little variety in modern film, because companies who make big movies are using data to hit the widest audience possible. The widest audience that they feel they can reach is the segment of the population who loves action oriented sequences, featuring intense, gory violence. They like the killer to make little jokes about it, as they kill. This is causing an indoctrination of that mindset in children, who superheroes were originally targeting. 
I'm not saying that there is no place for this kind of film, but it's getting out of hand.
 Most big movies revolve around superheroes, supervillains and a lot of violence. Since adults are consuming this material, the movies are geared toward adults. Kids still love their superheroes, so they are watching too. 
I think that the over-saturation of this kind of material is causing a lot of people to become desensitized to violence.
 Kids are playing video games where it's not uncommon to kill several hundred virtual people, in a single night. The movies that they are watching, and the characters they are learning to idolize, are also centered around killing and violence.

It's a product of modern Hollywood, which has learned that the way to make the most money is to create a gory superhero movie. People eat that up and that seems to be the direction of the mindset of the general population. The power to kill is the greatest power. It's a sad state of affairs.

There is very little variety in modern film, because companies who make big movies are using data to hit the widest audience possible. The widest audience that they feel they can reach is the segment of the population who loves action oriented sequences, featuring intense, gory violence. They like the killer to make little jokes about it, as they kill. This is causing an indoctrination of that mindset in children, who superheroes were originally targeting.

There is very little variety in modern film, because companies who make big movies are using data to hit the widest audience possible. The widest audience that they feel they can reach is the segment of the population who loves action oriented sequences, featuring intense, gory violence.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, Ryan Reynolds is cringeworthy. I don't know the person, and the actor is good, but the characterization of Deadpool leaves me feeling physically ill. It's a product of modern Hollywood, which has learned that the way to make the most money is to create a gory superhero movie. People eat that up and that seems to be the direction of the mindset of the general population. The power to kill is the greatest power. It's a sad state of affairs.

There is very little variety in modern film, because companies who make big movies are using data to hit the widest audience possible. The widest audience that they feel they can reach is the segment of the population who loves action oriented sequences, featuring intense, gory violence. They like the killer to make little jokes about it, as they kill. This is causing an indoctrination of that mindset in children, who superheroes were originally targeting. 
I'm not saying that there is no place for this kind of film, but it's getting out of hand.
 Most big movies revolve around superheroes, supervillains and a lot of violence. Since adults are consuming this material, the movies are geared toward adults. Kids still love their superheroes, so they are watching too. 
I think that the over-saturation of this kind of material is causing a lot of people to become desensitized to violence.
 Kids are playing video games where it's not uncommon to kill several hundred virtual people, in a single night. The movies that they are watching, and the characters they are learning to idolize, are also centered around killing and violence. 
I think that this is causing a lot of people to lose their sense of empathy.
 They are becoming desensitized to the suffering of others. I think that this is a very dangerous trend. Learning why killing is wrong has to be a cornerstone of childhood. Our society is going the other way. 
I'm not saying that we should ban violent movies, but I think that we should be more selective about what we allow our children to watch

In my opinion, Ryan Reynolds is cringeworthy. I don't know the person, and the actor is good, but the characterization of Deadpool leaves me feeling physically ill. It's a product of modern Hollywood, which has learned that the way to make the most money is to create a gory superhero movie. People eat that up and that seems to be the direction of the mindset of the general population. The power to kill is the greatest power. It's a sad state of affairs.

There is very little variety in modern film, because companies who make big movies are using data to hit the widest audience possible.

They like the killer to make little jokes about it, as they kill. This is causing an indoctrination of that mindset in children, who superheroes were originally targeting.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, Ryan Reynolds is cringeworthy. I don't know the person, and the actor is good, but the characterization of Deadpool leaves me feeling physically ill. It's a product of modern Hollywood, which has learned that the way to make the most money is to create a gory superhero movie. People eat that up and that seems to be the direction of the mindset of the general population. The power to kill is the greatest power. It's a sad state of affairs.

There is very little variety in modern film, because companies who make big movies are using data to hit the widest audience possible. The widest audience that they feel they can reach is the segment of the population who loves action oriented sequences, featuring intense, gory violence. They like the killer to make little jokes about it, as they kill. This is causing an indoctrination of that mindset in children, who superheroes were originally targeting. 
I'm not saying that there is no place for this kind of film, but it's getting out of hand.
 Most big movies revolve around superheroes, supervillains and a lot of violence. Since adults are consuming this material, the movies are geared toward adults. Kids still love their superheroes, so they are watching too. 
I think that the over-saturation of this kind of material is causing a lot of people to become desensitized to violence.
 Kids are playing video games where it's not uncommon to kill several hundred virtual people, in a single night. The movies that they are watching, and the characters they are learning to idolize, are also centered around killing and violence. 
I think that this is causing a lot of people to lose their sense of empathy.
 They are becoming desensitized to the suffering of others. I think that this is a very dangerous trend. Learning why killing is wrong has to be a cornerstone of childhood. Our society is going the other way. 
I'm not saying that we should ban violent movies, but I think that we should be more selective about what we allow our children to watch

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, Ryan Reynolds is cringeworthy. I don't know the person, and the actor is good, but the characterization of Deadpool leaves me feeling physically ill. It's a product of modern Hollywood, which has learned that the way to make the most money is to create a gory superhero movie. People eat that up and that seems to be the direction of the mindset of the general population. The power to kill is the greatest power. It's a sad state of affairs.

There is very little variety in modern film, because companies who make big movies are using data to hit the widest audience possible. The widest audience that they feel they can reach is the segment of the population who loves action oriented sequences, featuring intense, gory violence. They like the killer to make little jokes about it, as they kill. This is causing an indoctrination of that mindset in children, who superheroes were originally targeting. 
I'm not saying that there is no place for this kind of film, but it's getting out of hand.
 Most big movies revolve around superheroes, supervillains and a lot of violence. Since adults are consuming this material, the movies are geared toward adults. Kids still love their superheroes, so they are watching too. 
I think that the over-saturation of this kind of material is causing a lot of people to become desensitized to violence.
 Kids are playing video games where it's not uncommon to kill several hundred virtual people, in a single night. The movies that they are watching, and the characters they are learning to idolize, are also centered around killing and violence.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, Ryan Reynolds is cringeworthy. I don't know the person, and the actor is good, but the characterization of Deadpool leaves me feeling physically ill. It's a product of modern Hollywood, which has learned that the way to make the most money is to create a gory superhero movie. People eat that up and that seems to be the direction of the mindset of the general population. The power to kill is the greatest power. It's a sad state of affairs.

There is very little variety in modern film, because companies who make big movies are using data to hit the widest audience possible. The widest audience that they feel they can reach is the segment of the population who loves action oriented sequences, featuring intense, gory violence. They like the killer to make little jokes about it, as they kill. This is causing an indoctrination of that mindset in children, who superheroes were originally targeting. 
I'm not saying that there is no place for this kind of film, but it's getting out of hand.
 Most big movies revolve around superheroes, supervillains and a lot of violence. Since adults are consuming this material, the movies are geared toward adults. Kids still love their superheroes, so they are watching too. 
I think that the over-saturation of this kind of material is causing a lot of people to become desensitized to violence.
 Kids are playing video games where it's not uncommon to kill several hundred virtual people, in a single night. The movies that they are watching, and the characters they are learning to idolize, are also centered around killing and violence. 
I think that this is causing a lot of people to lose their sense of empathy.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, Ryan Reynolds is cringeworthy. I don't know the person, and the actor is good, but the characterization of Deadpool leaves me feeling physically ill. It's a product of modern Hollywood, which has learned that the way to make the most money is to create a gory superhero movie. People eat that up and that seems to be the direction of the mindset of the general population. The power to kill is the greatest power. It's a sad state of affairs.

There is very little variety in modern film, because companies who make big movies are using data to hit the widest audience possible. The widest audience that they feel they can reach is the segment of the population who loves action oriented sequences, featuring intense, gory violence. They like the killer to make little jokes about it, as they kill. This is causing an indoctrination of that mindset in children, who superheroes were originally targeting. 
I'm not saying that there is no place for this kind of film, but it's getting out of hand.
 Most big movies revolve around superheroes, supervillains and a lot of violence. Since adults are consuming this material, the movies are geared toward adults. Kids still love their superheroes, so they are watching too. 
I think that the over-saturation of this kind of material is causing a lot of people to become desensitized to violence.
 Kids are playing video games where it's not uncommon to kill several hundred virtual people, in a single night. The movies that they are watching, and the characters they are learning to idolize, are also centered around killing and violence. 
I think that this is causing a lot of people to lose their sense of empathy.

There is very little variety in modern film, because companies who make big movies are using data to hit the widest audience possible. The widest audience that they feel they can reach is the segment of the population who loves action oriented sequences, featuring intense, gory violence.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, Ryan Reynolds is cringeworthy. I don't know the person, and the actor is good, but the characterization of Deadpool leaves me feeling physically ill. It's a product of modern Hollywood, which has learned that the way to make the most money is to create a gory superhero movie. People eat that up and that seems to be the direction of the mindset of the general population. The power to kill is the greatest power. It's a sad state of affairs.

There is very little variety in modern film, because companies who make big movies are using data to hit the widest audience possible. The widest audience that they feel they can reach is the segment of the population who loves action oriented sequences, featuring intense, gory violence. They like the killer to make little jokes about it, as they kill. This is causing an indoctrination of that mindset in children, who superheroes were originally targeting. 
I'm not saying that there is no place for this kind of film, but it's getting out of hand.

I think that the over-saturation of this kind of material is causing a lot of people to become desensitized to violence.
 Kids are playing video games where it's not uncommon to kill several hundred virtual people, in a single night. The movies that they are watching, and the characters they are learning to idolize, are also centered around killing and violence.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, Ryan Reynolds is cringeworthy. I don't know the person, and the actor is good, but the characterization of Deadpool leaves me feeling physically ill. It's a product of modern Hollywood, which has learned that the way to make the most money is to create a gory superhero movie. People eat that up and that seems to be the direction of the mindset of the general population. The power to kill is the greatest power. It's a sad state of affairs.

There is very little variety in modern film, because companies who make big movies are using data to hit the widest audience possible. The widest audience that they feel they can reach is the segment of the population who loves action oriented sequences, featuring intense, gory violence. They like the killer to make little jokes about it, as they kill. This is causing an indoctrination of that mindset in children, who superheroes were originally targeting. 
I'm not saying that there is no place for this kind of film, but it's getting out of hand.
 Most big movies revolve around superheroes, supervillains and a lot of violence. Since adults are consuming this material, the movies are geared toward adults. Kids still love their superheroes, so they are watching too. 
I think that the over-saturation of this kind of material is causing a lot of people to become desensitized to violence.
 Kids are playing video games where it's not uncommon to kill several hundred virtual people, in a single night. The movies that they are watching, and the characters they are learning to idolize, are also centered around killing and violence. 
I think that this is causing a lot of people to lose their sense of empathy.
 They are becoming desensitized to the suffering of others. I think that this is a very dangerous trend. Learning why killing is wrong has to be a cornerstone of childhood. Our society is going the other way. 
I'm not saying that we should ban violent movies, but I think that we should be more selective about what we allow our children to watch
