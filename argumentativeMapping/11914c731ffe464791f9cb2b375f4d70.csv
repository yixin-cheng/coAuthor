In my opinion, audiobooks have many benefits over traditional reading. One is that people can listen to audiobooks while doing hands-free activities, such as cleaning the house or crafts such as knitting. I've personally found that such mindless activities are greatly enhanced by listening to a great audiobook while I do them. 
Another benefit of audiobooks is that you don't have to strain your eyes to read. Many people are vision impaired, making reading difficult, if not impossible with traditional books, and for those people, an audiobook allows them to be fully immersed in what they are reading. And even people with no vision impairment can have tired eyes at the end of a long work day which makes an audiobook a welcome break from the strain.Another benefit is that people can listen to audiobooks at night when the lights are down.

In my opinion, audiobooks have many benefits over traditional reading. One is that people can listen to audiobooks while doing hands-free activities, such as cleaning the house or crafts such as knitting. I've personally found that such mindless activities are greatly enhanced by listening to a great audiobook while I do them. 
Another benefit of audiobooks is that you don't have to strain your eyes to read. Many people are vision impaired, making reading difficult, if not impossible with traditional books, and for those people, an audiobook allows them to be fully immersed in what they are reading. And even people with no vision impairment can have tired eyes at the end of a long work day which makes an audiobook a welcome break from the strain.Another benefit is that people can listen to audiobooks at night when the lights are down.

In my opinion, audiobooks have many benefits over traditional reading. One is that people can listen to audiobooks while doing hands-free activities, such as cleaning the house or crafts such as knitting. I've personally found that such mindless activities are greatly enhanced by listening to a great audiobook while I do them. 
Another benefit of audiobooks is that you don't have to strain your eyes to read. Many people are vision impaired, making reading difficult, if not impossible with traditional books, and for those people, an audiobook allows them to be fully immersed in what they are reading. And even people with no vision impairment can have tired eyes at the end of a long work day which makes an audiobook a welcome break from the strain.Another benefit is that people can listen to audiobooks at night when the lights are down.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, audiobooks have many benefits over traditional reading. One is that people can listen to audiobooks while doing hands-free activities, such as cleaning the house or crafts such as knitting. I've personally found that such mindless activities are greatly enhanced by listening to a great audiobook while I do them. 
Another benefit of audiobooks is that you don't have to strain your eyes to read. Many people are vision impaired, making reading difficult, if not impossible with traditional books, and for those people, an audiobook allows them to be fully immersed in what they are reading. And even people with no vision impairment can have tired eyes at the end of a long work day which makes an audiobook a welcome break from the strain.Another benefit is that people can listen to audiobooks at night when the lights are down.
 I like this benefit personally because I have a partner who goes to bed very early. With an audiobook, I can still sit in the same room and enjoy it without waking him up by turning on the light.

In my opinion, audiobooks have many benefits over traditional reading. One is that people can listen to audiobooks while doing hands-free activities, such as cleaning the house or crafts such as knitting. I've personally found that such mindless activities are greatly enhanced by listening to a great audiobook while I do them.

Many people are vision impaired, making reading difficult, if not impossible with traditional books, and for those people, an audiobook allows them to be fully immersed in what they are reading.
