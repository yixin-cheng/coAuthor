In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate.

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of te",user,15,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on d",user,15,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face.

As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. Thi",user,16,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face.

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as so, which makes dating harder.",user,18,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face.

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate.

The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives.

Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And te",user,21,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them.

As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear.",user,21,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them.

Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things.

Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate.

When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

I have not used dating apps, but as far as social media and texting goes, I find them discouraging in terms of meeting someone. Then again, I had the same issues with traditional dating in the past, so I suppose that's just me. I think ultimately",user,24,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

I have not used dating apps, but as far as social media and texting goes, I find them discouraging in terms of meeting someone. Then again, I had the same issues with traditional dating in the past, so I suppose that's just me. I think ultimately that dating is still dating, and rel",user,24,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

I have not used dating apps, but as far as social media and texting goes, I find them discouraging in terms of meeting someone. Then again, I had the same issues with traditional dating in the past, so I suppose that's just me.

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

I have not used dating apps, but as far as social media and texting goes, I find them discouraging in terms of meeting someone.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

I have not used dating apps, but as far as social media and texting goes, I find them discouraging in terms of meeting someone. Then again, I had the same issues with traditional dating in the past, so I suppose that's just me.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things.

When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

I have not used dating apps, but as far as social media and texting goes, I find them discouraging in terms of meeting someone. Then again, I had the same issues with traditional dating in the past, so I suppose that's just me. I think ultimately that dating is still dating, and relationships are still relationships, no matter what changes one might make to them with technology. People who ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

I have not used dating apps, but as far as social media and texting goes, I find them discouraging in terms of meeting someone. Then again, I had the same issues with traditional dating in the past, so I suppose that's just me. I think ultimately that dating is still dating, and relationships are still relationships, no matter what changes one might make to them with technology.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

I have not used dating apps, but as far as social media and texting goes, I find them discouraging in terms of meeting someone. Then again, I had the same issues with traditional dating in the past, so I suppose that's just me. I think ultimately that dating is still dating, and relationships are still relationships, no matter what changes one might make to them with technology.

The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

I have not used dating apps, but as far as social media and texting goes, I find them discouraging in terms of meeting someone. Then again, I had the same issues with traditional dating in the past, so I suppose that's just me. I think ultimately that dating is still dating, and relationships are still relationships, no matter what changes one might make to them with technology.

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match.

Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

I have not used dating apps, but as far as social media and texting goes, I find them discouraging in terms of meeting someone.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

I have not used dating apps, but as far as social media and texting goes, I find them discouraging in terms of meeting someone. Then again, I had the same issues with traditional dating in the past, so I suppose that's just me. I think ultimately that dating is still dating, and relationships are still relationships, no matter what changes one might make to them with technology.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

I have not used dating apps, but as far as social media and texting goes, I find them discouraging in terms of meeting someone. Then again, I had the same issues with traditional dating in the past, so I suppose that's just me. I think ultimately that dating is still dating, and relationships are still relationships, no matter what changes one might make to them with technology.

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

I have not used dating apps, but as far as social media and texting goes, I find them discouraging in terms of meeting someone. Then again, I had the same issues with traditional dating in the past, so I suppose that's just me. I think ultimately that dating is still dating, and relationships are still relationships, no matter what changes one might make to them with technology.

As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

I have not used dating apps, but as far as social media and texting goes, I find them discouraging in terms of meeting someone. Then again, I had the same issues with traditional dating in the past, so I suppose that's just me. I think ultimately that dating is still dating, and relationships are still relationships, no matter what changes one might make to them with technology.

As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

I have not used dating apps, but as far as social media and texting goes, I find them discouraging in terms of meeting someone. Then again, I had the same issues with traditional dating in the past, so I suppose that's just me. I think ultimately that dating is still dating, and relationships are still relationships, no matter what changes one might make to them with technology.

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

I have not used dating apps, but as far as social media and texting goes, I find them discouraging in terms of meeting someone. Then again, I had the same issues with traditional dating in the past, so I suppose that's just me. I think ultimately that dating is still dating, and relationships are still relationships, no matter what changes one might make to them with technology. People who had an easy time with dating in the past, still will, and those, like me, who have found it a struggle, will continue to struggle, reg",user,25,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

I have not used dating apps, but as far as social media and texting goes, I find them discouraging in terms of meeting someone. Then again, I had the same issues with traditional dating in the past, so I suppose that's just me. I think ultimately that dating is still dating, and relationships are still relationships, no matter what changes one might make to them with technology.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.
