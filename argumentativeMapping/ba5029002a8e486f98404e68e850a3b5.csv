It makes no sense to say that harm to animals is less important than harm to people, because there is no way to find a characteristic of people that makes them more important in a moral calculus than animals.

What morally-relevant characteristic do humans have that animals don't? Intelligence?  No, because some animals are smarter than some humans (e.g., a chimp has more intelligence than a newborn baby). Self-awareness? Animals are self aware. Ability to know right from wrong? Many experiments show a moral sense in some animal species.

The list goes on. There is really no morally-relevant characteristic that decides what is more important: human or animal suffering.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

It makes no sense to say that harm to animals is less important than harm to people, because there is no way to find a characteristic of people that makes them more important in a moral calculus than animals.

What morally-relevant characteristic do humans have that animals don't? Intelligence?  No, because some animals are smarter than some humans (e.g., a chimp has more intelligence than a newborn baby). Self-awareness? Animals are self aware. Ability to know right from wrong? Many experiments show a moral sense in some animal species.

The list goes on. There is really no morally-relevant characteristic that decides what is more important: human or animal suffering.

It makes no sense to say that harm to animals is less important than harm to people, because there is no way to find a characteristic of people that makes them more important in a moral calculus than animals.

What morally-relevant characteristic do humans have that animals don't? Intelligence?  No, because some animals are smarter than some humans (e.g., a chimp has more intelligence than a newborn baby). Self-awareness? Animals are self aware. Ability to know right from wrong? Many experiments show a moral sense in some animal species.

The list goes on. There is really no morally-relevant characteristic that decides what is more important: human or animal suffering.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

The amount of cruelty in the world is staggering. Many millions of living things, human and animal, are made to suffer at the hands of others daily. It makes no sense to say that harm to animals is less important than harm to people, because there is no way to find a characteristic of people that makes them more important in a moral calculus than animals.

What morally-relevant characteristic do humans have that animals don't? Intelligence?  No, because some animals are smarter than some humans (e.g., a chimp has more intelligence than a newborn baby). Self-awareness? Animals are self aware. Ability to know right from wrong? Many experiments show a moral sense in some animal species.

The list goes on. There is really no morally-relevant characteristic that decides what is more important: human or animal suffering.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

The amount of cruelty in the world is staggering. Many millions of living things, human and animal, are made to suffer at the hands of others daily. It makes no sense to say that harm to animals is less important than harm to people, because there is no way to find a characteristic of people that makes them more important in a moral calculus than animals.

What morally-relevant characteristic do humans have that animals don't? Intelligence?  No, because some animals are smarter than some humans (e.g., a chimp has more intelligence than a newborn baby). Self-awareness? Animals are self aware. Ability to know right from wrong? Many experiments show a moral sense in some animal species.

The list goes on. There is really no morally-relevant characteristic that decides what is more important: human or animal suffering.

That means all harm to all living things is morally relevant. And people should care about both. It's not that it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. It's that there cannot to a moral defense of such a view that is neither circular nor specious.

It makes no sense to say that harm to animals is less important than harm to people, because there is no way to find a characteristic of people that makes them more important in a moral calculus than animals.

What morally-relevant characteristic do humans have that animals don't? Intelligence?  No, because some animals are smarter than some humans (e.g., a chimp has more intelligence than a newborn baby). Self-awareness? Animals are self aware. Ability to know right from wrong? Many experiments show a moral sense in some animal species.

The list goes on. There is really no morally-relevant characteristic that decides what is more important: human or animal suffering.

That means all harm to all living things is morally relevant. And people should care about both. It's not that it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. It's that there cannot to a moral defense of such a view that is neither circular nor specious. It must simply be a matter of personal preference -- and that is okay.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

The amount of cruelty in the world is staggering. Many millions of living things, human and animal, are made to suffer at the hands of others daily. It makes no sense to say that harm to animals is less important than harm to people, because there is no way to find a characteristic of people that makes them more important in a moral calculus than animals.

What morally-relevant characteristic do humans have that animals don't? Intelligence?  No, because some animals are smarter than some humans (e.g., a chimp has more intelligence than a newborn baby). Self-awareness? Animals are self aware. Ability to know right from wrong? Many experiments show a moral sense in some animal species.

The list goes on. There is really no morally-relevant characteristic that decides what is more important: human or animal suffering.

That means all harm to all living things is morally relevant. And people should care about both. It's not that it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. It's that there cannot to a moral defense of such a view that is neither circular nor specious. It must simply be a matter of personal preference -- and that is okay.

The amount of cruelty in the world is staggering. Many millions of living things, human and animal, are made to suffer at the hands of others daily.

What morally-relevant characteristic do humans have that animals don't? Intelligence?  No, because some animals are smarter than some humans (e.g., a a chimp has more intelligence than a newborn baby). Self-awareness? Animals are self aware. Ability to know right from wrong? Many experiments show a moral sense in some animal species.

The list goes on. There is really no morally-relevant characteristic that decides what is more important: human or animal suffering.
