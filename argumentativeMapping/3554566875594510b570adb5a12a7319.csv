In my opinion, technology has had a detrimental affect on relationships and dating., for many reasons.  We have lost the art of socializing and communicating face-to-face, which precludes a closer interaction between two people.  Due to unrealistic depictions in modern media, people develop unrealistic expectations of relationships and partner's personalities.  All these apps are about appearance, and have nothing to do with substance.  People spend hours curating a fake image online and attributing a persona that doesn't exist in real life..  Also, the images of their lives that they present on social media are far removed from their actual lives, all you see is the positives, not the negatives.   Then when it comes to meeting them they bare no resemblance to their presentation, either in appearance or what they do.  All of this creates an unreal expectation that cannot be met in real life.  People compare their romantic lives to those on TV and social media, causing increased dissatisfaction and disillusionment.  Dating apps also focus on the appearance over substance, and their is no development of an interpersonal relationship that exists in real life, which I think is vital to a healthy relationship.  People used to get to know each other, at work, in bars, at other social events, now they meet through a virtual world that encourages narcissism over human interactions.

In my opinion, technology has had a detrimental affect on relationships and dating., for many reasons.  We have lost the art of socializing and communicating face-to-face, which precludes a closer interaction between two people.  Due to unrealistic depictions in modern media, people develop unrealistic expectations of relationships and partner's personalities.  All these apps are about appearance, and have nothing to do with substance.  People spend hours curating a fake image online and attributing a persona that doesn't exist in real life..  Also, the images of their lives that they present on social media are far removed from their actual lives, all you see is the positives, not the negatives.   Then when it comes to meeting them they bare no resemblance to their presentation, either in appearance or what they do.  All of this creates an unreal expectation that cannot be met in real life.  People compare their romantic lives to those on TV and social media, causing increased dissatisfaction and disillusionment.  Dating apps also focus on the appearance over substance, and their is no development of an interpersonal relationship that exists in real life, which I think is vital to a healthy relationship.  People used to get to know each other, at work, in bars, at other social events, now they meet through a virtual world that encourages narcissism over human interactions.

In my opinion, technology has had a detrimental affect on relationships and dating., for many reasons.  We have lost the art of socializing and communicating face-to-face, which precludes a closer interaction between two people.  Due to unrealistic depictions in modern media, people develop unrealistic expectations of relationships and partner's personalities.  All these apps are about appearance, and have nothing to do with substance.  People spend hours curating a fake image online and attributing a persona that doesn't exist in real life..  Also, the images of their lives that they present on social media are far removed from their actual lives, all you see is the positives, not the negatives.   Then when it comes to meeting them they bare no resemblance to their presentation, either in appearance or what they do.  All of this creates an unreal expectation that cannot be met in real life.  People compare their romantic lives to those on TV and social media, causing increased dissatisfaction and disillusionment.  Dating apps also focus on the appearance over substance, and their is no development of an interpersonal relationship that exists in real life, which I think is vital to a healthy relationship.  People used to get to know each other, at work, in bars, at other social events, now they meet through a virtual world that encourages narcissism over human interactions.  All in all, I feel that our romantic lives have suffered in the digital age, that lack of social interaction is not conducive to growth of personal relationships.

In my opinion, technology has had a detrimental affect on relationships and dating., for many reasons.  We have lost the art of socializing and communicating face-to-face, which precludes a closer interaction between two people.  Due to unrealistic depictions in modern media, people develop unrealistic expectations of relationships and partner's personalities.  All these apps are about appearance, and have nothing to do with substance.  People spend hours curating a fake image online and attributing a persona that doesn't exist in real life..  Also, the images of their lives that they present on social media are far removed from their actual lives, all you see is the positives, not the negatives.   Then when it comes to meeting them they bare no resemblance to their presentation, either in appearance or what they do.  All of this creates an unreal expectation that cannot be met in real life.  People compare their romantic lives to those on TV and social media, causing increased dissatisfaction and disillusionment.  Dating apps also focus on the appearance over substance, and their is no development of an interpersonal relationship that exists in real life, which I think is vital to a healthy relationship.  People used to get to know each other, at work, in bars, at other social events, now they meet through a virtual world that encourages narcissism over human interactions.
