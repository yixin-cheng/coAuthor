Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, absolutely they should. They are literally personal hygiene products that teenage girls need access to when the time comes. School would be the worst place for a female student to have an issue like this. It could ruin a poor child's life for an extended period of time if a visible accident were to happen. So to me its not just the hygene issue here, its the social one. Perhaps an unpopular girl needs to borrow one because her school does not have any. It could turn into a very uncomfortable situation. These are just examples that I can think of and may not be that great but the point I am trying to get across here is that there would be no issues as long as schools had them readily available when needed at all times.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, absolutely they should. They are literally personal hygiene products that teenage girls need access to when the time comes. School would be the worst place for a female student to have an issue like this. It could ruin a poor child's life for an extended period of time if a visible accident were to happen.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, absolutely they should. They are literally personal hygiene products that teenage girls need access to when the time comes. School would be the worst place for a female student to have an issue like this. It could ruin a poor child's life for an extended period of time if a visible accident were to happen. So to me its not just the hygiene issue here, its the social one. Perhaps an unpopular girl needs to borrow one because her school does not have any. It could turn into a very uncomfortable situation. These are just examples that I can think of and may not be that great but the point I am trying to get across here is that there would be no issues as long as schools had them readily available when needed at all times. I think the worst thing that would happen is the boys get a hold of them and have childish fun with them but that is a small price to pay for the female students to have that kind of security.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, absolutely they should. They are literally personal hygiene products that teenage girls need access to when the time comes. School would be the worst place for a female student to have an issue like this. It could ruin a poor child's life for an extended period of time if a visible accident were to happen. So to me its not just the hygiene issue here, its the social one. Perhaps an unpopular girl needs to borrow one because her school does not have any. It could turn into a very uncomfortable situation. These are just examples that I can think of and may not be that great but the point I am trying to get across here is that there would be no issues as long as schools had them readily available when needed at all times.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, absolutely they should. They are literally personal hygiene products that teenage girls need access to when the time comes. School would be the worst place for a female student to have an issue like this. It could ruin a poor child's life for an extended period of time if a visible accident were to happen. So to me its not just the hygiene issue here, its the social one. Perhaps an unpopular girl needs to borrow one because her school does not have any. It could turn into a very uncomfortable situation. These are just examples that I can think of and may not be that great but the point I am trying to get across here is that there would be no issues as long as schools had them readily available when needed at all times. I think the worst thing that would happen is the boys get a hold of them and have childish fun with them but that is a small price to pay for the female students to have that kind of security. I also don't think it would be that costly either for the school systems to implement this nation wide. It surprises me that this has not already happened at a national level for all middle and high schoo",user,16,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
