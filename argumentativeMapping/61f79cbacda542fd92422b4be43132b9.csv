In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is when they are portrayed as a stereotype. It shows that the people who created the show or the movie don't understand the depths of a character and are shallow people in general.

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is when they are portrayed as a stereotype. It shows that the people who created the show or the movie don't understand the depths of a character and are shallow people in general. 

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is when they are portrayed as a stereotype. It shows that the people who created the show or the movie don't understand the depths of a character and are shallow people in general. 

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is when they are portrayed as a stereotype. It shows that the people who created the show or the movie don't understand the depths of a character and are shallow people in general. 

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

The entire depth of his character wasn't that he was a stereotypical Italian. You kind of forgot about that while you were watching the show. 

That to me is a stereotype done right, even though stereotypes have a negative stigma around them. And realistically, all stereotypes are negative. Some just don't offend me to a great extent.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is when they are portrayed as a stereotype. It shows that the people who created the show or the movie don't understand the depths of a character and are shallow people in general. 

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

The entire depth of his character wasn't that he was a stereotypical Italian. You kind of forgot about that while you were watching the show.

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

The entire depth of his character wasn't that he was a stereotypical Italian. You kind of forgot about that while you were watching the show. 

That to me is a stereotype done right, even though stereotypes have a negative stigma around them. And realistically, all stereotypes are negative. Some just don't offend me to a great extent.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

The entire depth of his character wasn't that he was a stereotypical Italian. You kind of forgot about that while you were watching the show. 

That to me is a stereotype done right, even though stereotypes have a negative stigma around them. And realistically, all stereotypes are negative. Some just don't offend me to a great extent.

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is when they are portrayed as a stereotype. It shows that the people who created the show or the movie don't understand the depths of a character and are shallow people in general. 

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

The entire depth of his character wasn't that he was a stereotypical Italian. You kind of forgot about that while you were watching the show. 

That to me is a stereotype done right, even though stereotypes have a negative stigma around them. And realistically, all stereotypes are negative. Some just don't offend me to a great extent.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is when they are portrayed as a stereotype. It shows that the people who created the show or the movie don't understand the depths of a character and are shallow people in general. 

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

The entire depth of his character wasn't that he was a stereotypical Italian. You kind of forgot about that while you were watching the show.

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is when they are portrayed as a stereotype. It shows that the people who created the show or the movie don't understand the depths of a character and are shallow people in general. 

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is when they are portrayed as a stereotype. It shows that the people who created the show or the movie don't understand the depths of a character and are shallow people in general. 

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

The entire depth of his character wasn't that he was a stereotypical Italian. You kind of forgot about that while you were watching the show. 

That to me is a stereotype done right, even though stereotypes have a negative stigma around them. And realistically, all stereotypes are negative. Some just don't offend me to a great extent.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is when they are portrayed as a stereotype. It shows that the people who created the show or the movie don't understand the depths of a character and are shallow people in general. 

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

The entire depth of his character wasn't that he was a stereotypical Italian. You kind of forgot about that while you were watching the show. 

That to me is a stereotype done right, even though stereotypes have a negative stigma around them. And realistically, all stereotypes are negative. Some just don't offend me to a great extent.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is when they are portrayed as a stereotype. It shows that the people who created the show or the movie don't understand the depths of a character and are shallow people in general. 

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

The entire depth of his character wasn't that he was a stereotypical Italian. You kind of forgot about that while you were watching the show. 

That to me is a stereotype done right, even though stereotypes have a negative stigma around them. And realistically, all stereotypes are negative. Some just don't offend me to a great extent.

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

The entire depth of his character wasn't that he was a stereotypical Italian. You kind of forgot about that while you were watching the show. 

That to me is a stereotype done right, even though stereotypes have a negative stigma around them. And realistically, all stereotypes are negative. Some just don't offend me to a great extent.

I definitely wouldn't watch a specific television show or a movie if a character was being portrayed in a highly offensive and stereotypical way. I understand that some people use stereotypes to teach a viewing audience about past culture.

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

The entire depth of his character wasn't that he was a stereotypical Italian. You kind of forgot about that while you were watching the show. 

That to me is a stereotype done right, even though stereotypes have a negative stigma around them. And realistically, all stereotypes are negative. Some just don't offend me to a great extent.

I definitely wouldn't watch a specific television show or a movie if a character was being portrayed in a highly offensive and stereotypical way. I understand that some people use stereotypes to teach a viewing audience about past culture.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

The entire depth of his character wasn't that he was a stereotypical Italian. You kind of forgot about that while you were watching the show. 

That to me is a stereotype done right, even though stereotypes have a negative stigma around them. And realistically, all stereotypes are negative. Some just don't offend me to a great extent.

I definitely wouldn't watch a specific television show or a movie if a character was being portrayed in a highly offensive and stereotypical way. I understand that some people use stereotypes to teach a viewing audience about past culture.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is when they are portrayed as a stereotype. It shows that the people who created the show or the movie don't understand the depths of a character and are shallow people in general. 

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

The entire depth of his character wasn't that he was a stereotypical Italian. You kind of forgot about that while you were watching the show. 

That to me is a stereotype done right, even though stereotypes have a negative stigma around them. And realistically, all stereotypes are negative. Some just don't offend me to a great extent.

I definitely wouldn't watch a specific television show or a movie if a character was being portrayed in a highly offensive and stereotypical way. I understand that some people use stereotypes to teach a viewing audience about past culture.

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

The entire depth of his character wasn't that he was a stereotypical Italian. You kind of forgot about that while you were watching the show. 

That to me is a stereotype done right, even though stereotypes have a negative stigma around them. And realistically, all stereotypes are negative. Some just don't offend me to a great extent.

I definitely wouldn't watch a specific television show or a movie if a character was being portrayed in a highly offensive and stereotypical way. I understand that some people use stereotypes to teach a viewing audience about past culture.

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is when they are portrayed as a stereotype. It shows that the people who created the show or the movie don't understand the depths of a character and are shallow people in general.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is when they are portrayed as a stereotype. It shows that the people who created the show or the movie don't understand the depths of a character and are shallow people in general. 

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

The entire depth of his character wasn't that he was a stereotypical Italian. You kind of forgot about that while you were watching the show. 

That to me is a stereotype done right, even though stereotypes have a negative stigma around them. And realistically, all stereotypes are negative. Some just don't offend me to a great extent.

I definitely wouldn't watch a specific television show or a movie if a character was being portrayed in a highly offensive and stereotypical way. I understand that some people use stereotypes to teach a viewing audience about past culture.

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is when they are portrayed as a stereotype. It shows that the people who created the show or the movie don't understand the depths of a character and are shallow people in general.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is when they are portrayed as a stereotype. It shows that the people who created the show or the movie don't understand the depths of a character and are shallow people in general. 

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

The entire depth of his character wasn't that he was a stereotypical Italian. You kind of forgot about that while you were watching the show. 

That to me is a stereotype done right, even though stereotypes have a negative stigma around them. And realistically, all stereotypes are negative. Some just don't offend me to a great extent.

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is when they are portrayed as a stereotype. It shows that the people who created the show or the movie don't understand the depths of a character and are shallow people in general. 

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

The entire depth of his character wasn't that he was a stereotypical Italian. You kind of forgot about that while you were watching the show. 

That to me is a stereotype done right, even though stereotypes have a negative stigma around them. And realistically, all stereotypes are negative. Some just don't offend me to a great extent.

I definitely wouldn't watch a specific television show or a movie if a character was being portrayed in a highly offensive and stereotypical way. I understand that some people use stereotypes to teach a viewing audience about past culture. 

I also find stereotypes to be used less and less due to the societal backlash that comes with it. An audience isn't going to accept offensive stereotypes in movies and TV just because they're playing a character. The character has to have depth to them.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is when they are portrayed as a stereotype. It shows that the people who created the show or the movie don't understand the depths of a character and are shallow people in general. 

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is when they are portrayed as a stereotype. It shows that the people who created the show or the movie don't understand the depths of a character and are shallow people in general. 

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

The entire depth of his character wasn't that he was a stereotypical Italian. You kind of forgot about that while you were watching the show. 

That to me is a stereotype done right, even though stereotypes have a negative stigma around them. And realistically, all stereotypes are negative. Some just don't offend me to a great extent.

I definitely wouldn't watch a specific television show or a movie if a character was being portrayed in a highly offensive and stereotypical way. I understand that some people use stereotypes to teach a viewing audience about past culture. 

I also find stereotypes to be used less and less due to the societal backlash that comes with it. An audience isn't going to accept offensive stereotypes in movies and TV just because they're playing a character. The character has to have depth to them.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is when they are portrayed as a stereotype. It shows that the people who created the show or the movie don't understand the depths of a character and are shallow people in general. 

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

The entire depth of his character wasn't that he was a stereotypical Italian. You kind of forgot about that while you were watching the show. 

That to me is a stereotype done right, even though stereotypes have a negative stigma around them. And realistically, all stereotypes are negative. Some just don't offend me to a great extent.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is when they are portrayed as a stereotype. It shows that the people who created the show or the movie don't understand the depths of a character and are shallow people in general. 

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

The entire depth of his character wasn't that he was a stereotypical Italian. You kind of forgot about that while you were watching the show. 

That to me is a stereotype done right, even though stereotypes have a negative stigma around them. And realistically, all stereotypes are negative. Some just don't offend me to a great extent.
