It should definitely not be shameful to talk about as many women are experiencing it and it is a normal part of life. So yes, I am very much in favor of schools providing free pads and tampons to students. It is of the student's discretion on how she wants to handle it.

In my opinion, having a period is definitely a naturally occurring bodily function that is not shameful. It should definitely not be shameful to talk about as many women are experiencing it and it is a normal part of life.

This is daylight robbery, and our students in this country has had enough.

Second, proper history, education, and awareness of periods should be taught in schools. Even if a student is free to be discrete or open about their period, one thing's for sure: they should not be ashamed of it. If a student had a period accident, it shouldn't be a big deal.

Even if a student is free to be discrete or open about their period, one thing's for sure: they should not be ashamed of it. If a student had a period accident, it shouldn't be a big deal. Students should be able to talk about it freely without being shamed and probably the most important of all, is how teachers should have the capability and the authority to help a student that needs help with her period.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, having a period is definitely a naturally occurring bodily function that is not shameful. It should definitely not be shameful to talk about as many women are experiencing it and it is a normal part of life. So yes, I am very much in favor of schools providing free pads and tampons to students. It is of the student's discretion on how she wants to handle it. It can be as discrete or as open as she wants it to be, and I think it's time that we rethink how this naturally occurring bodily function has been quite a taboo in our society.

Firstly, how our government should allocate budget with getting rid of period poverty. Instead of allocating more funds in our military or in the police force, our government should allocate more funds in providing free pads and tampons to students. Senators are granted budgets for their Viagra pills and other medications, but why are our schools do not get budgets for free pads and tampons?

It should definitely not be shameful to talk about as many women are experiencing it and it is a normal part of life. So yes, I am very much in favor of schools providing free pads and tampons to students. It is of the student's discretion on how she wants to handle it. It can be as discrete or as open as she wants it to be, and I think it's time that we rethink how this naturally occurring bodily function has been quite a taboo in our society.

Firstly, how our government should allocate budget with getting rid of period poverty. Instead of allocating more funds in our military or in the police force, our government should allocate more funds in providing free pads and tampons to students. Senators are granted budgets for their Viagra pills and other medications, but why are our schools do not get budgets for free pads and tampons? This is daylight robbery, and our students in this country has had enough.

Second, proper history, education, and awareness of periods should be taught in schools. Even if a student is free to be discrete or open about their period, one thing's for sure: they should not be ashamed of it. If a student had a period accident, it shouldn't be a big deal. Students should be able to talk about it freely without being shamed and probably the most important of all, is how teachers should have the capability and the authority to help a student that needs help with her period.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, having a period is definitely a naturally occurring bodily function that is not shameful. It should definitely not be shameful to talk about as many women are experiencing it and it is a normal part of life. So yes, I am very much in favor of schools providing free pads and tampons to students. It is of the student's discretion on how she wants to handle it. It can be as discrete or as open as she wants it to be, and I think it's time that we rethink how this naturally occurring bodily function has been quite a taboo in our society.

Firstly, how our government should allocate budget with getting rid of period poverty. Instead of allocating more funds in our military or in the police force, our government should allocate more funds in providing free pads and tampons to students. Senators are granted budgets for their Viagra pills and other medications, but why are our schools do not get budgets for free pads and tampons? This is daylight robbery, and our students in this country has had enough.

Second, proper history, education, and awareness of periods should be taught in schools. Even if a student is free to be discrete or open about their period, one thing's for sure: they should not be ashamed of it. If a student had a period accident, it shouldn't be a big deal. Students should be able to talk about it freely without being shamed and probably the most important of all, is how teachers should have the capability and the authority to help a student that needs help with her period.

In my opinion, having a period is definitely a naturally occurring bodily function that is not shameful. It should definitely not be shameful to talk about as many women are experiencing it and it is a normal part of life. So yes, I am very much in favor of schools providing free pads and tampons to students. It is of the student's discretion on how she wants to handle it. It can be as discrete or as open as she wants it to be, and I think it's time that we rethink how this naturally occurring bodily function has been quite a taboo in our society.

Firstly, how our government should allocate budget with getting rid of period poverty. Instead of allocating more funds in our military or in the police force, our government should allocate more funds in providing free pads and tampons to students. Senators are granted budgets for their Viagra pills and other medications, but why are our schools do not get budgets for free pads and tampons? This is daylight robbery, and our students in this country has had enough.

Second, proper history, education, and awareness of periods should be taught in schools. Even if a student is free to be discrete or open about their period, one thing's for sure: they should not be ashamed of it. If a student had a period accident, it shouldn't be a big deal. Students should be able to talk about it freely without being shamed and probably the most important of all, is how teachers should have the capability and the authority to help a student that needs help with her period.

It should definitely not be shameful to talk about as many women are experiencing it and it is a normal part of life. So yes, I am very much in favor of schools providing free pads and tampons to students. It is of the student's discretion on how she wants to handle it. It can be as discrete or as open as she wants it to be, and I think it's time that we rethink how this naturally occurring bodily function has been quite a taboo in our society.

Firstly, how our government should allocate budget with getting rid of period poverty. Instead of allocating more funds in our military or in the police force, our government should allocate more funds in providing free pads and tampons to students. Senators are granted budgets for their Viagra pills and other medications, but why are our schools do not get budgets for free pads and tampons? This is daylight robbery, and our students in this country has had enough.

Second, proper history, education, and awareness of periods should be taught in schools. Even if a student is free to be discrete or open about their period, one thing's for sure: they should not be ashamed of it. If a student had a period accident, it shouldn't be a big deal. Students should be able to talk about it freely without being shamed and probably the most important of all, is how teachers should have the capability and the authority to help a student that needs help with her period.

In my opinion, having a period is definitely a naturally occurring bodily function that is not shameful. It should definitely not be shameful to talk about as many women are experiencing it and it is a normal part of life. So yes, I am very much in favor of schools providing free pads and tampons to students. It is of the student's discretion on how she wants to handle it. It can be as discrete or as open as she wants it to be, and I think it's time that we rethink how this naturally occurring bodily function has been quite a taboo in our society.

Firstly, how our government should allocate budget with getting rid of period poverty. Instead of allocating more funds in our military or in the police force, our government should allocate more funds in providing free pads and tampons to students. Senators are granted budgets for their Viagra pills and other medications, but why are our schools do not get budgets for free pads and tampons? This is daylight robbery, and our students in this country has had enough.

Second, proper history, education, and awareness of periods should be taught in schools. Even if a student is free to be discrete or open about their period, one thing's for sure: they should not be ashamed of it. If a student had a period accident, it shouldn't be a big deal. Students should be able to talk about it freely without being shamed and probably the most important of all, is how teachers should have the capability and the authority to help a student that needs help with her period.

And lastly, freedom of choice should be given to our students. It doesn't matter whether a student wants to use a tampon or a pad, they should be given the freedom to choose what they want to use. Th",user,21,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Second, proper history, education, and awareness of periods should be taught in schools. Even if a student is free to be discrete or open about their period, one thing's for sure: they should not be ashamed of it. If a student had a period accident, it shouldn't be a big deal. Students should be able to talk about it freely without being shamed and probably the most important of all, is how teachers should have the capability and the authority to help a student that needs help with her period.

It should definitely not be shameful to talk about as many women are experiencing it and it is a normal part of life. So yes, I am very much in favor of schools providing free pads and tampons to students. It is of the student's discretion on how she wants to handle it. It can be as discrete or as open as she wants it to be, and I think it's time that we rethink how this naturally occurring bodily function has been quite a taboo in our society.

Firstly, how our government should allocate budget with getting rid of period poverty. Instead of allocating more funds in our military or in the police force, our government should allocate more funds in providing free pads and tampons to students. Senators are granted budgets for their Viagra pills and other medications, but why are our schools do not get budgets for free pads and tampons? This is daylight robbery, and our students in this country has had enough.

Second, proper history, education, and awareness of periods should be taught in schools. Even if a student is free to be discrete or open about their period, one thing's for sure: they should not be ashamed of it. If a student had a period accident, it shouldn't be a big deal. Students should be able to talk about it freely without being shamed and probably the most important of all, is how teachers should have the capability and the authority to help a student that needs help with her period.

And lastly, freedom of choice should be given to our students. It doesn't matter whether a student wants to use a tampon or a pad, they should be given the freedom to choose what they want to use.

It should definitely not be shameful to talk about as many women are experiencing it and it is a normal part of life. So yes, I am very much in favor of schools providing free pads and tampons to students. It is of the student's discretion on how she wants to handle it. It can be as discrete or as open as she wants it to be, and I think it's time that we rethink how this naturally occurring bodily function has been quite a taboo in our society.

Firstly, how our government should allocate budget with getting rid of period poverty. Instead of allocating more funds in our military or in the police force, our government should allocate more funds in providing free pads and tampons to students. Senators are granted budgets for their Viagra pills and other medications, but why are our schools do not get budgets for free pads and tampons? This is daylight robbery, and our students in this country has had enough.

Second, proper history, education, and awareness of periods should be taught in schools. Even if a student is free to be discrete or open about their period, one thing's for sure: they should not be ashamed of it. If a student had a period accident, it shouldn't be a big deal. Students should be able to talk about it freely without being shamed and probably the most important of all, is how teachers should have the capability and the authority to help a student that needs help with her period.

And lastly, freedom of choice should be given to our students. It doesn't matter whether a student wants to use a tampon or a pad, they should be given the freedom to choose what they want to use. There shouldn't be any stigma about tampons being ""unladylike"" or ""gross"". Nor the menstrual pads being ""unhygienic"" or ""unsanitary"".

In my opinion, having a period is definitely a naturally occurring bodily function that is not shameful. It should definitely not be shameful to talk about as many women are experiencing it and it is a normal part of life.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, having a period is definitely a naturally occurring bodily function that is not shameful. It should definitely not be shameful to talk about as many women are experiencing it and it is a normal part of life. So yes, I am very much in favor of schools providing free pads and tampons to students. It is of the student's discretion on how she wants to handle it. It can be as discrete or as open as she wants it to be, and I think it's time that we rethink how this naturally occurring bodily function has been quite a taboo in our society.

Firstly, how our government should allocate budget with getting rid of period poverty. Instead of allocating more funds in our military or in the police force, our government should allocate more funds in providing free pads and tampons to students. Senators are granted budgets for their Viagra pills and other medications, but why are our schools do not get budgets for free pads and tampons? This is daylight robbery, and our students in this country has had enough.

Second, proper history, education, and awareness of periods should be taught in schools. Even if a student is free to be discrete or open about their period, one thing's for sure: they should not be ashamed of it. If a student had a period accident, it shouldn't be a big deal. Students should be able to talk about it freely without being shamed and probably the most important of all, is how teachers should have the capability and the authority to help a student that needs help with her period.

And lastly, freedom of choice should be given to our students. It doesn't matter whether a student wants to use a tampon or a pad, they should be given the freedom to choose what they want to use. There shouldn't be any stigma about tampons being ""unladylike"" or ""gross"". Nor the menstrual pads being ""unhygienic"" or ""unsanitary"". It's a matter of personal preference, and shame on anyone who thinks otherwise.

So yes, I am very much in favor of schools providing free pads and tampons to students. It is of the student's discretion on how she wants to handle it. It can be as discrete or as open as she wants it to be, and I think it's time that we rethink how this naturally occurring bodily function has been quite a taboo in our society.

Firstly, how our government should allocate budget with getting rid of period poverty. Instead of allocating more funds in our military or in the police force, our government should allocate more funds in providing free pads and tampons to students. Senators are granted budgets for their Viagra pills and other medications, but why are our schools do not get budgets for free pads and tampons? This is daylight robbery, and our students in this country has had enough.

Second, proper history, education, and awareness of periods should be taught in schools. Even if a student is free to be discrete or open about their period, one thing's for sure: they should not be ashamed of it. If a student had a period accident, it shouldn't be a big deal. Students should be able to talk about it freely without being shamed and probably the most important of all, is how teachers should have the capability and the authority to help a student that needs help with her period.

And lastly, freedom of choice should be given to our students. It doesn't matter whether a student wants to use a tampon or a pad, they should be given the freedom to choose what they want to use. There shouldn't be any stigma about tampons being ""unladylike"" or ""gross"". Nor the menstrual pads being ""unhygienic"" or ""unsanitary"". It's a matter of personal preference, and shame on anyone who thinks otherwise.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, having a period is definitely a naturally occurring bodily function that is not shameful. It should definitely not be shameful to talk about as many women are experiencing it and it is a normal part of life. So yes, I am very much in favor of schools providing free pads and tampons to students. It is of the student's discretion on how she wants to handle it. It can be as discrete or as open as she wants it to be, and I think it's time that we rethink how this naturally occurring bodily function has been quite a taboo in our society.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, having a period is definitely a naturally occurring bodily function that is not shameful. It should definitely not be shameful to talk about as many women are experiencing it and it is a normal part of life. So yes, I am very much in favor of schools providing free pads and tampons to students. It is of the student's discretion on how she wants to handle it. It can be as discrete or as open as she wants it to be, and I think it's time that we rethink how this naturally occurring bodily function has been quite a taboo in our society.

Firstly, how our government should allocate budget with getting rid of period poverty. Instead of allocating more funds in our military or in the police force, our government should allocate more funds in providing free pads and tampons to students. Senators are granted budgets for their Viagra pills and other medications, but why are our schools do not get budgets for free pads and tampons? This is daylight robbery, and our students in this country has had enough.

Second, proper history, education, and awareness of periods should be taught in schools.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, having a period is definitely a naturally occurring bodily function that is not shameful. It should definitely not be shameful to talk about as many women are experiencing it and it is a normal part of life. So yes, I am very much in favor of schools providing free pads and tampons to students. It is of the student's discretion on how she wants to handle it. It can be as discrete or as open as she wants it to be, and I think it's time that we rethink how this naturally occurring bodily function has been quite a taboo in our society.

Instead of allocating more funds in our military or in the police force, our government should allocate more funds in providing free pads and tampons to students. Senators are granted budgets for their Viagra pills and other medications, but why are our schools do not get budgets for free pads and tampons? This is daylight robbery, and our students in this country has had enough.

Second, proper history, education, and awareness of periods should be taught in schools. Even if a student is free to be discrete or open about their period, one thing's for sure: they should not be ashamed of it. If a student had a period accident, it shouldn't be a big deal. Students should be able to talk about it freely without being shamed and probably the most important of all, is how teachers should have the capability and the authority to help a student that needs help with her period.

And lastly, freedom of choice should be given to our students. It doesn't matter whether a student wants to use a tampon or a pad, they should be given the freedom to choose what they want to use. There shouldn't be any stigma about tampons being ""unladylike"" or ""gross"". Nor the menstrual pads being ""unhygienic"" or ""unsanitary"". It's a matter of personal preference, and shame on anyone who thinks otherwise.

So in the end, my point is simple. Periods are natural, and it should not be a taboo. Government a",user,26,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, having a period is definitely a naturally occurring bodily function that is not shameful. It should definitely not be shameful to talk about as many women are experiencing it and it is a normal part of life.

In my opinion, having a period is definitely a naturally occurring bodily function that is not shameful. It should definitely not be shameful to talk about as many women are experiencing it and it is a normal part of life. So yes, I am very much in favor of schools providing free pads and tampons to students. It is of the student's discretion on how she wants to handle it. It can be as discrete or as open as she wants it to be, and I think it's time that we rethink how this naturally occurring bodily function has been quite a taboo in our society.

Firstly, how our government should allocate budget with getting rid of period poverty. Instead of allocating more funds in our military or in the police force, our government should allocate more funds in providing free pads and tampons to students. Senators are granted budgets for their Viagra pills and other medications, but why are our schools do not get budgets for free pads and tampons? This is daylight robbery, and our students in this country has had enough.

Second, proper history, education, and awareness of periods should be taught in schools. Even if a student is free to be discrete or open about their period, one thing's for sure: they should not be ashamed of it. If a student had a period accident, it shouldn't be a big deal. Students should be able to talk about it freely without being shamed and probably the most important of all, is how teachers should have the capability and the authority to help a student that needs help with her period.

And lastly, freedom of choice should be given to our students. It doesn't matter whether a student wants to use a tampon or a pad, they should be given the freedom to choose what they want to use. There shouldn't be any stigma about tampons being ""unladylike"" or ""gross"". Nor the menstrual pads being ""unhygienic"" or ""unsanitary"". It's a matter of personal preference, and shame on anyone who thinks otherwise.

So in the end, my point is simple. Periods are natural, and it should not be a taboo. Government, schools, a",user,26,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, having a period is definitely a naturally occurring bodily function that is not shameful. It should definitely not be shameful to talk about as many women are experiencing it and it is a normal part of life. So yes, I am very much in favor of schools providing free pads and tampons to students. It is of the student's discretion on how she wants to handle it. It can be as discrete or as open as she wants it to be, and I think it's time that we rethink how this naturally occurring bodily function has been quite a taboo in our society.

Firstly, how our government should allocate budget with getting rid of period poverty. Instead of allocating more funds in our military or in the police force, our government should allocate more funds in providing free pads and tampons to students. Senators are granted budgets for their Viagra pills and other medications, but why are our schools do not get budgets for free pads and tampons? This is daylight robbery, and our students in this country has had enough.

Second, proper history, education, and awareness of periods should be taught in schools. Even if a student is free to be discrete or open about their period, one thing's for sure: they should not be ashamed of it. If a student had a period accident, it shouldn't be a big deal. Students should be able to talk about it freely without being shamed and probably the most important of all, is how teachers should have the capability and the authority to help a student that needs help with her period.

And lastly, freedom of choice should be given to our students. It doesn't matter whether a student wants to use a tampon or a pad, they should be given the freedom to choose what they want to use. There shouldn't be any stigma about tampons being ""unladylike"" or ""gross"". Nor the menstrual pads being ""unhygienic"" or ""unsanitary"". It's a matter of personal preference, and shame on anyone who thinks otherwise.

So yes, I am very much in favor of schools providing free pads and tampons to students. It is of the student's discretion on how she wants to handle it. It can be as discrete or as open as she wants it to be, and I think it's time that we rethink how this naturally occurring bodily function has been quite a taboo in our society.

Firstly, how our government should allocate budget with getting rid of period poverty. Instead of allocating more funds in our military or in the police force, our government should allocate more funds in providing free pads and tampons to students. Senators are granted budgets for their Viagra pills and other medications, but why are our schools do not get budgets for free pads and tampons? This is daylight robbery, and our students in this country has had enough.

Second, proper history, education, and awareness of periods should be taught in schools. Even if a student is free to be discrete or open about their period, one thing's for sure: they should not be ashamed of it. If a student had a period accident, it shouldn't be a big deal. Students should be able to talk about it freely without being shamed and probably the most important of all, is how teachers should have the capability and the authority to help a student that needs help with her period.

And lastly, freedom of choice should be given to our students. It doesn't matter whether a student wants to use a tampon or a pad, they should be given the freedom to choose what they want to use. There shouldn't be any stigma about tampons being ""unladylike"" or ""gross"". Nor the menstrual pads being ""unhygienic"" or ""unsanitary"". It's a matter of personal preference, and shame on anyone who thinks otherwise.

So in the end, my point is simple. Periods are natural, and it should not be a taboo. Government, schools, educators and students alike sho",user,26,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, having a period is definitely a naturally occurring bodily function that is not shameful.

Second, proper history, education, and awareness of periods should be taught in schools.

So yes, I am very much in favor of schools providing free pads and tampons to students. It is of the student's discretion on how she wants to handle it. It can be as discrete or as open as she wants it to be, and I think it's time that we rethink how this naturally occurring bodily function has been quite a taboo in our society.

Firstly, how our government should allocate budget with getting rid of period poverty. Instead of allocating more funds in our military or in the police force, our government should allocate more funds in providing free pads and tampons to students. Senators are granted budgets for their Viagra pills and other medications, but why are our schools do not get budgets for free pads and tampons? This is daylight robbery, and our students in this country has had enough.

Second, proper history, education, and awareness of periods should be taught in schools. Even if a student is free to be discrete or open about their period, one thing's for sure: they should not be ashamed of it. If a student had a period accident, it shouldn't be a big deal. Students should be able to talk about it freely without being shamed and probably the most important of all, is how teachers should have the capability and the authority to help a student that needs help with her period.

And lastly, freedom of choice should be given to our students. It doesn't matter whether a student wants to use a tampon or a pad, they should be given the freedom to choose what they want to use. There shouldn't be any stigma about tampons being ""unladylike"" or ""gross"". Nor the menstrual pads being ""unhygienic"" or ""unsanitary"". It's a matter of personal preference, and shame on anyone who thinks otherwise.

So in the end, my point is simple. Periods are natural, and it should not be a taboo. Government, schools, educators and students alike should all rally to help end period poverty. That ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, having a period is definitely a naturally occurring bodily function that is not shameful. It should definitely not be shameful to talk about as many women are experiencing it and it is a normal part of life. So yes, I am very much in favor of schools providing free pads and tampons to students. It is of the student's discretion on how she wants to handle it. It can be as discrete or as open as she wants it to be, and I think it's time that we rethink how this naturally occurring bodily function has been quite a taboo in our society.

Firstly, how our government should allocate budget with getting rid of period poverty. Instead of allocating more funds in our military or in the police force, our government should allocate more funds in providing free pads and tampons to students. Senators are granted budgets for their Viagra pills and other medications, but why are our schools do not get budgets for free pads and tampons? This is daylight robbery, and our students in this country has had enough.

Second, proper history, education, and awareness of periods should be taught in schools. Even if a student is free to be discrete or open about their period, one thing's for sure: they should not be ashamed of it. If a student had a period accident, it shouldn't be a big deal. Students should be able to talk about it freely without being shamed and probably the most important of all, is how teachers should have the capability and the authority to help a student that needs help with her period.

And lastly, freedom of choice should be given to our students. It doesn't matter whether a student wants to use a tampon or a pad, they should be given the freedom to choose what they want to use. There shouldn't be any stigma about tampons being ""unladylike"" or ""gross"". Nor the menstrual pads being ""unhygienic"" or ""unsanitary"". It's a matter of personal preference, and shame on anyone who thinks otherwise.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, having a period is definitely a naturally occurring bodily function that is not shameful. It should definitely not be shameful to talk about as many women are experiencing it and it is a normal part of life. So yes, I am very much in favor of schools providing free pads and tampons to students. It is of the student's discretion on how she wants to handle it. It can be as discrete or as open as she wants it to be, and I think it's time that we rethink how this naturally occurring bodily function has been quite a taboo in our society.

Firstly, how our government should allocate budget with getting rid of period poverty. Instead of allocating more funds in our military or in the police force, our government should allocate more funds in providing free pads and tampons to students. Senators are granted budgets for their Viagra pills and other medications, but why are our schools do not get budgets for free pads and tampons? This is daylight robbery, and our students in this country has had enough.

Second, proper history, education, and awareness of periods should be taught in schools. Even if a student is free to be discrete or open about their period, one thing's for sure: they should not be ashamed of it. If a student had a period accident, it shouldn't be a big deal. Students should be able to talk about it freely without being shamed and probably the most important of all, is how teachers should have the capability and the authority to help a student that needs help with her period.

And lastly, freedom of choice should be given to our students. It doesn't matter whether a student wants to use a tampon or a pad, they should be given the freedom to choose what they want to use. There shouldn't be any stigma about tampons being ""unladylike"" or ""gross"". Nor the menstrual pads being ""unhygienic"" or ""unsanitary"". It's a matter of personal preference, and shame on anyone who thinks otherwise.

So in the end, my point is simple. Periods are natural, and it should not be a taboo. Government, schools, educators and students alike should all rally to help end period poverty. That way the women of the future ",user,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Firstly, how our government should allocate budget with getting rid of period poverty. Instead of allocating more funds in our military or in the police force, our government should allocate more funds in providing free pads and tampons to students. Senators are granted budgets for their Viagra pills and other medications, but why are our schools do not get budgets for free pads and tampons? This is daylight robbery, and our students in this country has had enough.

Second, proper history, education, and awareness of periods should be taught in schools. Even if a student is free to be discrete or open about their period, one thing's for sure: they should not be ashamed of it. If a student had a period accident, it shouldn't be a big deal. Students should be able to talk about it freely without being shamed and probably the most important of all, is how teachers should have the capability and the authority to help a student that needs help with her period.

And lastly, freedom of choice should be given to our students. It doesn't matter whether a student wants to use a tampon or a pad, they should be given the freedom to choose what they want to use. There shouldn't be any stigma about tampons being ""unladylike"" or ""gross"". Nor the menstrual pads being ""unhygienic"" or ""unsanitary"". It's a matter of personal preference, and shame on anyone who thinks otherwise.

So in the end, my point is simple. Periods are natural, and it should not be a taboo. Government, schools, educators and students alike should all rally to help end period poverty. That way the women of the future are freer to ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

This is daylight robbery, and our students in this country has had enough.

Second, proper history, education, and awareness of periods should be taught in schools. Even if a student is free to be discrete or open about their period, one thing's for sure: they should not be ashamed of it. If a student had a period accident, it shouldn't be a big deal. Students should be able to talk about it freely without being shamed and probably the most important of all, is how teachers should have the capability and the authority to help a student that needs help with her period.

And lastly, freedom of choice should be given to our students. It doesn't matter whether a student wants to use a tampon or a pad, they should be given the freedom to choose what they want to use. There shouldn't be any stigma about tampons being ""unladylike"" or ""gross"". Nor the menstrual pads being ""unhygienic"" or ""unsanitary"". It's a matter of personal preference, and shame on anyone who thinks otherwise.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, having a period is definitely a naturally occurring bodily function that is not shameful. It should definitely not be shameful to talk about as many women are experiencing it and it is a normal part of life. So yes, I am very much in favor of schools providing free pads and tampons to students. It is of the student's discretion on how she wants to handle it. It can be as discrete or as open as she wants it to be, and I think it's time that we rethink how this naturally occurring bodily function has been quite a taboo in our society.
