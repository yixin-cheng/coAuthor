Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do. 

The difference is that animals don't have the level of consciousness  or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. 


On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness  or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the basis for the immorality child


On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With humans, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Hmans are able to reason, think critically, and express themselves with words.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness  or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them.

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness  or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? WHmans are able to reason, think critically, and express themselves with words.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness  or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness  or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punisHmans are able to reason, think critically, and express themselves with words.

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness  or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punished for? Did theyHmans are able to reason, think critically, and express themselves with words.

Animals don't have the level of consciousness  or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punished for? Did they strike the otherHmans are able to reason, think critically, and express themselves with words.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punished for? Did they strike the other person first. Hmans are able to reason, think critically, and express themselves with words.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punished for?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punished for? Did they strike the other person first. Hmans are able to reason, think critically, and express themselves with words.. Can't they defend themselves?

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punished for? Did they strike the other person first. Hmans are able to reason, think critically, and express themselves with words.. Can't they defend themselves?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punished for? Did they strike the other person first. Hmans are able to reason, think critically, and express themselves with words.. Can't they defend themselves?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punished for? Did they strike the other person first. Hmans are able to reason, think critically, and express themselves with words.. Can't they defend themselves?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punished for? Did they strike the other person first. Hmans are able to reason, think critically, and express themselves with words.. Can't they defend themselves?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punished for? Did they strike the other person first. Hmans are able to reason, think critically, and express themselves with words.. Can't they defend themselves?

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punished for?

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punished for? Did they strike the other person first. Hmans are able to reason, think critically, and express themselves with words.. Can't they defend themselves? 

This doubt is what makes a clear difference between human and animal abuse. Humans hurting humans can be retaliation, justice, or any other reason. With hum",user,26,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punished for? Did they strike the other person first. Hmans are able to reason, think critically, and express themselves with words.. Can't they defend themselves? 

This doubt is what makes a clear difference between human and animal abuse. Humans hurting humans can be retaliation, justice, or any other reason. With humans hurting animals, it's much ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punished for? Did they strike the other person first. Hmans are able to reason, think critically, and express themselves with words.. Can't they defend themselves?

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punished for? Did they strike the other person first. Hmans are able to reason, think critically, and express themselves with words.. Can't they defend themselves? 

This doubt is what makes a clear difference between human and animal abuse. Humans hurting humans can be retaliation, justice, or any other reason. With humans hurting animals, it's much more frequently the strong human using their",user,26,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't.

If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't.

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punished for? Did they strike the other person first. Hmans are able to reason, think critically, and express themselves with words.. Can't they defend themselves? 

This doubt is what makes a clear difference between human and animal abuse. Humans hurting humans can be retaliation, justice, or any other reason. With humans hurting animals, it's much more frequently the strong human using their power to hurt an often innocent and helpless anima",user,26,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punished for? Did they strike the other person first. Hmans are able to reason, think critically, and express themselves with words.. Can't they defend themselves? 

This doubt, co is what makes a clear difference between human and animal abuse. Humans hurting humans can be retaliation, justice, or any other reason.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punished for? Did they strike the other person first. Hmans are able to reason, think critically, and express themselves with words.. Can't they defend themselves? 

This doubt, consequence, and human religion is what makes a clear difference between human and animal abuse. Humans hurting humans can be retaliation, justice, or any other reason. With humans hurting animals, it's much more frequently the strong human using their power to hurt an often innocent and helpless animal.   Animal ab",user,27,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punished for? Did they strike the other person first. Hmans are able to reason, think critically, and express themselves with words.. Can't they defend themselves? 

This doubt, consequence, and human religion is what makes a clear difference between human and animal abuse. Humans hurting humans can be retaliation, justice, or any other reason. With humans hurting animals, it's much more frequently the strong human using their power to hurt an often innocent and helpless animal.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punished for?

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punished for? Did they strike the other person first. Hmans are able to reason, think critically, and express themselves with words.. Can't they defend themselves? 

This doubt, consequence, and human religion is what makes a clear difference between human and animal abuse. Humans hurting humans can be retaliation, justice, or any other reason. With humans hurting animals, it's much more frequently the strong human using their power to hurt an often innocent and helpless animal.   Animal abuse is more frequently wrong, and therefore, more widely condemned. ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
