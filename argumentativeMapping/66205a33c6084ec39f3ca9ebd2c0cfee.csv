Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way.

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way.

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment.

I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them. I also know a lot of individuals who, like me, have pets that they consider part of their family. I care more about my cat than a stranger and see them as equals in a way.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them. I also know a lot of individuals who, like me, have pets that they consider part of their family. I care more about my cat than a stranger and see them as equals in a way.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way.

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love.

For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them. I also know a lot of individuals who, like me, have pets that they consider part of their family. I care more about my cat than a stranger and see them as equals in a way. While some may disagree, there are enough people who see pets as family that it has become a part of our culture that we can form bonds with animals in this way.

People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them. I also know a lot of individuals who, like me, have pets that they consider part of their family. I care more about my cat than a stranger and see them as equals in a way. While some may disagree, there are enough people who see pets as family that it has become a part of our culture that we can form bonds with animals in this way.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them.

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them. I also know a lot of individuals who, like me, have pets that they consider part of their family. I care more about my cat than a stranger and see them as equals in a way. While some may disagree, there are enough people who see pets as family that it has become a part of our culture that we can form bonds with animals in this way.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them. I also know a lot of individuals who, like me, have pets that they consider part of their family. I care more about my cat than a stranger and see them as equals in a way.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them. I also know a lot of individuals who, like me, have pets that they consider part of their family. I care more about my cat than a stranger and see them as equals in a way. While some may disagree, there are enough people who see pets as family that it has become a part of our culture that we can form bonds with animals in this way.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them. I also know a lot of individuals who, like me, have pets that they consider part of their family. I care more about my cat than a stranger and see them as equals in a way. While some may disagree, there are enough people who see pets as family that it has become a part of our culture that we can form bonds with animals in this way.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them. I also know a lot of individuals who, like me, have pets that they consider part of their family. I care more about my cat than a stranger and see them as equals in a way.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans.

People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way.

While some may disagree, there are enough people who see pets as family that it has become a part of our culture that we can form bonds with animals in this way.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them. I also know a lot of individuals who, like me, have pets that they consider part of their family. I care more about my cat than a stranger and see them as equals in a way. While some may disagree, there are enough people who see pets as family that it has become a part of our culture that we can form bonds with animals in this way. 
In conclusion, I think many are just more empathetic to the plight of animals because they relate to them in only a loving way as the animals are innocent. And I don't think it's wr",user,23,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way.

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them. I also know a lot of individuals who, like me, have pets that they consider part of their family. I care more about my cat than a stranger and see them as equals in a way. While some may disagree, there are enough people who see pets as family that it has become a part of our culture that we can form bonds with animals in this way. 
In conclusion, I think many are just more empathetic to the plight of animals because they relate to them in only a loving way as the animals are innocent. And I don't think it's wrong to focus on animal we",user,23,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them. I also know a lot of individuals who, like me, have pets that they consider part of their family. I care more about my cat than a stranger and see them as equals in a way. While some may disagree, there are enough people who see pets as family that it has become a part of our culture that we can form bonds with animals in this way. 
In conclusion, I think many are just more empathetic to the plight of animals because they relate to them in only a loving way as the animals are innocent. And I don't think it's wrong to focus on animal welfare just because humans a",user,23,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

While some may disagree, there are enough people who see pets as family that it has become a part of our culture that we can form bonds with animals in this way.

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them. I also know a lot of individuals who, like me, have pets that they consider part of their family. I care more about my cat than a stranger and see them as equals in a way. While some may disagree, there are enough people who see pets as family that it has become a part of our culture that we can form bonds with animals in this way. 
In conclusion, I think many are just more empathetic to the plight of animals because they relate to them in only a loving way as the animals are innocent.

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them. I also know a lot of individuals who, like me, have pets that they consider part of their family. I care more about my cat than a stranger and see them as equals in a way. While some may disagree, there are enough people who see pets as family that it has become a part of our culture that we can form bonds with animals in this way. 
In conclusion, I think many are just more empathetic to the plight of animals because they relate to them in only a loving way as the animals are innocent. And I don't think it's wrong to focus on animal welfare just because humans are also suffering. They are bot",user,24,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

While some may disagree, there are enough people who see pets as family that it has become a part of our culture that we can form bonds with animals in this way.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way.

1865,text-insert,"Is It Wrong to Focus on Animal Welfare When Humans Are Suffering?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them. I also know a lot of individuals who, like me, have pets that they consider part of their family. I care more about my cat than a stranger and see them as equals in a way.

In conclusion, I think many are just more empathetic to the plight of animals because they relate to them in only a loving way as the animals are innocent. And I don't think it's wrong to focus on animal welfare just because humans are also suffering. They are both worthy causes that can coexist. ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
