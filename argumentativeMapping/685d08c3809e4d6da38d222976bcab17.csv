What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, Asians portrayed in American/western media can be very simplistic and offensive. They are often portrayed as being very smart, but also very socially awkward and shy. Being very smart in America is not looked kindly upon by a large minority of our population. So that too can be a damaging stereotype. I have known a variety of Asian people and some are smart, shy or awkward but most are just somewhere in between like the rest of us. Other then slight differences in facial features, they are just like every other human on earth. They fall along a spectrum of different social and personal types.   have also noticed that Asian men are often portrayed as being very effeminate.

In my opinion, Asians portrayed in American/western media can be very simplistic and offensive. They are often portrayed as being very smart, but also very socially awkward and shy. Being very smart in America is not looked kindly upon by a large minority of our population. So that too can be a damaging stereotype. I have known a variety of Asian people and some are smart, shy or awkward but most are just somewhere in between like the rest of us. Other then slight differences in facial features, they are just like every other human on earth. They fall along a spectrum of different social and personal types.   have also noticed that Asian men are often portrayed as being very effeminate.

In my opinion, Asians portrayed in American/western media can be very simplistic and offensive. They are often portrayed as being very smart, but also very socially awkward and shy. Being very smart in America is not looked kindly upon by a large minority of our population. So that too can be a damaging stereotype. I have known a variety of Asian people and some are smart, shy or awkward but most are just somewhere in between like the rest of us. Other then slight differences in facial features, they are just like every other human on earth. They fall along a spectrum of different social and personal types.   have also noticed that Asian men are often portrayed as being very effeminate.
