In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

I am not saying that I hated these movies. I'm just saying that I'm tired of seeing the same type of character over and over again. It's the same thing that when later American Idol winners were all white males with guitars. It's very rare that you see a female or a person of color win.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

I am not saying that I hated these movies. I'm just saying that I'm tired of seeing the same type of character over and over again.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

I am not saying that I hated these movies. I'm just saying that I'm tired of seeing the same type of character over and over again. It's the same thing that when later American Idol winners were all white males with guitars. It's very rare that you see a female or a person of color win.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

I am not saying that I hated these movies. I'm just saying that I'm tired of seeing the same type of character over and over again. It's the same thing that when later American Idol winners were all white males with guitars. It's very rare that you see a female or a person of color win.

I am not saying that I hated these movies. I'm just saying that I'm tired of seeing the same type of character over and over again. It's the same thing that when later American Idol winners were all white males with guitars. It's very rare that you see a female or a person of color win. It's definitely nothing specific that these actors have done or a specific action that they have made on their films, but the cringeworthy thought of the producers of these films having to do a meeting and say ""We need to have a white male lead.""

It's the same thing that when later American Idol winners were all white males with guitars. It's very rare that you see a female or a person of color win. It's definitely nothing specific that these actors have done or a specific action that they have made on their films, but the cringeworthy thought of the producers of these films having to do a meeting and say ""We need to have a white male lead.""

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

I am not saying that I hated these movies. I'm just saying that I'm tired of seeing the same type of character over and over again. It's the same thing that when later American Idol winners were all white males with guitars. It's very rare that you see a female or a person of color win. It's definitely nothing specific that these actors have done or a specific action that they have made on their films, but the cringeworthy thought of the producers of these films having to do a meeting and say ""We need to have a white male lead."" It's too obvious and something dare I say, a little bit racist.

I am not saying that I hated these movies. I'm just saying that I'm tired of seeing the same type of character over and over again. It's the same thing that when later American Idol winners were all white males with guitars. It's very rare that you see a female or a person of color win. It's definitely nothing specific that these actors have done or a specific action that they have made on their films, but the cringeworthy thought of the producers of these films having to do a meeting and say ""We need to have a white male lead."" It's too obvious and something dare I say, a little bit racist.

So my tip for Hollywood producers and to any producers of any show really, is to not be afraid to have a diverse cast. Whil",user,16,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

I am not saying that I hated these movies. I'm just saying that I'm tired of seeing the same type of character over and over again.

In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

I am not saying that I hated these movies. I'm just saying that I'm tired of seeing the same type of character over and over again. It's the same thing that when later American Idol winners were all white males with guitars. It's very rare that you see a female or a person of color win. It's definitely nothing specific that these actors have done or a specific action that they have made on their films, but the cringeworthy thought of the producers of these films having to do a meeting and say ""We need to have a white male lead."" It's too obvious and something dare I say, a little bit racist.

In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

I am not saying that I hated these movies. I'm just saying that I'm tired of seeing the same type of character over and over again. It's the same thing that when later American Idol winners were all white males with guitars. It's very rare that you see a female or a person of color win. It's definitely nothing specific that these actors have done or a specific action that they have made on their films, but the cringeworthy thought of the producers of these films having to do a meeting and say ""We need to have a white male lead."" It's too obvious and something dare I say, a little bit racist.

So my tip for Hollywood producers and to any producers of any show really, is to not be afraid to have a diverse cast. White male leads have had their time in the spotlight, it's time to give someone else a chance. The light towards the end of the tunnel is nearing,",user,17,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

I am not saying that I hated these movies. I'm just saying that I'm tired of seeing the same type of character over and over again. It's the same thing that when later American Idol winners were all white males with guitars. It's very rare that you see a female or a person of color win. It's definitely nothing specific that these actors have done or a specific action that they have made on their films, but the cringeworthy thought of the producers of these films having to do a meeting and say ""We need to have a white male lead."" It's too obvious and something dare I say, a little bit racist.

So my tip for Hollywood producers and to any producers of any show really, is to not be afraid to have a diverse cast. White male leads have had their time in the spotlight, it's time to give someone else a chance. The light towards the end of the tunnel is nearing, as we are actua",user,17,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

---

In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

I am not saying that I hated these movies. I'm just saying that I'm tired of seeing the same type of character over and over again. It's the same thing that when later American Idol winners were all white males with guitars. It's very rare that you see a female or a person of color win. It's definitely nothing specific that these actors have done or a specific action that they have made on their films, but the cringeworthy thought of the producers of these films having to do a meeting and say ""We need to have a white male lead."" It's too obvious and something dare I say, a little bit racist.

So my tip for Hollywood producers and to any producers of any show really, is to not be afraid to have a diverse cast. White male leads have had their time in the spotlight, it's time to give someone else a chance.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

I am not saying that I hated these movies. I'm just saying that I'm tired of seeing the same type of character over and over again. It's the same thing that when later American Idol winners were all white males with guitars. It's very rare that you see a female or a person of color win. It's definitely nothing specific that these actors have done or a specific action that they have made on their films, but the cringeworthy thought of the producers of these films having to do a meeting and say ""We need to have a white male lead."" It's too obvious and something dare I say, a little bit racist.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

I am not saying that I hated these movies. I'm just saying that I'm tired of seeing the same type of character over and over again. It's the same thing that when later American Idol winners were all white males with guitars. It's very rare that you see a female or a person of color win. It's definitely nothing specific that these actors have done or a specific action that they have made on their films, but the cringeworthy thought of the producers of these films having to do a meeting and say ""We need to have a white male lead."" It's too obvious and something dare I say, a little bit racist.

So my tip for Hollywood producers and to any producers of any show really, is to not be afraid to have a diverse cast. White male leads have had their time in the spotlight, it's time to give someone else a chance.

In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

I am not saying that I hated these movies. I'm just saying that I'm tired of seeing the same type of character over and over again. It's the same thing that when later American Idol winners were all white males with guitars. It's very rare that you see a female or a person of color win. It's definitely nothing specific that these actors have done or a specific action that they have made on their films, but the cringeworthy thought of the producers of these films having to do a meeting and say ""We need to have a white male lead."" It's too obvious and something dare I say, a little bit racist.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

I am not saying that I hated these movies. I'm just saying that I'm tired of seeing the same type of character over and over again. It's the same thing that when later American Idol winners were all white males with guitars. It's very rare that you see a female or a person of color win. It's definitely nothing specific that these actors have done or a specific action that they have made on their films, but the cringeworthy thought of the producers of these films having to do a meeting and say ""We need to have a white male lead."" It's too obvious and something dare I say, a little bit racist.

So my tip for Hollywood producers and to any producers of any show really, is to not be afraid to have a diverse cast. White male leads have had their time in the spotlight, it's time to give someone else a chance. The light towards the end of the tunnel is nearing, as we are actually seeing more and more diversity today, and I hope that this continues.

I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

I am not saying that I hated these movies. I'm just saying that I'm tired of seeing the same type of character over and over again. It's the same thing that when later American Idol winners were all white males with guitars. It's very rare that you see a female or a person of color win. It's definitely nothing specific that these actors have done or a specific action that they have made on their films, but the cringeworthy thought of the producers of these films having to do a meeting and say ""We need to have a white male lead."" It's too obvious and something dare I say, a little bit racist.

So my tip for Hollywood producers and to any producers of any show really, is to not be afraid to have a diverse cast. White male leads have had their time in the spotlight, it's time to give someone else a chance. The light towards the end of the tunnel is nearing, as we are actually seeing more and more diversity today, and I hope that this continues.

Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

I am not saying that I hated these movies. I'm just saying that I'm tired of seeing the same type of character over and over again. It's the same thing that when later American Idol winners were all white males with guitars. It's very rare that you see a female or a person of color win. It's definitely nothing specific that these actors have done or a specific action that they have made on their films, but the cringeworthy thought of the producers of these films having to do a meeting and say ""We need to have a white male lead."" It's too obvious and something dare I say, a little bit racist.

So my tip for Hollywood producers and to any producers of any show really, is to not be afraid to have a diverse cast. White male leads have had their time in the spotlight, it's time to give someone else a chance. The light towards the end of the tunnel is nearing, as we are actually seeing more and more diversity today, and I hope that this continues.

I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

I am not saying that I hated these movies. I'm just saying that I'm tired of seeing the same type of character over and over again. It's the same thing that when later American Idol winners were all white males with guitars. It's very rare that you see a female or a person of color win. It's definitely nothing specific that these actors have done or a specific action that they have made on their films, but the cringeworthy thought of the producers of these films having to do a meeting and say ""We need to have a white male lead."" It's too obvious and something dare I say, a little bit racist.

So my tip for Hollywood producers and to any producers of any show really, is to not be afraid to have a diverse cast. White male leads have had their time in the spotlight, it's time to give someone else a chance. The light towards the end of the tunnel is nearing, as we are actually seeing more and more diversity today, and I hope that this continues.
