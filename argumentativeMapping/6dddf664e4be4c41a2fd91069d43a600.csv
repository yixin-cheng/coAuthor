In my opinion,  I think that it is important to focus on both because it is crucial to help everyone. It is important to help animals because they are living things too and they deserve to be treated with respect, so is the case for humans. I think that it is wrong to focus on one and not the other because we are all living things and we all deserve to be treated equally. Both animals and humans have feelings and they both need help when they have sufferings. Priority should be given to the one with the worst suffering. In doing so, there will be more love in our society and no bias or prejudice, which is very important in creating a harmonious environment.  Remember that animals are humans' friends too. They are small and so they needprotection from humans. And sometimes, humans are weak and they also need empathy from other people. To conclude, I think that it is important to focus on both animals and humans because it is important to help everyone. ",user,13,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
