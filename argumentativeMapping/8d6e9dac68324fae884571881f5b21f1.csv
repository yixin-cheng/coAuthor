In my opinion, I totally do not think college level athletes should get paid. They are getting an education, which is payment enough. Let's face the facts here. While I agree these athletes are very talented, the majority of them will not be drafted by a pro level team. They will have to have a backup plan when they are done playing college sports. That's where their education will come in handy, for most at at least. 

I also agree with the article that if you paid these athletes, that really will create an air of an open market from the colleges to try to outbid each other for the athlete. Then they are not really worried about the students education, but more worried about how well the student can play. Often times the colleges will give passing grades to a failing athlete, just to keep them on the team. It even happens in high school where students are not paid. How would you like to hire a lawyer, doctor, or teacher and know they were not qualified enough, but the professional institution they learned from pushed them through?

While I agree these athletes are very talented, the majority of them will not be drafted by a pro level team. They will have to have a backup plan when they are done playing college sports. That's where their education will come in handy, for most at at least.

Then they are not really worried about the students education, but more worried about how well the student can play. Often times the colleges will give passing grades to a failing athlete, just to keep them on the team. It even happens in high school where students are not paid.

In my opinion, I totally do not think college level athletes should get paid. They are getting an education, which is payment enough. Let's face the facts here. While I agree these athletes are very talented, the majority of them will not be drafted by a pro level team. They will have to have a backup plan when they are done playing college sports. That's where their education will come in handy, for most at at least. 

I also agree with the article that if you paid these athletes, that really will create an air of an open market from the colleges to try to outbid each other for the athlete. Then they are not really worried about the students education, but more worried about how well the student can play. Often times the colleges will give passing grades to a failing athlete, just to keep them on the team. It even happens in high school where students are not paid.

In my opinion, I totally do not think college level athletes should get paid. They are getting an education, which is payment enough. Let's face the facts here. While I agree these athletes are very talented, the majority of them will not be drafted by a pro level team. They will have to have a backup plan when they are done playing college sports. That's where their education will come in handy, for most at at least. 

I also agree with the article that if you paid these athletes, that really will create an air of an open market from the colleges to try to outbid each other for the athlete. Then they are not really worried about the students education, but more worried about how well the student can play.

In my opinion, I totally do not think college level athletes should get paid. They are getting an education, which is payment enough. Let's face the facts here. While I agree these athletes are very talented, the majority of them will not be drafted by a pro level team. They will have to have a backup plan when they are done playing college sports. That's where their education will come in handy, for most at at least. 

I also agree with the article that if you paid these athletes, that really will create an air of an open market from the colleges to try to outbid each other for the athlete. Then they are not really worried about the students education, but more worried about how well the student can play. Often times the colleges will give passing grades to a failing athlete, just to keep them on the team. It even happens in high school where students are not paid. How would you like to hire a lawyer, doctor, or teacher and know they were not qualified enough, but the professional institution they learned from pushed them through?

In my opinion, I totally do not think college level athletes should get paid. They are getting an education, which is payment enough. Let's face the facts here. While I agree these athletes are very talented, the majority of them will not be drafted by a pro level team. They will have to have a backup plan when they are done playing college sports. That's where their education will come in handy, for most at at least. 

I also agree with the article that if you paid these athletes, that really will create an air of an open market from the colleges to try to outbid each other for the athlete. Then they are not really worried about the students education, but more worried about how well the student can play.

In my opinion, I totally do not think college level athletes should get paid. They are getting an education, which is payment enough. Let's face the facts here. While I agree these athletes are very talented, the majority of them will not be drafted by a pro level team. They will have to have a backup plan when they are done playing college sports. That's where their education will come in handy, for most at at least. 

I also agree with the article that if you paid these athletes, that really will create an air of an open market from the colleges to try to outbid each other for the athlete. Then they are not really worried about the students education, but more worried about how well the student can play. Often times the colleges will give passing grades to a failing athlete, just to keep them on the team. It even happens in high school where students are not paid. How would you like to hire a lawyer, doctor, or teacher and know they were not qualified enough, but the professional institution they learned from pushed them through?

In my opinion, I totally do not think college level athletes should get paid. They are getting an education, which is payment enough. Let's face the facts here. While I agree these athletes are very talented, the majority of them will not be drafted by a pro level team. They will have to have a backup plan when they are done playing college sports. That's where their education will come in handy, for most at at least. 

I also agree with the article that if you paid these athletes, that really will create an air of an open market from the colleges to try to outbid each other for the athlete. Then they are not really worried about the students education, but more worried about how well the student can play. Often times the colleges will give passing grades to a failing athlete, just to keep them on the team. It even happens in high school where students are not paid.

While I agree these athletes are very talented, the majority of them will not be drafted by a pro level team. They will have to have a backup plan when they are done playing college sports. That's where their education will come in handy, for most at at least. 

I also agree with the article that if you paid these athletes, that really will create an air of an open market from the colleges to try to outbid each other for the athlete. Then they are not really worried about the students education, but more worried about how well the student can play. Often times the colleges will give passing grades to a failing athlete, just to keep them on the team. It even happens in high school where students are not paid. How would you like to hire a lawyer, doctor, or teacher and know they were not qualified enough, but the professional institution they learned from pushed them through?

In my opinion, I totally do not think college level athletes should get paid. They are getting an education, which is payment enough. Let's face the facts here. While I agree these athletes are very talented, the majority of them will not be drafted by a pro level team. They will have to have a backup plan when they are done playing college sports. That's where their education will come in handy, for most at at least. 

I also agree with the article that if you paid these athletes, that really will create an air of an open market from the colleges to try to outbid each other for the athlete. Then they are not really worried about the students education, but more worried about how well the student can play. Often times the colleges will give passing grades to a failing athlete, just to keep them on the team. It even happens in high school where students are not paid. How would you like to hire a lawyer, doctor, or teacher and know they were not qualified enough, but the professional institution they learned from pushed them through?

In my opinion, I totally do not think college level athletes should get paid. They are getting an education, which is payment enough. Let's face the facts here. While I agree these athletes are very talented, the majority of them will not be drafted by a pro level team. They will have to have a backup plan when they are done playing college sports. That's where their education will come in handy, for most at at least. 

I also agree with the article that if you paid these athletes, that really will create an air of an open market from the colleges to try to outbid each other for the athlete. Then they are not really worried about the students education, but more worried about how well the student can play.

While I agree these athletes are very talented, the majority of them will not be drafted by a pro level team. They will have to have a backup plan when they are done playing college sports. That's where their education will come in handy, for most at at least. 

I also agree with the article that if you paid these athletes, that really will create an air of an open market from the colleges to try to outbid each other for the athlete. Then they are not really worried about the students education, but more worried about how well the student can play. Often times the colleges will give passing grades to a failing athlete, just to keep them on the team. It even happens in high school where students are not paid. How would you like to hire a lawyer, doctor, or teacher and know they were not qualified enough, but the professional institution they learned from pushed them through?

Another thing I can see would arise from the issue is the colleges would pay the big name athletes sports such as basketball, or football, but the intellectual athletes, such as chess players or debate clubs would get nothing except maybe appreciation for their sport.

In my opinion, I totally do not think college level athletes should get paid. They are getting an education, which is payment enough. Let's face the facts here. While I agree these athletes are very talented, the majority of them will not be drafted by a pro level team. They will have to have a backup plan when they are done playing college sports. That's where their education will come in handy, for most at at least. 

I also agree with the article that if you paid these athletes, that really will create an air of an open market from the colleges to try to outbid each other for the athlete. Then they are not really worried about the students education, but more worried about how well the student can play. Often times the colleges will give passing grades to a failing athlete, just to keep them on the team. It even happens in high school where students are not paid.

In my opinion, I totally do not think college level athletes should get paid. They are getting an education, which is payment enough. Let's face the facts here. While I agree these athletes are very talented, the majority of them will not be drafted by a pro level team. They will have to have a backup plan when they are done playing college sports. That's where their education will come in handy, for most at at least. 

I also agree with the article that if you paid these athletes, that really will create an air of an open market from the colleges to try to outbid each other for the athlete. Then they are not really worried about the students education, but more worried about how well the student can play. Often times the colleges will give passing grades to a failing athlete, just to keep them on the team. It even happens in high school where students are not paid. How would you like to hire a lawyer, doctor, or teacher and know they were not qualified enough, but the professional institution they learned from pushed them through?

Another thing I can see would arise from the issue is the colleges would pay the big name athletes sports such as basketball, or football, but the intellectual athletes, such as chess players or debate clubs would get nothing except maybe appreciation for their sport.

While I agree these athletes are very talented, the majority of them will not be drafted by a pro level team. They will have to have a backup plan when they are done playing college sports. That's where their education will come in handy, for most at at least. 

I also agree with the article that if you paid these athletes, that really will create an air of an open market from the colleges to try to outbid each other for the athlete. Then they are not really worried about the students education, but more worried about how well the student can play. Often times the colleges will give passing grades to a failing athlete, just to keep them on the team. It even happens in high school where students are not paid. How would you like to hire a lawyer, doctor, or teacher and know they were not qualified enough, but the professional institution they learned from pushed them through?

Another thing I can see would arise from the issue is the colleges would pay the big name athletes sports such as basketball, or football, but the intellectual athletes, such as chess players or debate clubs would get nothing except maybe appreciation for their sport.

In my opinion, I totally do not think college level athletes should get paid. They are getting an education, which is payment enough. Let's face the facts here. While I agree these athletes are very talented, the majority of them will not be drafted by a pro level team. They will have to have a backup plan when they are done playing college sports. That's where their education will come in handy, for most at at least. 

I also agree with the article that if you paid these athletes, that really will create an air of an open market from the colleges to try to outbid each other for the athlete. Then they are not really worried about the students education, but more worried about how well the student can play. Often times the colleges will give passing grades to a failing athlete, just to keep them on the team. It even happens in high school where students are not paid. How would you like to hire a lawyer, doctor, or teacher and know they were not qualified enough, but the professional institution they learned from pushed them through?

Another thing I can see would arise from the issue is the colleges would pay the big name athletes sports such as basketball, or football, but the intellectual athletes, such as chess players or debate clubs would get nothing except maybe appreciation for their sport.

In my opinion, I totally do not think college level athletes should get paid. They are getting an education, which is payment enough. Let's face the facts here. While I agree these athletes are very talented, the majority of them will not be drafted by a pro level team. They will have to have a backup plan when they are done playing college sports. That's where their education will come in handy, for most at at least. 

I also agree with the article that if you paid these athletes, that really will create an air of an open market from the colleges to try to outbid each other for the athlete. Then they are not really worried about the students education, but more worried about how well the student can play. Often times the colleges will give passing grades to a failing athlete, just to keep them on the team. It even happens in high school where students are not paid. How would you like to hire a lawyer, doctor, or teacher and know they were not qualified enough, but the professional institution they learned from pushed them through?

Another thing I can see would arise from the issue is the colleges would pay the big name athletes sports such as basketball, or football, but the intellectual athletes, such as chess players or debate clubs would get nothing except maybe appreciation for their sport.
