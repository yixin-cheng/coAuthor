In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers.

Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortur",user,17,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples.

Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventua",user,21,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere.

Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away. Meanwhile, the teachers and kids in school kept me   on the straight and narrow, and they taught me how to be a good person. If I step",user,23,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away. Meanwhile, the teachers and kids in school kept me   on the straight and narrow, and they taught me how to be a good person. If I stepped out of line, they punished me, and they made me feel bad about myself",user,23,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away. Meanwhile, the teachers and kids in school kept me   on the straight and narrow, and they taught me how to be a good person.

In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers.

In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away. Meanwhile, the teachers and kids in school kept me   on the straight and narrow, and they taught me how to be a good person. If I stepped out of line, they punished me, and they made me feel bad about myself until I acquired a sense of shame over doing the wrong thing, and a desperate desire to do the right thing.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away. Meanwhile, the teachers and kids in school kept me   on the straight and narrow, and they taught me how to be a good person. If I stepped out of line, they punished me, and they made me feel bad about myself until I acquired a sense of shame over doing the wrong thing, and a desperate desire to do the right thing.

I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away. Meanwhile, the teachers and kids in school kept me   on the straight and narrow, and they taught me how to be a good person. If I stepped out of line, they punished me, and they made me feel bad about myself until I acquired a sense of shame over doing the wrong thing, and a desperate desire to do the right thing.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away.

In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away. Meanwhile, the teachers and kids in school kept me   on the straight and narrow, and they taught me how to be a good person. If I stepped out of line, they punished me, and they made me feel bad about myself until I acquired a sense of shame over doing the wrong thing, and a desperate desire to do the right thing.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away. Meanwhile, the teachers and kids in school kept me   on the straight and narrow, and they taught me how to be a good person. If I stepped out of line, they punished me, and they made me feel bad about myself until I acquired a sense of shame over doing the wrong thing, and a desperate desire to do the right thing.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away.

They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away. Meanwhile, the teachers and kids in school kept me on the straight and narrow, and they taught me how to be a good person. If I stepped out of line, they punished me, and they made me feel bad about myself until I acquired a sense of shame over doing the wrong thing, and a desperate desire to do the right thing.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away. Meanwhile, the teachers and kids in school kept me on the straight and narrow, and they taught me how to be a good person. If I stepped out of line, they punished me, and they made me feel bad about myself until I acquired a sense of shame over doing the wrong thing, and a desperate desire to do the right thing.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away. Meanwhile, the teachers and kids in school kept me on the straight and narrow, and they taught me how to be a good person. If I stepped out of line, they punished me, and they made me feel bad about myself until I acquired a sense of shame over doing the wrong thing, and a desperate desire to do the right thing.

In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away. Meanwhile, the teachers and kids in school kept me on the straight and narrow, and they taught me how to be a good person. If I stepped out of line, they punished me, and they made me feel bad about myself until I acquired a sense of shame over doing the wrong thing, and a desperate desire to do the right thing.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away. Meanwhile, the teachers and kids in school kept me on the straight and narrow, and they taught me how to be a good person. If I stepped out of line, they punished me, and they made me feel bad about myself until I acquired a sense of shame over doing the wrong thing, and a desperate desire to do the right thing.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away. Meanwhile, the teachers and kids in school kept me on the straight and narrow, and they taught me how to be a good person. If I stepped out of line, they punished me, and they made me feel bad about myself until I acquired a sense of shame over doing the wrong thing, and a desperate desire to do the right thing.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away.

For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away. Meanwhile, the teachers and kids in school kept me on the straight and narrow, and they taught me how to be a good person. If I stepped out of line, they punished me, and they made me feel bad about myself until I acquired a sense of shame over doing the wrong thing, and a desperate desire to do the right thing.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away.

Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away. Meanwhile, the teachers and kids in school kept me on the straight and narrow, and they taught me how to be a good person. If I stepped out of line, they punished me, and they made me feel bad about myself until I acquired a sense of shame over doing the wrong thing, and a desperate desire to do the right thing. 

I think it's safe to say if not for school, I might have been a bad kid, and ended up a bad adult, too. Adults who can read or do math are a dime a dozen, but adults who can do the right thing are precious. Our schools owe it to our yout",user,26,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away. Meanwhile, the teachers and kids in school kept me on the straight and narrow, and they taught me how to be a good person. If I stepped out of line, they punished me, and they made me feel bad about myself until I acquired a sense of shame over doing the wrong thing, and a desperate desire to do the right thing. 

I think it's safe to say if not for school, I might have been a bad kid, and ended up a bad adult, too. Adults who can read or do math are a dime a dozen, but adults who can do the right thing are precious.

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away. Meanwhile, the teachers and kids in school kept me on the straight and narrow, and they taught me how to be a good person. If I stepped out of line, they punished me, and they made me feel bad about myself until I acquired a sense of shame over doing the wrong thing, and a desperate desire to do the right thing. 

I think it's safe to say if not for school, I might have been a bad kid, and ended up a bad adult, too. Adults who can read or do math are a dime a dozen, but adults who can do the right thing are precious. Our schools owe it to our youth, and to our society, to teach our children how to be good people, and they should be held accountable if they fail to do so.",api,26,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
