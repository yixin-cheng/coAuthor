I think the steroetypes in general in media I consume that makes me cringe relate to ones that are based on race, gender, and aspects of a person that overall causes harm to people that are associated with such demographics. For example, shows that have characters that are a stereotype of race in general causes me to cringe. The primary reasons for why is because I have first-hand experience of being stereotyped for many reasons, including race, gender, and my sexuality, which stems from the stereotypes that are not only perpetuated in society among people, but also reinforced in popular media such as tv shows and movies. I know others experience similar negative incidents, as stereotypes can often portray them not only in a negative manner, but also make people assume things about them that are not true.

Overall, I would definitely not watch or read something if an offensive portrayal of someone exist in such content.

I think the steroetypes in general in media I consume that makes me cringe relate to ones that are based on race, gender, and aspects of a person that overall causes harm to people that are associated with such demographics. For example, shows that have characters that are a stereotype of race in general causes me to cringe. The primary reasons for why is because I have first-hand experience of being stereotyped for many reasons, including race, gender, and my sexuality, which stems from the stereotypes that are not only perpetuated in society among people, but also reinforced in popular media such as tv shows and movies. I know others experience similar negative incidents, as stereotypes can often portray them not only in a negative manner, but also make people assume things about them that are not true.

Overall, I would definitely not watch or read something if an offensive portrayal of someone exist in such content. I think there are plenty of content and media that I can watch and enjoy that actually portrays its characters in a respectful manner, and                                                                    ",user,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

I think the stereotypes in general in media I consume that makes me cringe relate to ones that are based on race, gender, and aspects of a person that overall causes harm to people that are associated with such demographics. For example, shows that have characters that are a stereotype of race in general causes me to cringe.  Stereotypes on how characters of a particular race act comes to mind, but also stereotypes in literature or art on how people of a specific race look is also things that make me cringe. The primary reasons for why is because I have first-hand experience of being stereotyped for many reasons, including race, gender, and my sexuality, which stems from the stereotypes that are not only perpetuated in society among people, but also reinforced in popular media such as TV shows and movies. I know others experience similar negative incidents, as stereotypes can often portray them not only in a negative manner, but also make people assume things about them that are not true.

I would definitely not watch or read something if an offensive portrayal of someone exist in such content. I think there are plenty of content and media that I can watch and enjoy that actually portrays its characters in a respectful manner, and I shouldn't have to consume or even be exposed to content that is offensive in nature.

Primarily that is whether or not the character is portrayed in a negative manner, and the likelihood that others would associate that character as representative of the group or demographic they are stereotyping.

I think the stereotypes in general in media I consume that makes me cringe relate to ones that are based on race, gender, and aspects of a person that overall causes harm to people that are associated with such demographics. For example, shows that have characters that are a stereotype of race in general causes me to cringe.  Stereotypes on how characters of a particular race act comes to mind, but also stereotypes in literature or art on how people of a specific race look is also things that make me cringe. The primary reasons for why is because I have first-hand experience of being stereotyped for many reasons, including race, gender, and my sexuality, which stems from the stereotypes that are not only perpetuated in society among people, but also reinforced in popular media such as TV shows and movies. I know others experience similar negative incidents, as stereotypes can often portray them not only in a negative manner, but also make people assume things about them that are not true.

I would definitely not watch or read something if an offensive portrayal of someone exist in such content. I think there are plenty of content and media that I can watch and enjoy that actually portrays its characters in a respectful manner, and I shouldn't have to consume or even be exposed to content that is offensive in nature.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

I think the stereotypes in general in media I consume that makes me cringe relate to ones that are based on race, gender, and aspects of a person that overall causes harm to people that are associated with such demographics. For example, shows that have characters that are a stereotype of race in general causes me to cringe.  Stereotypes on how characters of a particular race act comes to mind, but also stereotypes in literature or art on how people of a specific race look is also things that make me cringe. The primary reasons for why is because I have first-hand experience of being stereotyped for many reasons, including race, gender, and my sexuality, which stems from the stereotypes that are not only perpetuated in society among people, but also reinforced in popular media such as TV shows and movies. I know others experience similar negative incidents, as stereotypes can often portray them not only in a negative manner, but also make people assume things about them that are not true.

I would definitely not watch or read something if an offensive portrayal of someone exist in such content. I think there are plenty of content and media that I can watch and enjoy that actually portrays its characters in a respectful manner, and I shouldn't have to consume or even be exposed to content that is offensive in nature. While many shows and movies might still contain stereotypes or tropes related to its characters, their is a fine line to be noted regarded how offensive said character is.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

I think the stereotypes in general in media I consume that makes me cringe relate to ones that are based on race, gender, and aspects of a person that overall causes harm to people that are associated with such demographics. For example, shows that have characters that are a stereotype of race in general causes me to cringe.  Stereotypes on how characters of a particular race act comes to mind, but also stereotypes in literature or art on how people of a specific race look is also things that make me cringe. The primary reasons for why is because I have first-hand experience of being stereotyped for many reasons, including race, gender, and my sexuality, which stems from the stereotypes that are not only perpetuated in society among people, but also reinforced in popular media such as TV shows and movies. I know others experience similar negative incidents, as stereotypes can often portray them not only in a negative manner, but also make people assume things about them that are not true.

I would definitely not watch or read something if an offensive portrayal of someone exist in such content. I think there are plenty of content and media that I can watch and enjoy that actually portrays its characters in a respectful manner, and I shouldn't have to consume or even be exposed to content that is offensive in nature. While many shows and movies might still contain stereotypes or tropes related to its characters, their is a fine line to be noted regarded how offensive said character is. Primarily that is whether or not the character is portrayed in a negative manner, and the likelihood that others would associate that character as representative of the group or demographic they are stereotyping. 

Overall, I am not a fan of stereotypes in media, and I think they are often used to perpetuate negative stereotypes that are not only harmful to people, but also reinforce the beliefs that people hold towards others. Stereotypes are not necessary for stories and different forms of content, they can be avoided.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

I think the stereotypes in general in media I consume that makes me cringe relate to ones that are based on race, gender, and aspects of a person that overall causes harm to people that are associated with such demographics. For example, shows that have characters that are a stereotype of race in general causes me to cringe.  Stereotypes on how characters of a particular race act comes to mind, but also stereotypes in literature or art on how people of a specific race look is also things that make me cringe. The primary reasons for why is because I have first-hand experience of being stereotyped for many reasons, including race, gender, and my sexuality, which stems from the stereotypes that are not only perpetuated in society among people, but also reinforced in popular media such as TV shows and movies. I know others experience similar negative incidents, as stereotypes can often portray them not only in a negative manner, but also make people assume things about them that are not true.

I would definitely not watch or read something if an offensive portrayal of someone exist in such content. I think there are plenty of content and media that I can watch and enjoy that actually portrays its characters in a respectful manner, and I shouldn't have to consume or even be exposed to content that is offensive in nature. While many shows and movies might still contain stereotypes or tropes related to its characters, their is a fine line to be noted regarded how offensive said character is. Primarily that is whether or not the character is portrayed in a negative manner, and the likelihood that others would associate that character as representative of the group or demographic they are stereotyping. 

Overall, I am not a fan of stereotypes in media, and I think they are often used to perpetuate negative stereotypes that are not only harmful to people, but also reinforce the beliefs that people hold towards others. Stereotypes are not necessary for stories and different forms of content, they can be avoided. While it is effortful to create and make characters that defies stereotypes and even popular tropes, I believe it can be done by many. Many content  available today do not portray its characters as nothing more than stereotypes, and I think if that continues to do so such, stereotypes will be less reinforced and held by people in society.",user,15,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The primary reasons for why is because I have first-hand experience of being stereotyped for many reasons, including race, gender, and my sexuality, which stems from the stereotypes that are not only perpetuated in society among people, but also reinforced in popular media such as TV shows and movies. I know others experience similar negative incidents, as stereotypes can often portray them not only in a negative manner, but also make people assume things about them that are not true.

I would definitely not watch or read something if an offensive portrayal of someone exist in such content. I think there are plenty of content and media that I can watch and enjoy that actually portrays its characters in a respectful manner, and I shouldn't have to consume or even be exposed to content that is offensive in nature. While many shows and movies might still contain stereotypes or tropes related to its characters, their is a fine line to be noted regarded how offensive said character is. Primarily that is whether or not the character is portrayed in a negative manner, and the likelihood that others would associate that character as representative of the group or demographic they are stereotyping. 

Overall, I am not a fan of stereotypes in media, and I think they are often used to perpetuate negative stereotypes that are not only harmful to people, but also reinforce the beliefs that people hold towards others. Stereotypes are not necessary for stories and different forms of content, they can be avoided. While it is effortful to create and make characters that defies stereotypes and even popular tropes, I believe it can be done by many. Many content and me available today do not portray its characters as nothing more than stereotypes, and I think if that continues to do so such, stereotypes will be less reinforced and held by people in society.",user,15,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
