There is no other situation in America where people are expected to work so hard, practicing and competing, for so little return.  Yes, they do get a scholarship to attend college, but in terms of their worth to the colleges, this is minimal.  If the colleges don't want to have their players as professionals they should not have set up the sports to resemble professional competitions.

In my opinion, it is only fair to pay the students who are earning so much money for their respective colleges, after all, they are the ones playing and performing in front of large crowds and broadcasting live on TV.  There is no other situation in America where people are expected to work so hard, practicing and competing, for so little return.  Yes, they do get a scholarship to attend college, but in terms of their worth to the colleges, this is minimal.  If the colleges don't want to have their players as professionals they should not have set up the sports to resemble professional competitions.   They have made the rules and policies that could lead to making their athletes into professionals.  The players are expected to act as professionals , train as professions, and put their health on the line, especially in football, like professionals, it is only fair to compensate them as professionals.  In addition, the coaches make ample money, the product is canned enough the schools make plenty of money, the broadcasters make large sums of money from advertising revenues.   To me, it is akin to slave labor to expect so much from someone, in terms of effort, and not to compensate them.

There is no other situation in America where people are expected to work so hard, practicing and competing, for so little return.  Yes, they do get a scholarship to attend college, but in terms of their worth to the colleges, this is minimal.  If the colleges don't want to have their players as professionals they should not have set up the sports to resemble professional competitions.   They have made the rules and policies that could lead to making their athletes into professionals.  The players are expected to act as professionals, train as professions, and put their health on the line, especially in football, like professionals, it is only fair to compensate them as professionals.  In addition, the coaches make ample money, the product is canned enough the schools make plenty of money, the broadcasters make large sums of money from advertising revenues.   To me, it is akin to slave labor to expect so much from someone, in terms of effort, and not to compensate them.   If schools don't want it to happen they will have to come up with a more equitable arrangement, and hopefully that will be the situation.  But until that happens, I am of the opinion that the just thing to do is pay them.",user,13,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
