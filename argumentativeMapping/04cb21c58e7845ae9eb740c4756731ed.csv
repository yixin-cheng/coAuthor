In my opinion, listening to an audiobook is not as good as reading a book the good old fashion way.  n audiobook is like watching a movie inn your head, where reading a book is like directing that movie in your head. In my experience, reading a book helps to enhance the visual pictures my head paints because while reading you are more often than not more focused on reading than just listening. While something is read to me, my mind tends to drift towards thinking about other things. Reading it myself my mind drifts off into what I am reading.

In my opinion, listening to an audiobook is not as good as reading a book the good old fashion way.  n audiobook is like watching a movie inn your head, where reading a book is like directing that movie in your head. In my experience, reading a book helps to enhance the visual pictures my head paints because while reading you are more often than not more focused on reading than just listening. While something is read to me, my mind tends to drift towards thinking about other things. Reading it myself my mind drifts off into what I am reading.

On a more educational point about listening to an audiobook, over reading it yourself, you do not get the same mind sharping skills. What I mean by that is when you are reading, it helps to expand your vocabulary, and improve your reading skills.

In my opinion, listening to an audiobook is not as good as reading a book the good old fashion way.  n audiobook is like watching a movie inn your head, where reading a book is like directing that movie in your head. In my experience, reading a book helps to enhance the visual pictures my head paints because while reading you are more often than not more focused on reading than just listening. While something is read to me, my mind tends to drift towards thinking about other things. Reading it myself my mind drifts off into what I am reading.

On a more educational point about listening to an audiobook, over reading it yourself, you do not get the same mind sharping skills. What I mean by that is when you are reading, it helps to expand your vocabulary, and improve your reading skills. Because of how the sentences are written, while you read them, you can take the time to ask questions like ""who is this person?"", helping to improve your problem solving skills quicker as well. While listening to a book the narrator sometimes talks really fast, so I feel as if you lose the benefits enjoyed from reading a book. There is also a kind of satisfying feeling that comes from flipping the crisp pages of a new book. Even the feel of the pages of a timeless classic.

In my opinion, listening to an audiobook is not as good as reading a book the good old fashion way.  n audiobook is like watching a movie inn your head, where reading a book is like directing that movie in your head. In my experience, reading a book helps to enhance the visual pictures my head paints because while reading you are more often than not more focused on reading than just listening. While something is read to me, my mind tends to drift towards thinking about other things. Reading it myself my mind drifts off into what I am reading.

On a more educational point about listening to an audiobook, over reading it yourself, you do not get the same mind sharping skills. What I mean by that is when you are reading, it helps to expand your vocabulary, and improve your reading skills. Because of how the sentences are written, while you read them, you can take the time to ask questions like ""who is this person?"", helping to improve your problem solving skills quicker as well. While listening to a book the narrator sometimes talks really fast, so I feel as if you lose the benefits enjoyed from reading a book. There is also a kind of satisfying feeling that comes from flipping the crisp pages of a new book. Even the feel of the pages of a timeless classic. Another thing, how nice does an audiobook smell?

In my opinion, listening to an audiobook is not as good as reading a book the good old fashion way.  n audiobook is like watching a movie inn your head, where reading a book is like directing that movie in your head. In my experience, reading a book helps to enhance the visual pictures my head paints because while reading you are more often than not more focused on reading than just listening. While something is read to me, my mind tends to drift towards thinking about other things. Reading it myself my mind drifts off into what I am reading.

On a more educational point about listening to an audiobook, over reading it yourself, you do not get the same mind sharping skills. What I mean by that is when you are reading, it helps to expand your vocabulary, and improve your reading skills. Because of how the sentences are written, while you read them, you can take the time to ask questions like ""who is this person?"", helping to improve your problem solving skills quicker as well.
