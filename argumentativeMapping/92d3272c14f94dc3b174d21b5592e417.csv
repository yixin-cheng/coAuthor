In my opinion, stereotypes such as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypes such as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves.

In my opinion, stereotypes such as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypes such as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves.

So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves.

So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypes such as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people.

So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypes such as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves.

They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypes such as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypes such as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypes such as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypes such as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypes such as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypes such as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypes such as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypes such as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves.

So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it.

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such ster",user,12,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers.

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerablebecause they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern group",user,12,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today.

So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers.

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media.

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves.

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them.

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them. And strangely, while the number of people who complain about stereotypes has increased drastically, the number of stereotypes that are used in modern works hasn't decreased a bit.

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people.

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them. And strangely, while the number of people who complain about stereotypes has increased drastically, the number of stereotypes that are used in modern works hasn't decreased a bit.

So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them. And strangely, while the number of people who complain about stereotypes has increased drastically, the number of stereotypes that are used in modern works hasn't decreased a bit. In fact, I find more stereotypes in modern works, than in works created a long time ago. Thi",user,15,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them. And strangely, while the number of people who complain about stereotypes has increased drastically, the number of stereotypes that are used in modern works hasn't decreased a bit. In fact, I find more stereotypes in modern works, than in works created a long time ago. This suggests to ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people.

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people.

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them. And strangely, while the number of people who complain about stereotypes has increased drastically, the number of stereotypes that are used in modern works hasn't decreased a bit.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves.

So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them. And strangely, while the number of people who complain about stereotypes has increased drastically, the number of stereotypes that are used in modern works hasn't decreased a bit.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them.

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them. And strangely, while the number of people who complain about stereotypes has increased drastically, the number of stereotypes that are used in modern works hasn't decreased a bit. In fact, I find more stereotypes in modern works, than in works created a long time ago. This suggests to me, that the problem isn't so much stereotypes, or ignorance.

These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them. And strangely, while the number of people who complain about stereotypes has increased drastically, the number of stereotypes that are used in modern works hasn't decreased a bit. In fact, I find more stereotypes in modern works, than in works created a long time ago. This suggests to me, that the problem isn't so much stereotypes, or ignorance. The actual problem is that modern writers are just don't care enough to do better.",user,16,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves.

For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them. And strangely, while the number of people who complain about stereotypes has increased drastically, the number of stereotypes that are used in modern works hasn't decreased a bit. In fact, I find more stereotypes in modern works, than in works created a long time ago. This suggests to me, that the problem isn't so much stereotypes, or ignorance.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them. And strangely, while the number of people who complain about stereotypes has increased drastically, the number of stereotypes that are used in modern works hasn't decreased a bit.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them. And strangely, while the number of people who complain about stereotypes has increased drastically, the number of stereotypes that are used in modern works hasn't decreased a bit. In fact, I find more stereotypes in modern works, than in works created a long time ago. This suggests to me, that the problem isn't so much stereotypes, or ignorance.

So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them. And strangely, while the number of people who complain about stereotypes has increased drastically, the number of stereotypes that are used in modern works hasn't decreased a bit. In fact, I find more stereotypes in modern works, than in works created a long time ago. This suggests to me, that the problem isn't so much stereotypes, or ignorance.

These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them. And strangely, while the number of people who complain about stereotypes has increased drastically, the number of stereotypes that are used in modern works hasn't decreased a bit. In fact, I find more stereotypes in modern works, than in works created a long time ago. This suggests to me, that the problem isn't so much stereotypes, or ignorance. The actual problem is that modern writers are just too untalented, and lazy, to do better.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves.

So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them. And strangely, while the number of people who complain about stereotypes has increased drastically, the number of stereotypes that are used in modern works hasn't decreased a bit. In fact, I find more stereotypes in modern works, than in works created a long time ago. This suggests to me, that the problem isn't so much stereotypes, or ignorance. The actual problem is that modern writers are just too untalented, and lazy, to do better.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them. And strangely, while the number of people who complain about stereotypes has increased drastically, the number of stereotypes that are used in modern works hasn't decreased a bit. In fact, I find more stereotypes in modern works, than in works created a long time ago. This suggests to me, that the problem isn't so much stereotypes, or ignorance. The actual problem is that modern writers are just too untalented, and lazy, to do better.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them. And strangely, while the number of people who complain about stereotypes has increased drastically, the number of stereotypes that are used in modern works hasn't decreased a bit. In fact, I find more stereotypes in modern works, than in works created a long time ago. This suggests to me, that the problem isn't so much stereotypes, or ignorance.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them. And strangely, while the number of people who complain about stereotypes has increased drastically, the number of stereotypes that are used in modern works hasn't decreased a bit. In fact, I find more stereotypes in modern works, than in works created a long time ago. This suggests to me, that the problem isn't so much stereotypes, or ignorance. The actual problem is that modern writers are just too untalented, and lazy, to do better.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them. And strangely, while the number of people who complain about stereotypes has increased drastically, the number of stereotypes that are used in modern works hasn't decreased a bit. In fact, I find more stereotypes in modern works, than in works created a long time ago. This suggests to me, that the problem isn't so much stereotypes, or ignorance. The actual problem is that modern writers are just too untalented, and lazy, to do better.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them. And strangely, while the number of people who complain about stereotypes has increased drastically, the number of stereotypes that are used in modern works hasn't decreased a bit.

So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them. And strangely, while the number of people who complain about stereotypes has increased drastically, the number of stereotypes that are used in modern works hasn't decreased a bit. In fact, I find more stereotypes in modern works, than in works created a long time ago. This suggests to me, that the problem isn't so much stereotypes, or ignorance.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.
