It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days.

This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days.

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown.

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows? I think this is a stereotype that could cause some damage if it is not removed soon, especially if these shows are watched by young and impressionable girls.

This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows? I think this is a stereotype that could cause some damage if it is not removed soon, especially if these shows are watched by young and impressionable girls.

This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows? I think this is a stereotype that could cause some damage if it is not removed soon, especially if these shows are watched by young and impressionable girls.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows? I think this is a stereotype that could cause some damage if it is not removed soon, especially if these shows are watched by young and impressionable girls.

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows?

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows? I think this is a stereotype that could cause some damage if it is not removed soon, especially if these shows are watched by young and impressionable girls.

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows? I think this is a stereotype that could cause some damage if it is not removed soon, especially if these shows are watched by young and impressionable girls.

If I had young children I certainly would not want them watching shows that give off the impression that women should stay home and care for the family. I would want ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows? I think this is a stereotype that could cause some damage if it is not removed soon, especially if these shows are watched by young and impressionable girls.

If I had young children I certainly would not want them watching shows that give off the impression that women should stay home and care for the family. I would want my children, bot",user,22,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows? I think this is a stereotype that could cause some damage if it is not removed soon, especially if these shows are watched by young and impressionable girls.

If I had young children I certainly would not want them watching shows that give off the impression that women should stay home and care for the family. I would want my children, both boys and gir",user,22,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday.

This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows? I think this is a stereotype that could cause some damage if it is not removed soon, especially if these shows are watched by young and impressionable girls.

If I had young children I certainly would not want them watching shows that give off the impression that women should stay home and care for the family. I would want my children, both boys and girls, to realize that women can do whatever m",user,22,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown.

This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows? I think this is a stereotype that could cause some damage if it is not removed soon, especially if these shows are watched by young and impressionable girls.

If I had young children I certainly would not want them watching shows that give off the impression that women should stay home and care for the family. I would want my children, both boys and girls, to realize that women can do whatever men can do, and they can do it j",user,22,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows? I think this is a stereotype that could cause some damage if it is not removed soon, especially if these shows are watched by young and impressionable girls.

If I had young children I certainly would not want them watching shows that give off the impression that women should stay home and care for the family.

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows? I think this is a stereotype that could cause some damage if it is not removed soon, especially if these shows are watched by young and impressionable girls.

If I had young children I certainly would not want them watching shows that give off the impression that women should stay home and care for the family. I would want my children, both boys and girls, to realize that women can do whatever men can do, and they can do it just as well.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows?

This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows? I think this is a stereotype that could cause some damage if it is not removed soon, especially if these shows are watched by young and impressionable girls.

If I had young children I certainly would not want them watching shows that give off the impression that women should stay home and care for the family. I would want my children, both boys and girls, to realize that women can do whatever men can do, and they can do it just as well.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows? I think this is a stereotype that could cause some damage if it is not removed soon, especially if these shows are watched by young and impressionable girls.

If I had young children I certainly would not want them watching shows that give off the impression that women should stay home and care for the family. I would want my children, both boys and girls, to realize that women can do whatever men can do, and they can do it just as well.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows? I think this is a stereotype that could cause some damage if it is not removed soon, especially if these shows are watched by young and impressionable girls.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday.

This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows? I think this is a stereotype that could cause some damage if it is not removed soon, especially if these shows are watched by young and impressionable girls.

If I had young children I certainly would not want them watching shows that give off the impression that women should stay home and care for the family. I would want my children, both boys and girls, to realize that women can do whatever men can do, and they can do it just as well.

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home.

Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday.

I would want my children, both boys and girls, to realize that women can do whatever men can do, and they can do it just as well.

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows?

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday.

---

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows? I think this is a stereotype that could cause some damage if it is not removed soon, especially if these shows are watched by young and impressionable girls.

If I had young children I certainly would not want them watching shows that give off the impression that women should stay home and care for the family. I would want my children, both boys and girls, to realize that women can do whatever men can do, and they can do it just as well. I want them to know women are capable and I do not want the stereotype put in their heads that women are not meant to work outside the home. We need to show young kids that women can do whatever they want, and that they can be whatever the equivalent of a man is. It is definitely time to get rid of the stereotyp ",user,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I think this is a stereotype that could cause some damage if it is not removed soon, especially if these shows are watched by young and impressionable girls.

If I had young children I certainly would not want them watching shows that give off the impression that women should stay home and care for the family. I would want my children, both boys and girls, to realize that women can do whatever men can do, and they can do it just as well. I want them to know women are capable and I do not want the stereotype put in their heads that women are not meant to work outside the home. We need to show young kids that women can do whatever they want, and that they can be whatever the equivalent of a man is.

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows? I think this is a stereotype that could cause some damage if it is not removed soon, especially if these shows are watched by young and impressionable girls.

If I had young children I certainly would not want them watching shows that give off the impression that women should stay home and care for the family. I would want my children, both boys and girls, to realize that women can do whatever men can do, and they can do it just as well.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows? I think this is a stereotype that could cause some damage if it is not removed soon, especially if these shows are watched by young and impressionable girls.

If I had young children I certainly would not want them watching shows that give off the impression that women should stay home and care for the family. I would want my children, both boys and girls, to realize that women can do whatever men can do, and they can do it just as well. I want them to know women are capable and I do not want the stereotype put in their heads that women are not meant to work outside the home. We need to show young kids that women can do whatever they want, and that they can be whatever the equivalent of a man is.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows? I think this is a stereotype that could cause some damage if it is not removed soon, especially if these shows are watched by young and impressionable girls.

If I had young children I certainly would not want them watching shows that give off the impression that women should stay home and care for the family. I would want my children, both boys and girls, to realize that women can do whatever men can do, and they can do it just as well.

If I had young children I certainly would not want them watching shows that give off the impression that women should stay home and care for the family. I would want my children, both boys and girls, to realize that women can do whatever men can do, and they can do it just as well. I want them to know women are capable and I do not want the stereotype put in their heads that women are not meant to work outside the home. We need to show young kids that women can do whatever they want, and that they can be whatever the equivalent of a man is. It is definitely time to get rid of the stereotype that women belong inside the home. It is 2020, not 1940, let's move on!",user,26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
