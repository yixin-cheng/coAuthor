Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, the main reason why extreme sports can be defined as a sport is for the same reason any other sport is. It is exciting and gives the participants a sense of amusement. If there is no thrill or excitement, it might be considered a life-threatening activity rather than a sport. Climbing for fun, without the fun, is hanging wires, excavating, or doing any other monotonous job. 

Extreme outdoor pursuit activities such as mountain climbing and caving are the epitome of this. The difficulties of the climb, whether rock-climbing or mountain-climbing can make it even more thrilling and exciting. Exactly like other sports, the underlying reason why people participate in these activities is to have fun. All sports have risk. Some people just prefer to increase the risk difficulty. 
The adrenaline (fear/anger/happiness) rush experienced by the climber or caver makes it an attractive and highly rewarding activity
. Many of these sports also provide a sense of accomplishment, due mainly to the dangers faced in combination to the extreme athleticism required. 
The extreme thrills and extreme dangers of outdoor activities are what make them both exciting and rewarding.
 If you take away the thrills and dangers, these sports would lose their reason to exist. 
Sports are competitive
. It is no question that almost all types of sports, including extreme outdoor pursuit athletes, are meant to compete with others. The thrill and adrenaline rush of winning, or the agony and suffering of defeat endured by competitors, leads to a sense of newfound perseverance and strength.

In my opinion, the main reason why extreme sports can be defined as a sport is for the same reason any other sport is. It is exciting and gives the participants a sense of amusement. If there is no thrill or excitement, it might be considered a life-threatening activity rather than a sport. Climbing for fun, without the fun, is hanging wires, excavating, or doing any other monotonous job. 

Extreme outdoor pursuit activities such as mountain climbing and caving are the epitome of this. The difficulties of the climb, whether rock-climbing or mountain-climbing can make it even more thrilling and exciting. Exactly like other sports, the underlying reason why people participate in these activities is to have fun. All sports have risk. Some people just prefer to increase the risk difficulty.

The extreme thrills and extreme dangers of outdoor activities are what make them both exciting and rewarding.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, the main reason why extreme sports can be defined as a sport is for the same reason any other sport is. It is exciting and gives the participants a sense of amusement. If there is no thrill or excitement, it might be considered a life-threatening activity rather than a sport. Climbing for fun, without the fun, is hanging wires, excavating, or doing any other monotonous job. 

Extreme outdoor pursuit activities such as mountain climbing and caving are the epitome of this. The difficulties of the climb, whether rock-climbing or mountain-climbing, or otherwise,  can make it even more thrilling and exciting. Exactly like other sports, the underlying reason why people participate in these activities is to have fun and challenge themselves. 

The adrenaline (fear/anger/happiness) rush experienced by the climber or caver makes it an attractive and highly rewarding activity. Many of these extreme sports also provide a sense of accomplishment, due mainly to the dangers faced in combination to the athleticism required.

All sports have risk. Some people just prefer to increase the risk difficulty. he extreme thrills and extreme dangers of outdoor activities are what make them both exciting and rewarding.
 If you take away the thrills and dangers, these sports would lose their reason to exist. 
Sports are competitive
. It is no question that almost all types of sports, including extreme outdoor pursuit athletes, are meant to compete with others. The thrill and adrenaline rush of winning, or the agony and suffering of defeat endured by competitors, leads to a sense of newfound perseverance and strength. 
Participating in these sports allows players to experience new feelings of excitement.
 This makes the sport addictive and people want to perform better and better, or push the boundaries further and further.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

If there is no thrill or excitement, it might be considered a life-threatening activity rather than a sport. Climbing for fun, without the fun, is hanging wires, excavating, or doing any other monotonous job. 

Extreme outdoor pursuit activities such as mountain climbing and caving are the epitome of this. The difficulties of the climb, whether rock-climbing or mountain-climbing, or otherwise,  can make it even more thrilling and exciting.

 If you take away the thrills and dangers, these sports would lose their reason to exist.
