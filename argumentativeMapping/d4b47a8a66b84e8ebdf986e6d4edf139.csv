In my opinion, I disagree with the author's point that paying college athletes would somehow ruin college sports. I feel if the athletes generate so much attention and publicity that they are benefiting the bottom line of a university, then it's only fair that they should get a share of that benefit. 
I also think that paying college athletes would not necessarily cause a bidding war.
 There could be alternative ways of compensating them that don't involve unequal payments that would allow them to bid on the athletes in the first place. 
I disagree with the author's point that paying college athletes would distort the economics of college sports. because, as I previously stated, they could develop a system that works fairly and treats the athletes equally. It may change the economics slightly by improving a system but this is not a bad thing. The athletes work hard and deserve their share of pay. pa
