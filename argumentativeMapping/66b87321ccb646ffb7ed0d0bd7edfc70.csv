Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

It is not just wrong its evil to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we should be focusing on helping people. We used animal's as food, clothing and occasionally entertainment, they are ours to use as we wish.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, the people who think animals are more important then people are not following the word of our lord. He said that man was to rule over all animals and use them as man sees fit. It is not just wrong its evil to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we should be focusing on helping people. We used animal's as food, clothing and occasionally entertainment, they are ours to use as we wish. So we should not worry about them when millions of babies are being murdered every few months or sold for cloning. We have people in America who are starving, but working full time but have to give all their money to the government. We need to fix that before fixing nature and animals. Once we get rid of all the trouble makers and restart the country, then maybe we will talk about animals being treated a little better.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, the people who think animals are more important then people are not following the word of our lord. He said that man was to rule over all animals and use them as man sees fit. It is not just wrong its evil to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we should be focusing on helping people. We used animal's as food, clothing and occasionally entertainment, they are ours to use as we wish. So we should not worry about them when millions of babies are being murdered every few months or sold for cloning. We have people in America who are starving, but working full time but have to give all their money to the government. We need to fix that before fixing nature and animals. Once we get rid of all the trouble makers and restart the country, then maybe we will talk about animals being treated a little better.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, the people who think animals are more important then people are not following the word of our lord. He said that man was to rule over all animals and use them as man sees fit. It is not just wrong its evil to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we should be focusing on helping people. We used animal's as food, clothing and occasionally entertainment, they are ours to use as we wish. So we should not worry about them when millions of babies are being murdered every few months or sold for cloning. We have people in America who are starving, but working full time but have to give all their money to the government. We need to fix that before fixing nature and animals. Once we get rid of all the trouble makers and restart the country, then maybe we will talk about animals being treated a little better.  
The animals just need to stand around and eat sometimes, they dont have to deal with the Democrats and illegal aliens.  If the animals had our problems then maybe I would feel bad for them but they just eat up our natural resources and they act like the patriots are not being systematically erased from Twitter.",user,15,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, the people who think animals are more important then people are not following the word of our lord. He said that man was to rule over all animals and use them as man sees fit. It is not just wrong its evil to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we should be focusing on helping people. We used animal's as food, clothing and occasionally entertainment, they are ours to use as we wish. So we should not worry about them when millions of babies are being murdered every few months or sold for cloning. We have people in America who are starving, but working full time but have to give all their money to the government. We need to fix that before fixing nature and animals. Once we get rid of all the trouble makers and restart the country, then maybe we will talk about animals being treated a little better.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, the people who think animals are more important then people are not following the word of our lord. He said that man was to rule over all animals and use them as man sees fit. It is not just wrong its evil to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we should be focusing on helping people. We used animal's as food, clothing and occasionally entertainment, they are ours to use as we wish. So we should not worry about them when millions of babies are being murdered every few months or sold for cloning. We have people in America who are starving, but working full time but have to give all their money to the government. We need to fix that before fixing nature and animals. Once we get rid of all the trouble makers and restart the country, then maybe we will talk about animals being treated a little better.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, the people who think animals are more important then people are not following the word of our lord. He said that man was to rule over all animals and use them as man sees fit. It is not just wrong its evil to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we should be focusing on helping people. We used animal's as food, clothing and occasionally entertainment, they are ours to use as we wish. So we should not worry about them when millions of babies are being murdered every few months or sold for cloning. We have people in America who are starving, but working full time but have to give all their money to the government. We need to fix that before fixing nature and animals.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, the people who think animals are more important then people are not following the word of our lord. He said that man was to rule over all animals and use them as man sees fit. It is not just wrong its evil to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we should be focusing on helping people. We used animal's as food, clothing and occasionally entertainment, they are ours to use as we wish. So we should not worry about them when millions of babies are being murdered every few months or sold for cloning. We have people in America who are starving, but working full time but have to give all their money to the government. We need to fix that before fixing nature and animals. Once we get rid of all the trouble makers and restart the country, then maybe we will talk about animals being treated a little better.  
The animals just need to stand around and eat sometimes, they dont have to deal with the Democrats and illegal aliens.  If the animals had our problems then maybe I would feel bad for them but they just eat up our natural resources and they act like there's not such thing as Twitter and Facebook and how patriots are not being systematically erased from existence.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, the people who think animals are more important then people are not following the word of our lord. He said that man was to rule over all animals and use them as man sees fit. It is not just wrong its evil to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we should be focusing on helping people. We used animal's as food, clothing and occasionally entertainment, they are ours to use as we wish. So we should not worry about them when millions of babies are being murdered every few months or sold for cloning. We have people in America who are starving, but working full time but have to give all their money to the government. We need to fix that before fixing nature and animals. Once we get rid of all the trouble makers and restart the country, then maybe we will talk about animals being treated a little better.  
The animals just need to stand around and eat sometimes, they dont have to deal with the Democrats and illegal aliens.  If the animals had our problems then maybe I would feel bad for them but they just eat up our natural resources and they act like there's not such thing as Twitter and Facebook and how patriots are not being systematically erased from existence.

In my opinion, the people who think animals are more important then people are not following the word of our lord. He said that man was to rule over all animals and use them as man sees fit.

In my opinion, the people who think animals are more important then people are not following the word of our lord. He said that man was to rule over all animals and use them as man sees fit. It is not just wrong its evil to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we should be focusing on helping people. We used animal's as food, clothing and occasionally entertainment, they are ours to use as we wish. So we should not worry about them when millions of babies are being murdered every few months or sold for cloning. We have people in America who are starving, but working full time but have to give all their money to the government. We need to fix that before fixing nature and animals. Once we get rid of all the trouble makers and restart the country, then maybe we will talk about animals being treated a little better.  
The animals just need to stand around and eat sometimes, they dont have to deal with the Democrats and illegal aliens.  If the animals had our problems then maybe I would feel bad for them but they just eat up our natural resources and they act like there's not such thing as Twitter and Facebook and how patriots are not being systematically erased from existence.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, the people who think animals are more important then people are not following the word of our lord. He said that man was to rule over all animals and use them as man sees fit. It is not just wrong its evil to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we should be focusing on helping people. We used animal's as food, clothing and occasionally entertainment, they are ours to use as we wish. So we should not worry about them when millions of babies are being murdered every few months or sold for cloning. We have people in America who are starving, but working full time but have to give all their money to the government. We need to fix that before fixing nature and animals. Once we get rid of all the trouble makers and restart the country, then maybe we will talk about animals being treated a little better.  
The animals just need to stand around and eat sometimes, they dont have to deal with the Democrats and illegal aliens.  If the animals had our problems then maybe I would feel bad for them but they just eat up our natural resources and they act like there's not such thing as Twitter and Facebook and how patriots are not being systematically erased from existence.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, the people who think animals are more important then people are not following the word of our lord. He said that man was to rule over all animals and use them as man sees fit. It is not just wrong its evil to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we should be focusing on helping people. We used animal's as food, clothing and occasionally entertainment, they are ours to use as we wish. So we should not worry about them when millions of babies are being murdered every few months or sold for cloning. We have people in America who are starving, but working full time but have to give all their money to the government. We need to fix that before fixing nature and animals.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, the people who think animals are more important then people are not following the word of our lord. He said that man was to rule over all animals and use them as man sees fit. It is not just wrong its evil to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we should be focusing on helping people. We used animal's as food, clothing and occasionally entertainment, they are ours to use as we wish. So we should not worry about them when millions of babies are being murdered every few months or sold for cloning. We have people in America who are starving, but working full time but have to give all their money to the government. We need to fix that before fixing nature and animals. Once we get rid of all the trouble makers and restart the country, then maybe we will talk about animals being treated a little better.  
The animals just need to stand around and eat sometimes, they dont have to deal with the Democrats and illegal aliens.  If the animals had our problems then maybe I would feel bad for them but they just eat up our natural resources and they act like there's not such thing as Twitter and Facebook and how patriots are not being systematically erased from existence.

It is not just wrong its evil to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we should be focusing on helping people. We used animal's as food, clothing and occasionally entertainment, they are ours to use as we wish. So we should not worry about them when millions of babies are being murdered every few months or sold for cloning. We have people in America who are starving, but working full time but have to give all their money to the government. We need to fix that before fixing nature and animals. Once we get rid of all the trouble makers and restart the country, then maybe we will talk about animals being treated a little better.  
The animals just need to stand around and eat sometimes, they dont have to deal with the Democrats and illegal aliens.  If the animals had our problems then maybe I would feel bad for them but they just eat up our natural resources and they act like there's not such thing as Twitter and Facebook and how patriots are not being systematically erased from existence.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, the people who think animals are more important then people are not following the word of our lord. He said that man was to rule over all animals and use them as man sees fit. It is not just wrong its evil to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we should be focusing on helping people. We used animal's as food, clothing and occasionally entertainment, they are ours to use as we wish. So we should not worry about them when millions of babies are being murdered every few months or sold for cloning. We have people in America who are starving, but working full time but have to give all their money to the government. We need to fix that before fixing nature and animals. Once we get rid of all the trouble makers and restart the country, then maybe we will talk about animals being treated a little better.  
The animals just need to stand around and eat sometimes, they dont have to deal with the Democrats and illegal aliens.  If the animals had our problems then maybe I would feel bad for them but they just eat up our natural resources and they act like there's not such thing as Twitter and Facebook and how patriots are not being systematically erased from existence.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, the people who think animals are more important then people are not following the word of our lord. He said that man was to rule over all animals and use them as man sees fit. It is not just wrong its evil to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we should be focusing on helping people. We used animal's as food, clothing and occasionally entertainment, they are ours to use as we wish. So we should not worry about them when millions of babies are being murdered every few months or sold for cloning. We have people in America who are starving, but working full time but have to give all their money to the government. We need to fix that before fixing nature and animals. Once we get rid of all the trouble makers and restart the country, then maybe we will talk about animals being treated a little better.  
The animals just need to stand around and eat sometimes, they dont have to deal with the Democrats and illegal aliens.  If the animals had our problems then maybe I would feel bad for them but they just eat up our natural resources and they act like there's not such thing as Twitter and Facebook and how patriots are not being systematically erased from existence.

It is not just wrong its evil to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we should be focusing on helping people. We used animal's as food, clothing and occasionally entertainment, they are ours to use as we wish. So we should not worry about them when millions of babies are being murdered every few months or sold for cloning. We have people in America who are starving, but working full time but have to give all their money to the government. We need to fix that before fixing nature and animals. Once we get rid of all the trouble makers and restart the country, then maybe we will talk about animals being treated a little better.

It is not just wrong its evil to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we should be focusing on helping people. We used animal's as food, clothing and occasionally entertainment, they are ours to use as we wish.

We have people in America who are starving, but working full time but have to give all their money to the government. We need to fix that before fixing nature and animals.

In my opinion, the people who think animals are more important then people are not following the word of our lord. He said that man was to rule over all animals and use them as man sees fit. It is not just wrong its evil to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we should be focusing on helping people. We used animal's as food, clothing and occasionally entertainment, they are ours to use as we wish. So we should not worry about them when millions of babies are being murdered every few months or sold for cloning. We have people in America who are starving, but working full time but have to give all their money to the government. We need to fix that before fixing nature and animals. Once we get rid of all the trouble makers and restart the country, then maybe we will talk about animals being treated a little better.  
The animals just need to stand around and eat sometimes, they dont have to deal with the Democrats and illegal aliens.  If the animals had our problems then maybe I would feel bad for them but they just eat up our natural resources and they act like there's not such thing as Twitter and Facebook and how patriots are not being systematically erased from existence. 
So no, I do not think animals should get any extra treatment until humans get their act together and get back to no",user,16,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.
