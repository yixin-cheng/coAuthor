One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism. 

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism. 

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry.

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line.

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism. 

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism. 

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm.

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism. 

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line.

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism. 

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism. 

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line.

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism. 

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line. 

There's so many more examples that I could use but I know a lot more people are aware of these stereotypical caricatures these days and Asians are definitely starting to break the mold which is a great thing. Asian ",user,12,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line. 

There's so many more examples that I could use but I know a lot more people are aware of these stereotypical caricatures these days and Asians are definitely starting to break the mold which is a great thing. People arAsians are humans ",user,12,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line. 

There's so many more examples that I could use but I know a lot more people are aware of these stereotypical caricatures these days and Asians are definitely starting to break the mold which is a great thing. People are giving Asians muAsians are humans ",user,12,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line. 

There's so many more examples that I could use but I know a lot more people are aware of these stereotypical caricatures these days and Asians are definitely starting to break the mold which is a great thing.

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line. 

There's so many more examples that I could use but I know a lot more people are aware of these stereotypical caricatures these days and Asians are definitely starting to break the mold which is a great thing.

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line. 

There's so many more examples that I could use but I know a lot more people are aware of these stereotypical caricatures these days and Asians are definitely starting to break the mold which is a great thing. People are giving Asians much more wider and realistic roles to play in movies and shows now which makes me happy to see like Riverdale for instance, or CrazyAsians are humans ",user,12,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line.

One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line. 

There's so many more examples that I could use but I know a lot more people are aware of these stereotypical caricatures these days and Asians are definitely starting to break the mold which is a great thing. People are giving Asians much more wider and realistic roles to play in movies and shows now which makes me happy to see like Riverdale for instance, or Crazy Rich Asians.

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line. 

There's so many more examples that I could use but I know a lot more people are aware of these stereotypical caricatures these days and Asians are definitely starting to break the mold which is a great thing. People are giving Asians much more wider and realistic roles to play in movies and shows now which makes me happy to see like Riverdale for instance, or Crazy Rich Asians.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm.

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line. 

There's so many more examples that I could use but I know a lot more people are aware of these stereotypical caricatures these days and Asians are definitely starting to break the mold which is a great thing. People are giving Asians much more wider and realistic roles to play in movies and shows now which makes me happy to see like Riverdale for instance, or Crazy Rich Asians.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line. 

There's so many more examples that I could use but I know a lot more people are aware of these stereotypical caricatures these days and Asians are definitely starting to break the mold which is a great thing. People are giving Asians much more wider and realistic roles to play in movies and shows now which makes me happy to see like Riverdale for instance, or Crazy Rich Asians.

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line. 

There's so many more examples that I could use but I know a lot more people are aware of these stereotypical caricatures these days and Asians are definitely starting to break the mold which is a great thing. People are giving Asians much more wider and realistic roles to play in movies and shows now which makes me happy to see like Riverdale for instance, or Crazy Rich Asians.

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line. 

There's so many more examples that I could use but I know a lot more people are aware of these stereotypical caricatures these days and Asians are definitely starting to break the mold which is a great thing. People are giving Asians much more wider and realistic roles to play in movies and shows now which makes me happy to see like Riverdale for instance, or Crazy Rich Asians.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line. 

There's so many more examples that I could use but I know a lot more people are aware of these stereotypical caricatures these days and Asians are definitely starting to break the mold which is a great thing. People are giving Asians much more wider and realistic roles to play in movies and shows now which makes me happy to see like Riverdale for instance, or Crazy Rich Asians. Asians are humans just like anyone else and just like anyone else Asians have their geeky/nerdy types, jock types, popular ditzy types, ladies' man type and everything from one end of the spectrum to the other.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm.

One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line. 

There's so many more examples that I could use but I know a lot more people are aware of these stereotypical caricatures these days and Asians are definitely starting to break the mold which is a great thing. People are giving Asians much more wider and realistic roles to play in movies and shows now which makes me happy to see like Riverdale for instance, or Crazy Rich Asians.

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line. 

There's so many more examples that I could use but I know a lot more people are aware of these stereotypical caricatures these days and Asians are definitely starting to break the mold which is a great thing.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line. 

There's so many more examples that I could use but I know a lot more people are aware of these stereotypical caricatures these days and Asians are definitely starting to break the mold which is a great thing. People are giving Asians much more wider and realistic roles to play in movies and shows now which makes me happy to see like Riverdale for instance, or Crazy Rich Asians.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line. 

There's so many more examples that I could use but I know a lot more people are aware of these stereotypical caricatures these days and Asians are definitely starting to break the mold which is a great thing.

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line. 

There's so many more examples that I could use but I know a lot more people are aware of these stereotypical caricatures these days and Asians are definitely starting to break the mold which is a great thing. People are giving Asians much more wider and realistic roles to play in movies and shows now which makes me happy to see like Riverdale for instance, or Crazy Rich Asians. Asians are humans just like anyone else and just like anyone else Asians have their geeky/nerdy types, jock types, popular ditzy types, ladies' man type and everything from one end of the spectrum to the other.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s.

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line. 

There's so many more examples that I could use but I know a lot more people are aware of these stereotypical caricatures these days and Asians are definitely starting to break the mold which is a great thing. People are giving Asians much more wider and realistic roles to play in movies and shows now which makes me happy to see like Riverdale for instance, or Crazy Rich Asians. Asians are humans just like anyone else and just like anyone else Asians have their geeky/nerdy types, jock types, popular ditzy types, ladies' man type and everything from one end of the spectrum to the other.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line. 

There's so many more examples that I could use but I know a lot more people are aware of these stereotypical caricatures these days and Asians are definitely starting to break the mold which is a great thing.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line. 

There's so many more examples that I could use but I know a lot more people are aware of these stereotypical caricatures these days and Asians are definitely starting to break the mold which is a great thing. People are giving Asians much more wider and realistic roles to play in movies and shows now which makes me happy to see like Riverdale for instance, or Crazy Rich Asians.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line. 

There's so many more examples that I could use but I know a lot more people are aware of these stereotypical caricatures these days and Asians are definitely starting to break the mold which is a great thing. People are giving Asians much more wider and realistic roles to play in movies and shows now which makes me happy to see like Riverdale for instance, or Crazy Rich Asians. Asians are humans just like anyone else and just like anyone else Asians have their geeky/nerdy types, jock types, popular ditzy types, ladies' man type and everything from one end of the spectrum to the other.
