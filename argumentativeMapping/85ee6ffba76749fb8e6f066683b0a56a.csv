In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, what you should learn in school is how to think.  It should broaden your horizons and show you there is a bigger world. 
TAnothermimportant thing  have learned is that with literacy you can learn anything.
  That's not solely literacy from written matter either.   It includes the ability to comprehend and interpret spoken or written information.   

Critical thinking is an important tool in going forward in life.  Everything cannot be true.  You have to learn to think things through logically.   The more you practice critical thinking, the clearer your brain will become.

School needs to prepare people to be citizens of a democracy.  Without citizens who can think, think critically and learn a democracy will not flourish but will die.  here is a difference between being literate and educated.
   A person can read and write but may not have the intellectual ability to understand or draw correct inference from that information.  This is were school steps in.

In the past, rote learning and memorization were the rule.  In some countries this type of education still flourishes.  It can produce very high test scores.  However, that has been slowly changing as educators and businesses have found that what they need are people who can apply what they have learned to novel situations, in other words, generalize.  What is needed is the ability to think, not just memorize.

Instituting this type of education has been difficult for schools as many parents are not fans.  They don't want to see their children not get good grades on standardized tests.  School administrators face backlash from governmental bodies when standardized test scores are low as well.  This is a big issue for educators.
