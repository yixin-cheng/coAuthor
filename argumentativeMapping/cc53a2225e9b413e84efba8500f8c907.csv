In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you.

With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So i",user,14,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. Ho",user,15,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things.

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book.

But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else.

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else.

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you.

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else.

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books. Pictures and Illustrations are also absent from audiobooks, because it is only the voice of the narrator. The narrator, in w",user,22,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books.

But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else.

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up.

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up.

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else.

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book.

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things.

It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books. Pictures and Illustrations are also absent from audiobooks, because it is only the voice of the narrator. The narrator, in which you mostly do not also have the choice of. I hate it when the narrator doesn't sound how you would imagine the characters to sound like in your mind, the same way as with the books turned into movies where the actors don't look like their description or someone else that you would've imagined for the role.

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books. Pictures and Illustrations are also absent from audiobooks, because it is only the voice of the narrator. The narrator, in which you mostly do not also have the choice of. I hate it when the narrator doesn't sound how you would imagine the characters to sound like in your mind, the same way as with the books turned into movies where the actors don't look like their description or someone else that you would've imagined for the role.

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books. Pictures and Illustrations are also absent from audiobooks, because it is only the voice of the narrator. The narrator, in which you mostly do not also have the choice of. I hate it when the narrator doesn't sound how you would imagine the characters to sound like in your mind, the same way as with the books turned into movies where the actors don't look like their description or someone else that you would've imagined for the role.

So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books. Pictures and Illustrations are also absent from audiobooks, because it is only the voice of the narrator. The narrator, in which you mostly do not also have the choice of. I hate it when the narrator doesn't sound how you would imagine the characters to sound like in your mind, the same way as with the books turned into movies where the actors don't look like their description or someone else that you would've imagined for the role.

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you.

So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books. Pictures and Illustrations are also absent from audiobooks, because it is only the voice of the narrator. The narrator, in which you mostly do not also have the choice of. I hate it when the narrator doesn't sound how you would imagine the characters to sound like in your mind, the same way as with the books turned into movies where the actors don't look like their description or someone else that you would've imagined for the role.

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you.

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books. Pictures and Illustrations are also absent from audiobooks, because it is only the voice of the narrator. The narrator, in which you mostly do not also have the choice of. I hate it when the narrator doesn't sound how you would imagine the characters to sound like in your mind, the same way as with the books turned into movies where the actors don't look like their description or someone else that you would've imagined for the role.

With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books. Pictures and Illustrations are also absent from audiobooks, because it is only the voice of the narrator. The narrator, in which you mostly do not also have the choice of. I hate it when the narrator doesn't sound how you would imagine the characters to sound like in your mind, the same way as with the books turned into movies where the actors don't look like their description or someone else that you would've imagined for the role.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books. Pictures and Illustrations are also absent from audiobooks, because it is only the voice of the narrator. The narrator, in which you mostly do not also have the choice of. I hate it when the narrator doesn't sound how you would imagine the characters to sound like in your mind, the same way as with the books turned into movies where the actors don't look like their description or someone else that you would've imagined for the role.

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else.

But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books. Pictures and Illustrations are also absent from audiobooks, because it is only the voice of the narrator. The narrator, in which you mostly do not also have the choice of. I hate it when the narrator doesn't sound how you would imagine the characters to sound like in your mind, the same way as with the books turned into movies where the actors don't look like their description or someone else that you would've imagined for the role.

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books. Pictures and Illustrations are also absent from audiobooks, because it is only the voice of the narrator. The narrator, in which you mostly do not also have the choice of. I hate it when the narrator doesn't sound how you would imagine the characters to sound like in your mind, the same way as with the books turned into movies where the actors don't look like their description or someone else that you would've imagined for the role.

One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books.

With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books. Pictures and Illustrations are also absent from audiobooks, because it is only the voice of the narrator. The narrator, in which you mostly do not also have the choice of. I hate it when the narrator doesn't sound how you would imagine the characters to sound like in your mind, the same way as with the books turned into movies where the actors don't look like their description or someone else that you would've imagined for the role.

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books. Pictures and Illustrations are also absent from audiobooks, because it is only the voice of the narrator. The narrator, in which you mostly do not also have the choice of. I hate it when the narrator doesn't sound how you would imagine the characters to sound like in your mind, the same way as with the books turned into movies where the actors don't look like their description or someone else that you would've imagined for the role. 

As for conserving trees and preventing climate change, sure. You got me there. But books are also saving on paper by the way.

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else.

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books. Pictures and Illustrations are also absent from audiobooks, because it is only the voice of the narrator. The narrator, in which you mostly do not also have the choice of. I hate it when the narrator doesn't sound how you would imagine the characters to sound like in your mind, the same way as with the books turned into movies where the actors don't look like their description or someone else that you would've imagined for the role. 

As for conserving trees and preventing climate change, sure. You got me there. But books are also saving on paper by the way. They save paper by the virtual bookshelf full of e-books that are available online. E-books are getting really popular nowadays and even more accessible and very more forgiving for your internet bandwidt",user,28,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else.

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else.

However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books. Pictures and Illustrations are also absent from audiobooks, because it is only the voice of the narrator. The narrator, in which you mostly do not also have the choice of. I hate it when the narrator doesn't sound how you would imagine the characters to sound like in your mind, the same way as with the books turned into movies where the actors don't look like their description or someone else that you would've imagined for the role. 

As for conserving trees and preventing climate change, sure. You got me there. But books are also saving on paper by the way. They save paper by the virtual bookshelf full of e-books that are available online. E-books are getting really popular nowadays and even more accessible and very more forgiving for your internet bandwidth.

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books. Pictures and Illustrations are also absent from audiobooks, because it is only the voice of the narrator. The narrator, in which you mostly do not also have the choice of. I hate it when the narrator doesn't sound how you would imagine the characters to sound like in your mind, the same way as with the books turned into movies where the actors don't look like their description or someone else that you would've imagined for the role. 

As for conserving trees and preventing climate change, sure. You got me there. But books are also saving on paper by the way. They save paper by the virtual bookshelf full of e-books that are available online. E-books are getting really popular nowadays and even more accessible and very more forgiving for your internet bandwidth. 

So in short, audiobooks are ok if you're busy and on the go, but I believe The Written Word (books) are better, more honest, and a lot more enjoyable. I hope you agree with me and you open you",user,30,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books. Pictures and Illustrations are also absent from audiobooks, because it is only the voice of the narrator. The narrator, in which you mostly do not also have the choice of. I hate it when the narrator doesn't sound how you would imagine the characters to sound like in your mind, the same way as with the books turned into movies where the actors don't look like their description or someone else that you would've imagined for the role. 

As for conserving trees and preventing climate change, sure. You got me there. But books are also saving on paper by the way. They save paper by the virtual bookshelf full of e-books that are available online. E-books are getting really popular nowadays and even more accessible and very more forgiving for your internet bandwidth.

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book.

But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books. Pictures and Illustrations are also absent from audiobooks, because it is only the voice of the narrator. The narrator, in which you mostly do not also have the choice of. I hate it when the narrator doesn't sound how you would imagine the characters to sound like in your mind, the same way as with the books turned into movies where the actors don't look like their description or someone else that you would've imagined for the role. 

As for conserving trees and preventing climate change, sure. You got me there. But books are also saving on paper by the way. They save paper by the virtual bookshelf full of e-books that are available online. E-books are getting really popular nowadays and even more accessible and very more forgiving for your internet bandwidth.

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books. Pictures and Illustrations are also absent from audiobooks, because it is only the voice of the narrator. The narrator, in which you mostly do not also have the choice of. I hate it when the narrator doesn't sound how you would imagine the characters to sound like in your mind, the same way as with the books turned into movies where the actors don't look like their description or someone else that you would've imagined for the role.

Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books. Pictures and Illustrations are also absent from audiobooks, because it is only the voice of the narrator. The narrator, in which you mostly do not also have the choice of. I hate it when the narrator doesn't sound how you would imagine the characters to sound like in your mind, the same way as with the books turned into movies where the actors don't look like their description or someone else that you would've imagined for the role. 

As for conserving trees and preventing climate change, sure. You got me there. But books are also saving on paper by the way. They save paper by the virtual bookshelf full of e-books that are available online. E-books are getting really popular nowadays and even more accessible and very more forgiving for your internet bandwidth.

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things.

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books. Pictures and Illustrations are also absent from audiobooks, because it is only the voice of the narrator. The narrator, in which you mostly do not also have the choice of. I hate it when the narrator doesn't sound how you would imagine the characters to sound like in your mind, the same way as with the books turned into movies where the actors don't look like their description or someone else that you would've imagined for the role. 

As for conserving trees and preventing climate change, sure. You got me there. But books are also saving on paper by the way. They save paper by the virtual bookshelf full of e-books that are available online. E-books are getting really popular nowadays and even more accessible and very more forgiving for your internet bandwidth. 

So in short, audiobooks are ok if you're busy and on the go, but I believe The Written Word (books) are better, more honest, and a lot more enjoyable. I hope you agree with me and you open your first book to read in a while. Happy re",user,31,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
