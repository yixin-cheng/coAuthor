Remember the time when gladiators have had to fight to the death? It sure felt like sport at the time, but we as a society have evolved and we have realized that it's not a sport. It's a barbaric act. And I know a lot of enthusiast and ""athletes"" of extreme sports will disagree with me, but I think it's just as barbaric.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it. Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, we should ban risky sports like mountain climbing to be called a sports. I'm sure a lot of you disagree, but I think it's too dangerous. Remember the time when gladiators have had to fight to the death? It sure felt like sport at the time, but we as a society have evolved and we have realized that it's not a sport. It's a barbaric act. And I know a lot of enthusiast and ""athletes"" of extreme sports will disagree with me, but I think it's just as barbaric.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it. Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, we should ban risky sports like mountain climbing to be called a sports. I'm sure a lot of you disagree, but I think it's too dangerous. Remember the time when gladiators have had to fight to the death? It sure felt like sport at the time, but we as a society have evolved and we have realized that it's not a sport. It's a barbaric act. And I know a lot of enthusiast and ""athletes"" of extreme sports will disagree with me, but I think it's just as barbaric.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it. Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things.

Remember the time when gladiators have had to fight to the death? It sure felt like sport at the time, but we as a society have evolved and we have realized that it's not a sport. It's a barbaric act. And I know a lot of enthusiast and ""athletes"" of extreme sports will disagree with me, but I think it's just as barbaric.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it. Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, we should ban risky sports like mountain climbing to be called a sports. I'm sure a lot of you disagree, but I think it's too dangerous. Remember the time when gladiators have had to fight to the death? It sure felt like sport at the time, but we as a society have evolved and we have realized that it's not a sport. It's a barbaric act. And I know a lot of enthusiast and ""athletes"" of extreme sports will disagree with me, but I think it's just as barbaric.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it. Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Yet, thousands or even millions of people are willing to risk their lives just to get a thrill. It's something that we as a society have to stop.

In my opinion, we should ban risky sports like mountain climbing to be called a sports. I'm sure a lot of you disagree, but I think it's too dangerous. Remember the time when gladiators have had to fight to the death? It sure felt like sport at the time, but we as a society have evolved and we have realized that it's not a sport. It's a barbaric act. And I know a lot of enthusiast and ""athletes"" of extreme sports will disagree with me, but I think it's just as barbaric.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it. Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Yet, thousands or even millions of people are willing to risk their lives just to get a thrill. It's something that we as a society have to stop.

It's a barbaric act. And I know a lot of enthusiast and ""athletes"" of extreme sports will disagree with me, but I think it's just as barbaric.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it. Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Yet, thousands or even millions of people are willing to risk their lives just to get a thrill. It's something that we as a society have to stop. There are very safe alternatives such as esports, where you can get the thrill of competition without risking your life. The esports industry is thriving. Last 2019, esports earnings have gone up to $696 million, and it's expected to reach $1.5 billion by 2020.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Yet, thousands or even millions of people are willing to risk their lives just to get a thrill. It's something that we as a society have to stop. There are very safe alternatives such as esports, where you can get the thrill of competition without risking your life. The esports industry is thriving.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things.

In my opinion, we should ban risky sports like mountain climbing to be called a sports. I'm sure a lot of you disagree, but I think it's too dangerous.

Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Yet, thousands or even millions of people are willing to risk their lives just to get a thrill. It's something that we as a society have to stop. There are very safe alternatives such as esports, where you can get the thrill of competition without risking your life. The esports industry is thriving.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, we should ban risky sports like mountain climbing to be called a sports. I'm sure a lot of you disagree, but I think it's too dangerous.

Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Yet, thousands or even millions of people are willing to risk their lives just to get a thrill. It's something that we as a society have to stop. There are very safe alternatives such as esports, where you can get the thrill of competition without risking your life. The esports industry is thriving.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it. Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Yet, thousands or even millions of people are willing to risk their lives just to get a thrill. It's something that we as a society have to stop. There are very safe alternatives such as esports, where you can get the thrill of competition without risking your life. The esports industry is thriving.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, we should ban risky sports like mountain climbing to be called a sports. I'm sure a lot of you disagree, but I think it's too dangerous. Remember the time when gladiators have had to fight to the death? It sure felt like sport at the time, but we as a society have evolved and we have realized that it's not a sport. It's a barbaric act. And I know a lot of enthusiast and ""athletes"" of extreme sports will disagree with me, but I think it's just as barbaric.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it. Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Yet, thousands or even millions of people are willing to risk their lives just to get a thrill. It's something that we as a society have to stop. There are very safe alternatives such as esports, where you can get the thrill of competition without risking your life. The esports industry is thriving. Last 2019, esports earnings have gone up to $696 million, and it's expected to reach $1.5 billion by 2020.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, we should ban risky sports like mountain climbing to be called a sports. I'm sure a lot of you disagree, but I think it's too dangerous. Remember the time when gladiators have had to fight to the death? It sure felt like sport at the time, but we as a society have evolved and we have realized that it's not a sport. It's a barbaric act. And I know a lot of enthusiast and ""athletes"" of extreme sports will disagree with me, but I think it's just as barbaric.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it. Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Remember the time when gladiators have had to fight to the death? It sure felt like sport at the time, but we as a society have evolved and we have realized that it's not a sport. It's a barbaric act. And I know a lot of enthusiast and ""athletes"" of extreme sports will disagree with me, but I think it's just as barbaric.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it. Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Yet, thousands or even millions of people are willing to risk their lives just to get a thrill. It's something that we as a society have to stop. There are very safe alternatives such as esports, where you can get the thrill of competition without risking your life. The esports industry is thriving. Last 2019, esports earnings have gone up to $696 million, and it's expected to reach $1.5 billion by 2020.

So, for the love of those around you and everyone else that is in your life, please stop risking your life for a thrill. We've lost too much in our society because o",user,25,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, we should ban risky sports like mountain climbing to be called a sports. I'm sure a lot of you disagree, but I think it's too dangerous. Remember the time when gladiators have had to fight to the death? It sure felt like sport at the time, but we as a society have evolved and we have realized that it's not a sport. It's a barbaric act. And I know a lot of enthusiast and ""athletes"" of extreme sports will disagree with me, but I think it's just as barbaric.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it.

Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Remember the time when gladiators have had to fight to the death? It sure felt like sport at the time, but we as a society have evolved and we have realized that it's not a sport.

Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Remember the time when gladiators have had to fight to the death? It sure felt like sport at the time, but we as a society have evolved and we have realized that it's not a sport. It's a barbaric act. And I know a lot of enthusiast and ""athletes"" of extreme sports will disagree with me, but I think it's just as barbaric.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it. Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Yet, thousands or even millions of people are willing to risk their lives just to get a thrill. It's something that we as a society have to stop. There are very safe alternatives such as esports, where you can get the thrill of competition without risking your life. The esports industry is thriving. Last 2019, esports earnings have gone up to $696 million, and it's expected to reach $1.5 billion by 2020.

So, for the love of those around you and everyone else that is in your life, please stop risking your life for a thrill. We've lost too much in our society because of Covid. We don't need to lose anymore by people jumping off cliffs or dying because they climbed a mountain. We all need to be more responsible.",api,27,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
