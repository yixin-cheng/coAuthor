In my opinion, although extra screen time has been needed during the pandemic, I still think we should be very worried about the excessive screen use if it continues.  think we should be worried about titbecause it has been shown to cause a variety of problems.
 One of these problems I have personal experience with and that is impaired sleep. It is now well known that staring at these screens, especially right before bedtime, can have a detrimental effect on our sleep-wake cycles.  have been using my fsmartphone to check email or a few years now and I have noticed that when I use it before bedtime, I hseem to awaken randomly in the night. Sometimes it may even take me up to an hour to fall asleep again. This is not good for my sleep-wake cycle and I am sure it is not good for my health. I hate to imagine how this affects the developing brains of children as young as 6.

 One of these problems I have personal experience with and that is impaired sleep. It is now well known that staring at these screens, especially right before bedtime, can have a detrimental effect on our sleep-wake cycles.  have been using my fsmartphone to check email or a few years now and I have noticed that when I use it before bedtime, I hseem to awaken randomly in the night. Sometimes it may even take me up to an hour to fall asleep again. This is not good for my sleep-wake cycle and I am sure it is not good for my health.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, although extra screen time has been needed during the pandemic, I still think we should be very worried about the excessive screen use if it continues.  think we should be worried about titbecause it has been shown to cause a variety of problems.
 One of these problems I have personal experience with and that is impaired sleep. It is now well known that staring at these screens, especially right before bedtime, can have a detrimental effect on our sleep-wake cycles.  have been using my fsmartphone to check email or a few years now and I have noticed that when I use it before bedtime, I hseem to awaken randomly in the night. Sometimes it may even take me up to an hour to fall asleep again. This is not good for my sleep-wake cycle and I am sure it is not good for my health. I hate to imagine how this affects the developing brains of children as young as 6. 
Another reason we still need to be worried about excessive screen use is because of the lack of physical activity. Especially if people are playing games and doing other things with their devices for long periods of time throughout the day, that is less time that someone may be standing up to do anything at all.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, although extra screen time has been needed during the pandemic, I still think we should be very worried about the excessive screen use if it continues.  think we should be worried about titbecause it has been shown to cause a variety of problems.
 One of these problems I have personal experience with and that is impaired sleep. It is now well known that staring at these screens, especially right before bedtime, can have a detrimental effect on our sleep-wake cycles.  have been using my fsmartphone to check email or a few years now and I have noticed that when I use it before bedtime, I hseem to awaken randomly in the night. Sometimes it may even take me up to an hour to fall asleep again. This is not good for my sleep-wake cycle and I am sure it is not good for my health. I hate to imagine how this affects the developing brains of children as young as 6. 
Another reason we still need to be worried about excessive screen use is because of the lack of physical activity. Especially if people are playing games and doing other things with their devices for long periods of time throughout the day, that is less time that someone may be standing up to do anything at all. It's hard to make time for exercise with you face always in a screen.

In my opinion, although extra screen time has been needed during the pandemic, I still think we should be very worried about the excessive screen use if it continues.  think we should be worried about titbecause it has been shown to cause a variety of problems.
 One of these problems I have personal experience with and that is impaired sleep. It is now well known that staring at these screens, especially right before bedtime, can have a detrimental effect on our sleep-wake cycles.  have been using my fsmartphone to check email or a few years now and I have noticed that when I use it before bedtime, I hseem to awaken randomly in the night. Sometimes it may even take me up to an hour to fall asleep again. This is not good for my sleep-wake cycle and I am sure it is not good for my health. I hate to imagine how this affects the developing brains of children as young as 6. 
Another reason we still need to be worried about excessive screen use is because of the lack of physical activity. Especially if people are playing games and doing other things with their devices for long periods of time throughout the day, that is less time that someone may be standing up to do anything at all.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, although extra screen time has been needed during the pandemic, I still think we should be very worried about the excessive screen use if it continues.  think we should be worried about titbecause it has been shown to cause a variety of problems.
 One of these problems I have personal experience with and that is impaired sleep. It is now well known that staring at these screens, especially right before bedtime, can have a detrimental effect on our sleep-wake cycles.  have been using my fsmartphone to check email or a few years now and I have noticed that when I use it before bedtime, I hseem to awaken randomly in the night. Sometimes it may even take me up to an hour to fall asleep again. This is not good for my sleep-wake cycle and I am sure it is not good for my health. I hate to imagine how this affects the developing brains of children as young as 6. 
Another reason we still need to be worried about excessive screen use is because of the lack of physical activity. Especially if people are playing games and doing other things with their devices for long periods of time throughout the day, that is less time that someone may be standing up to do anything at all. It's hard to make time for exercise with you face always in a screen.

It is now well known that staring at these screens, especially right before bedtime, can have a detrimental effect on our sleep-wake cycles.  have been using my fsmartphone to check email or a few years now and I have noticed that when I use it before bedtime, I hseem to awaken randomly in the night. Sometimes it may even take me up to an hour to fall asleep again. This is not good for my sleep-wake cycle and I am sure it is not good for my health.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, although extra screen time has been needed during the pandemic, I still think we should be very worried about the excessive screen use if it continues.  think we should be worried about titbecause it has been shown to cause a variety of problems.
 One of these problems I have personal experience with and that is impaired sleep. It is now well known that staring at these screens, especially right before bedtime, can have a detrimental effect on our sleep-wake cycles.  have been using my fsmartphone to check email or a few years now and I have noticed that when I use it before bedtime, I hseem to awaken randomly in the night. Sometimes it may even take me up to an hour to fall asleep again. This is not good for my sleep-wake cycle and I am sure it is not good for my health. I hate to imagine how this affects the developing brains of children as young as 6. 
Another reason we still need to be worried about excessive screen use is because of the lack of physical activity. Especially if people are playing games and doing other things with their devices for long periods of time throughout the day, that is less time that someone may be standing up to do anything at all. It's hard to make time for exercise with you face always in a screen.  
he last reason I think we should be worried about excessive screen use is because of the lack of social interaction.
 This, of course, would not apply to those who use the screen to connect with others through zoom. But, if you're only doing activities on your screen in isolation, this could have bad effects on our ability to socialize over time.

 One of these problems I have personal experience with and that is impaired sleep. It is now well known that staring at these screens, especially right before bedtime, can have a detrimental effect on our sleep-wake cycles.  have been using my fsmartphone to check email or a few years now and I have noticed that when I use it before bedtime, I hseem to awaken randomly in the night. Sometimes it may even take me up to an hour to fall asleep again. This is not good for my sleep-wake cycle and I am sure it is not good for my health. I hate to imagine how this affects the developing brains of children as young as 6. 
Another reason we still need to be worried about excessive screen use is because of the lack of physical activity.

It is now well known that staring at these screens, especially right before bedtime, can have a detrimental effect on our sleep-wake cycles.  have been using my fsmartphone to check email or a few years now and I have noticed that when I use it before bedtime, I hseem to awaken randomly in the night.
