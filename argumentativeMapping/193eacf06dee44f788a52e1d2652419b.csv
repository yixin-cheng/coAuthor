 Not having the necessary items for self care is both physically harmful and emotionally stressful. It puts an undo burden on young women to allow them to go through a day at school without what they need to take care of themselves. 

There is no opportunity for a child to better their own situation. These young people are expected to attend school, and they need all of the necessary supplies to do that in a healthy, safe and comfortable way. When the parents can't afford lunch, most school systems, who can afford it, provide lunch for the student. The same principle needs to apply to young women and girls who may need sanitary supplies, and cannot afford them. 

Resources are very limited in many school districts and I empathize with their plight, but forcing children to attend school all day without making sure they have adequate supplies is simply wrong. It shouldn't matter what gender the student is, or what the need is. If there is a need, the school needs to be accountable for making sure that the need is met. I hope that resources become easier to come by for these schools but until then, there can be no excuses made. You",user,21,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
