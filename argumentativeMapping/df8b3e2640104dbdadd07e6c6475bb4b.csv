Technology is a double-edged sword. The smartphone has given us the ability to replace great interpersonal connections with dehumanizing ones and can put a damper on relationships. However, it also allows us to connect with people we otherwise wouldn’t.

 think it is important to have multiple types of relationships and interactions to maintain proper self-care.
 It is important not to allow all of our social connections to come from the digital realm. Technology is a great tool and is more than just a distraction from our interpersonal relationships, but I think it should be used in a healthy moderation. 
Technology is great because it has enabled communication.
 Before smartphones and texting I would speak to my partner only when we were together. Now with texting and snap chat, I can communicate with him during when we are apart. echnology can also be used to avoid issues or challenges with a relationship.
 If we have a disagreement while we are with each other we can text or email instead of arguing in person. It gives us time to cool off, and re-read what we want to say. This way we can have a much less intense argument and deal with the issue in a civil manner.

Technology is a wonderful thing but can also be used dnegatively  I think there are also many negatives with the communication aspects of social media. It can make relationships superficial. I don't feel ""face to face"" conversation is as important to people as it used to be. We often end up communicating in these short texts that doesn't require as much effort and thought.  Posts can also be misinterpreted.

Dating apps often make dating seem like a one-sided, automatic process.
 It makes it easier to feel like dating is a game. If someone doesn't respond within a day or two, you move on to the next person. You don't get to know the person as well as you would in a normal situation.
he amount of technology being used today hinders the normal dating process.
 With dating apps all that matters is you swiping left or right to get to the next person.
