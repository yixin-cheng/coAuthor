Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, human's put too much human emotion onto their animals or other similar animals. They anthropomorphize them and think they hurt and suffer the way humans do. I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because humans are more important. I could go into how God promotes this notion but that would end this debate in an instant and the atheist out there would dismiss it out of ignorance. I think people see their dogs and cats as part of the family when in reality they are just using us for food and shelter while we are the ones that give their actions purpose and most are geared towards us humans. Does a worm scream when you put a hook through it? No, it does not understand what it is feeling and does not understand the concept of death so its just an inconvenience until it is eaten by a fish in the natural cycle of things.

In my opinion, human's put too much human emotion onto their animals or other similar animals. They anthropomorphize them and think they hurt and suffer the way humans do. I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because humans are more important. I could go into how God promotes this notion but that would end this debate in an instant and the atheist out there would dismiss it out of ignorance. I think people see their dogs and cats as part of the family when in reality they are just using us for food and shelter while we are the ones that give their actions purpose and most are geared towards us humans. Does a worm scream when you put a hook through it? No, it does not understand what it is feeling and does not understand the concept of death so its just an inconvenience until it is eaten by a fish in the natural cycle of things.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, human's put too much human emotion onto their animals or other similar animals. They anthropomorphize them and think they hurt and suffer the way humans do. I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because humans are more important. I could go into how God promotes this notion but that would end this debate in an instant and the atheist out there would dismiss it out of ignorance. I think people see their dogs and cats as part of the family when in reality they are just using us for food and shelter while we are the ones that give their actions purpose and most are geared towards us humans. Does a worm scream when you put a hook through it? No, it does not understand what it is feeling and does not understand the concept of death so its just an inconvenience until it is eaten by a fish in the natural cycle of things. Dogs came to be because we fed them when they came around and eventually the dogs realized it was in their best interest to co exist with man and they did not because they agreed upon it but because their instincts led them in that direction.

I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because humans are more important.

No, it does not understand what it is feeling and does not understand the concept of death so its just an inconvenience until it is eaten by a fish in the natural cycle of things.

I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because humans are more important. I could go into how God promotes this notion but that would end this debate in an instant and the atheist out there would dismiss it out of ignorance. I think people see their dogs and cats as part of the family when in reality they are just using us for food and shelter while we are the ones that give their actions purpose and most are geared towards us humans.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, human's put too much human emotion onto their animals or other similar animals. They anthropomorphize them and think they hurt and suffer the way humans do. I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because humans are more important. I could go into how God promotes this notion but that would end this debate in an instant and the atheist out there would dismiss it out of ignorance. I think people see their dogs and cats as part of the family when in reality they are just using us for food and shelter while we are the ones that give their actions purpose and most are geared towards us humans.

In my opinion, human's put too much human emotion onto their animals or other similar animals. They anthropomorphize them and think they hurt and suffer the way humans do. I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because humans are more important. I could go into how God promotes this notion but that would end this debate in an instant and the atheist out there would dismiss it out of ignorance. I think people see their dogs and cats as part of the family when in reality they are just using us for food and shelter while we are the ones that give their actions purpose and most are geared towards us humans. Does a worm scream when you put a hook through it? No, it does not understand what it is feeling and does not understand the concept of death so its just an inconvenience until it is eaten by a fish in the natural cycle of things. Dogs came to be because we fed them when they came around and eventually the dogs realized it was in their best interest to co exist with man and they did not because they agreed upon it but because their instincts led them in that direction.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, human's put too much human emotion onto their animals or other similar animals. They anthropomorphize them and think they hurt and suffer the way humans do. I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because humans are more important. I could go into how God promotes this notion but that would end this debate in an instant and the atheist out there would dismiss it out of ignorance. I think people see their dogs and cats as part of the family when in reality they are just using us for food and shelter while we are the ones that give their actions purpose and most are geared towards us humans. Does a worm scream when you put a hook through it? No, it does not understand what it is feeling and does not understand the concept of death so its just an inconvenience until it is eaten by a fish in the natural cycle of things. Dogs came to be because we fed them when they came around and eventually the dogs realized it was in their best interest to co exist with man and they did not because they agreed upon it but because their instincts led them in that direction.

I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because humans are more important. I could go into how God promotes this notion but that would end this debate in an instant and the atheist out there would dismiss it out of ignorance. I think people see their dogs and cats as part of the family when in reality they are just using us for food and shelter while we are the ones that give their actions purpose and most are geared towards us humans.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.
