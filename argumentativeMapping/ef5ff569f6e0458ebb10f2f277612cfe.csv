This can make interacting in the world outside of their games more of a challenge than it already is for young people.

This can make interacting in the world outside of their games more of a challenge than it already is for young people.

In my opinion, it's important to limit the amount of screen time anyone spends. This is especially true with children, and the amount of time that they spend in front of a screen. 
Screen time comes with a price tag.
 While it is interactive, and can be social as well, it synthesizes an environment outside of our everyday world. It is possible to become too engrossed by this simulated world. When the world of screens becomes our predominant reality, we can become increasingly detached from ‘reality’ and exist more and more in the limbo of virtual reality. An extreme example of this, though not an uncommon one, is the rise of the gamer class. Gamers spend hours and hours every day, every week, every month and every year playing virtual reality games. This can make interacting in the world outside of their games more of a challenge than it already is for young people. 

A gamer may have difficulties reading social cues, they may have difficulties organizing their lives, they may have difficulties functioning in the world. Of course, this can be said of anyone who has spent too much time behind the soft glow of a virtual world. 
I do not believe that there is a right canned amount of how much screen time someone should use.
 I do, however, believe that there are signs that a user is overindulging in screen time. Those signs include anything from distracting yourself with work, to constantly being on your phone while interacting with people in ‘real’ life. Finding reasons to get in front of a screen, when there are other options available, is a sign that a person should take a look at how much time they are spending in virtual space. 
Being wary of screen time is not out of line with appreciating the benefits that our devices provide.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, it's important to limit the amount of screen time anyone spends. This is especially true with children, and the amount of time that they spend in front of a screen. 
Screen time comes with a price tag.
 While it is interactive, and can be social as well, it synthesizes an environment outside of our everyday world. It is possible to become too engrossed by this simulated world. When the world of screens becomes our predominant reality, we can become increasingly detached from ‘reality’ and exist more and more in the limbo of virtual reality. An extreme example of this, though not an uncommon one, is the rise of the gamer class. Gamers spend hours and hours every day, every week, every month and every year playing virtual reality games. This can make interacting in the world outside of their games more of a challenge than it already is for young people. 

A gamer may have difficulties reading social cues, they may have difficulties organizing their lives, they may have difficulties functioning in the world. Of course, this can be said of anyone who has spent too much time behind the soft glow of a virtual world. 
I do not believe that there is a right canned amount of how much screen time someone should use.
 I do, however, believe that there are signs that a user is overindulging in screen time. Those signs include anything from distracting yourself with work, to constantly being on your phone while interacting with people in ‘real’ life. Finding reasons to get in front of a screen, when there are other options available, is a sign that a person should take a look at how much time they are spending in virtual space. 
Being wary of screen time is not out of line with appreciating the benefits that our devices provide.

In my opinion, it's important to limit the amount of screen time anyone spends. This is especially true with children, and the amount of time that they spend in front of a screen. 
Screen time comes with a price tag.
 While it is interactive, and can be social as well, it synthesizes an environment outside of our everyday world. It is possible to become too engrossed by this simulated world. When the world of screens becomes our predominant reality, we can become increasingly detached from ‘reality’ and exist more and more in the limbo of virtual reality. An extreme example of this, though not an uncommon one, is the rise of the gamer class. Gamers spend hours and hours every day, every week, every month and every year playing virtual reality games. This can make interacting in the world outside of their games more of a challenge than it already is for young people. 

A gamer may have difficulties reading social cues, they may have difficulties organizing their lives, they may have difficulties functioning in the world. Of course, this can be said of anyone who has spent too much time behind the soft glow of a virtual world. 
I do not believe that there is a right canned amount of how much screen time someone should use.
 I do, however, believe that there are signs that a user is overindulging in screen time. Those signs include anything from distracting yourself with work, to constantly being on your phone while interacting with people in ‘real’ life. Finding reasons to get in front of a screen, when there are other options available, is a sign that a person should take a look at how much time they are spending in virtual space. 
Being wary of screen time is not out of line with appreciating the benefits that our devices provide.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, it's important to limit the amount of screen time anyone spends. This is especially true with children, and the amount of time that they spend in front of a screen. 
Screen time comes with a price tag.
 While it is interactive, and can be social as well, it synthesizes an environment outside of our everyday world. It is possible to become too engrossed by this simulated world. When the world of screens becomes our predominant reality, we can become increasingly detached from ‘reality’ and exist more and more in the limbo of virtual reality. An extreme example of this, though not an uncommon one, is the rise of the gamer class. Gamers spend hours and hours every day, every week, every month and every year playing virtual reality games. This can make interacting in the world outside of their games more of a challenge than it already is for young people. 

A gamer may have difficulties reading social cues, they may have difficulties organizing their lives, they may have difficulties functioning in the world. Of course, this can be said of anyone who has spent too much time behind the soft glow of a virtual world. 
I do not believe that there is a right canned amount of how much screen time someone should use.
 I do, however, believe that there are signs that a user is overindulging in screen time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, it's important to limit the amount of screen time anyone spends. This is especially true with children, and the amount of time that they spend in front of a screen. 
Screen time comes with a price tag.
 While it is interactive, and can be social as well, it synthesizes an environment outside of our everyday world. It is possible to become too engrossed by this simulated world. When the world of screens becomes our predominant reality, we can become increasingly detached from ‘reality’ and exist more and more in the limbo of virtual reality. An extreme example of this, though not an uncommon one, is the rise of the gamer class. Gamers spend hours and hours every day, every week, every month and every year playing virtual reality games. This can make interacting in the world outside of their games more of a challenge than it already is for young people. 

A gamer may have difficulties reading social cues, they may have difficulties organizing their lives, they may have difficulties functioning in the world. Of course, this can be said of anyone who has spent too much time behind the soft glow of a virtual world. 
I do not believe that there is a right canned amount of how much screen time someone should use.
 I do, however, believe that there are signs that a user is overindulging in screen time. Those signs include anything from distracting yourself with work, to constantly being on your phone while interacting with people in ‘real’ life. Finding reasons to get in front of a screen, when there are other options available, is a sign that a person should take a look at how much time they are spending in virtual space. 
Being wary of screen time is not out of line with appreciating the benefits that our devices provide.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, it's important to limit the amount of screen time anyone spends. This is especially true with children, and the amount of time that they spend in front of a screen. 
Screen time comes with a price tag.
 While it is interactive, and can be social as well, it synthesizes an environment outside of our everyday world. It is possible to become too engrossed by this simulated world. When the world of screens becomes our predominant reality, we can become increasingly detached from ‘reality’ and exist more and more in the limbo of virtual reality. An extreme example of this, though not an uncommon one, is the rise of the gamer class. Gamers spend hours and hours every day, every week, every month and every year playing virtual reality games. This can make interacting in the world outside of their games more of a challenge than it already is for young people. 

A gamer may have difficulties reading social cues, they may have difficulties organizing their lives, they may have difficulties functioning in the world. Of course, this can be said of anyone who has spent too much time behind the soft glow of a virtual world. 
I do not believe that there is a right canned amount of how much screen time someone should use.
 I do, however, believe that there are signs that a user is overindulging in screen time. Those signs include anything from distracting yourself with work, to constantly being on your phone while interacting with people in ‘real’ life. Finding reasons to get in front of a screen, when there are other options available, is a sign that a person should take a look at how much time they are spending in virtual space. 
Being wary of screen time is not out of line with appreciating the benefits that our devices provide.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, it's important to limit the amount of screen time anyone spends. This is especially true with children, and the amount of time that they spend in front of a screen. 
Screen time comes with a price tag.
 While it is interactive, and can be social as well, it synthesizes an environment outside of our everyday world. It is possible to become too engrossed by this simulated world. When the world of screens becomes our predominant reality, we can become increasingly detached from ‘reality’ and exist more and more in the limbo of virtual reality. An extreme example of this, though not an uncommon one, is the rise of the gamer class. Gamers spend hours and hours every day, every week, every month and every year playing virtual reality games. This can make interacting in the world outside of their games more of a challenge than it already is for young people. 

A gamer may have difficulties reading social cues, they may have difficulties organizing their lives, they may have difficulties functioning in the world. Of course, this can be said of anyone who has spent too much time behind the soft glow of a virtual world. 
I do not believe that there is a right canned amount of how much screen time someone should use.
 I do, however, believe that there are signs that a user is overindulging in screen time. Those signs include anything from distracting yourself with work, to constantly being on your phone while interacting with people in ‘real’ life. Finding reasons to get in front of a screen, when there are other options available, is a sign that a person should take a look at how much time they are spending in virtual space. 
Being wary of screen time is not out of line with appreciating the benefits that our devices provide.
 In this modern world, we are going to need to use our screens for the practical aspects of their functionality. We need them for work, and they can b",user,23,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, it's important to limit the amount of screen time anyone spends. This is especially true with children, and the amount of time that they spend in front of a screen. 
Screen time comes with a price tag.
 While it is interactive, and can be social as well, it synthesizes an environment outside of our everyday world. It is possible to become too engrossed by this simulated world. When the world of screens becomes our predominant reality, we can become increasingly detached from ‘reality’ and exist more and more in the limbo of virtual reality. An extreme example of this, though not an uncommon one, is the rise of the gamer class. Gamers spend hours and hours every day, every week, every month and every year playing virtual reality games. This can make interacting in the world outside of their games more of a challenge than it already is for young people. 

A gamer may have difficulties reading social cues, they may have difficulties organizing their lives, they may have difficulties functioning in the world. Of course, this can be said of anyone who has spent too much time behind the soft glow of a virtual world. 
I do not believe that there is a right canned amount of how much screen time someone should use.
 I do, however, believe that there are signs that a user is overindulging in screen time. Those signs include anything from distracting yourself with work, to constantly being on your phone while interacting with people in ‘real’ life. Finding reasons to get in front of a screen, when there are other options available, is a sign that a person should take a look at how much time they are spending in virtual space.

In my opinion, it's important to limit the amount of screen time anyone spends. This is especially true with children, and the amount of time that they spend in front of a screen. 
Screen time comes with a price tag.
 While it is interactive, and can be social as well, it synthesizes an environment outside of our everyday world. It is possible to become too engrossed by this simulated world. When the world of screens becomes our predominant reality, we can become increasingly detached from ‘reality’ and exist more and more in the limbo of virtual reality. An extreme example of this, though not an uncommon one, is the rise of the gamer class. Gamers spend hours and hours every day, every week, every month and every year playing virtual reality games. This can make interacting in the world outside of their games more of a challenge than it already is for young people. 

A gamer may have difficulties reading social cues, they may have difficulties organizing their lives, they may have difficulties functioning in the world. Of course, this can be said of anyone who has spent too much time behind the soft glow of a virtual world.

In my opinion, it's important to limit the amount of screen time anyone spends. This is especially true with children, and the amount of time that they spend in front of a screen. 
Screen time comes with a price tag.
 While it is interactive, and can be social as well, it synthesizes an environment outside of our everyday world. It is possible to become too engrossed by this simulated world. When the world of screens becomes our predominant reality, we can become increasingly detached from ‘reality’ and exist more and more in the limbo of virtual reality. An extreme example of this, though not an uncommon one, is the rise of the gamer class. Gamers spend hours and hours every day, every week, every month and every year playing virtual reality games. This can make interacting in the world outside of their games more of a challenge than it already is for young people. 

A gamer may have difficulties reading social cues, they may have difficulties organizing their lives, they may have difficulties functioning in the world. Of course, this can be said of anyone who has spent too much time behind the soft glow of a virtual world. 
I do not believe that there is a right canned amount of how much screen time someone should use.
 I do, however, believe that there are signs that a user is overindulging in screen time. Those signs include anything from distracting yourself with work, to constantly being on your phone while interacting with people in ‘real’ life. Finding reasons to get in front of a screen, when there are other options available, is a sign that a person should take a look at how much time they are spending in virtual space. 
Being wary of screen time is not out of line with appreciating the benefits that our devices provide.

In my opinion, it's important to limit the amount of screen time anyone spends. This is especially true with children, and the amount of time that they spend in front of a screen. 
Screen time comes with a price tag.
 While it is interactive, and can be social as well, it synthesizes an environment outside of our everyday world. It is possible to become too engrossed by this simulated world. When the world of screens becomes our predominant reality, we can become increasingly detached from ‘reality’ and exist more and more in the limbo of virtual reality. An extreme example of this, though not an uncommon one, is the rise of the gamer class. Gamers spend hours and hours every day, every week, every month and every year playing virtual reality games. This can make interacting in the world outside of their games more of a challenge than it already is for young people.

In my opinion, it's important to limit the amount of screen time anyone spends. This is especially true with children, and the amount of time that they spend in front of a screen. 
Screen time comes with a price tag.
 While it is interactive, and can be social as well, it synthesizes an environment outside of our everyday world. It is possible to become too engrossed by this simulated world. When the world of screens becomes our predominant reality, we can become increasingly detached from ‘reality’ and exist more and more in the limbo of virtual reality. An extreme example of this, though not an uncommon one, is the rise of the gamer class. Gamers spend hours and hours every day, every week, every month and every year playing virtual reality games. This can make interacting in the world outside of their games more of a challenge than it already is for young people. 

A gamer may have difficulties reading social cues, they may have difficulties organizing their lives, they may have difficulties functioning in the world. Of course, this can be said of anyone who has spent too much time behind the soft glow of a virtual world. 
I do not believe that there is a right canned amount of how much screen time someone should use.
 I do, however, believe that there are signs that a user is overindulging in screen time. Those signs include anything from distracting yourself with work, to constantly being on your phone while interacting with people in ‘real’ life. Finding reasons to get in front of a screen, when there are other options available, is a sign that a person should take a look at how much time they are spending in virtual space. 
Being wary of screen time is not out of line with appreciating the benefits that our devices provide.
 In this modern world, we are going to need to use our screens for the practical aspects of their functionality. We need them for work, and they can be an enjoyable getaway for someone who is looking for a break from their day. I would only caution tha",user,24,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Screen time comes with a price tag.
 While it is interactive, and can be social as well, it synthesizes an environment outside of our everyday world. It is possible to become too engrossed by this simulated world.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, it's important to limit the amount of screen time anyone spends. This is especially true with children, and the amount of time that they spend in front of a screen. 
Screen time comes with a price tag.
 While it is interactive, and can be social as well, it synthesizes an environment outside of our everyday world. It is possible to become too engrossed by this simulated world. When the world of screens becomes our predominant reality, we can become increasingly detached from ‘reality’ and exist more and more in the limbo of virtual reality. An extreme example of this, though not an uncommon one, is the rise of the gamer class. Gamers spend hours and hours every day, every week, every month and every year playing virtual reality games. This can make interacting in the world outside of their games more of a challenge than it already is for young people. 

A gamer may have difficulties reading social cues, they may have difficulties organizing their lives, they may have difficulties functioning in the world. Of course, this can be said of anyone who has spent too much time behind the soft glow of a virtual world.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, it's important to limit the amount of screen time anyone spends. This is especially true with children, and the amount of time that they spend in front of a screen. 
Screen time comes with a price tag.
 While it is interactive, and can be social as well, it synthesizes an environment outside of our everyday world. It is possible to become too engrossed by this simulated world. When the world of screens becomes our predominant reality, we can become increasingly detached from ‘reality’ and exist more and more in the limbo of virtual reality. An extreme example of this, though not an uncommon one, is the rise of the gamer class. Gamers spend hours and hours every day, every week, every month and every year playing virtual reality games. This can make interacting in the world outside of their games more of a challenge than it already is for young people. 

A gamer may have difficulties reading social cues, they may have difficulties organizing their lives, they may have difficulties functioning in the world. Of course, this can be said of anyone who has spent too much time behind the soft glow of a virtual world. 
I do not believe that there is a right canned amount of how much screen time someone should use.
 I do, however, believe that there are signs that a user is overindulging in screen time. Those signs include anything from distracting yourself with work, to constantly being on your phone while interacting with people in ‘real’ life. Finding reasons to get in front of a screen, when there are other options available, is a sign that a person should take a look at how much time they are spending in virtual space.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, it's important to limit the amount of screen time anyone spends. This is especially true with children, and the amount of time that they spend in front of a screen. 
Screen time comes with a price tag.
 While it is interactive, and can be social as well, it synthesizes an environment outside of our everyday world. It is possible to become too engrossed by this simulated world. When the world of screens becomes our predominant reality, we can become increasingly detached from ‘reality’ and exist more and more in the limbo of virtual reality. An extreme example of this, though not an uncommon one, is the rise of the gamer class. Gamers spend hours and hours every day, every week, every month and every year playing virtual reality games. This can make interacting in the world outside of their games more of a challenge than it already is for young people. 

A gamer may have difficulties reading social cues, they may have difficulties organizing their lives, they may have difficulties functioning in the world. Of course, this can be said of anyone who has spent too much time behind the soft glow of a virtual world. 
I do not believe that there is a right canned amount of how much screen time someone should use.
 I do, however, believe that there are signs that a user is overindulging in screen time. Those signs include anything from distracting yourself with work, to constantly being on your phone while interacting with people in ‘real’ life. Finding reasons to get in front of a screen, when there are other options available, is a sign that a person should take a look at how much time they are spending in virtual space. 
Being wary of screen time is not out of line with appreciating the benefits that our devices provide.
 In this modern world, we are going to need to use our screens for the practical aspects of their functionality.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, it's important to limit the amount of screen time anyone spends. This is especially true with children, and the amount of time that they spend in front of a screen. 
Screen time comes with a price tag.
 While it is interactive, and can be social as well, it synthesizes an environment outside of our everyday world. It is possible to become too engrossed by this simulated world. When the world of screens becomes our predominant reality, we can become increasingly detached from ‘reality’ and exist more and more in the limbo of virtual reality. An extreme example of this, though not an uncommon one, is the rise of the gamer class. Gamers spend hours and hours every day, every week, every month and every year playing virtual reality games. This can make interacting in the world outside of their games more of a challenge than it already is for young people. 

A gamer may have difficulties reading social cues, they may have difficulties organizing their lives, they may have difficulties functioning in the world. Of course, this can be said of anyone who has spent too much time behind the soft glow of a virtual world. 
I do not believe that there is a right canned amount of how much screen time someone should use.
 I do, however, believe that there are signs that a user is overindulging in screen time. Those signs include anything from distracting yourself with work, to constantly being on your phone while interacting with people in ‘real’ life. Finding reasons to get in front of a screen, when there are other options available, is a sign that a person should take a look at how much time they are spending in virtual space. 
Being wary of screen time is not out of line with appreciating the benefits that our devices provide.
 In this modern world, we are going to need to use our screens for the practical aspects of their functionality. We need them for work, and they can be an enjoyable getaway for someone who is looking for a break from their day. I would only caution that this screen time should never become a replacement for living in the world. If it does, then I believe that you are overindulging in your screen time.",api,25,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
