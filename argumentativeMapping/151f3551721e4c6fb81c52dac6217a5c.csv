How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology is something that can help you find relationships and build stronger ones. I personally rely heavily on online dating sites while at the same time we’re also seeing a rise in “dating” apps with some great algorithms for helping you find a match. It just gets easier and more efficient. If you believe opposite attract you can put in the characteristics you desire in a partner and search that way or find someone who has a lot in common with you as most do. Using apps to find love has never been so easy and common place. It used to be a fringe thing, then the younger generations started to embrace it and the rest was history. Now I would now have it any other way. I am sure it also helps you to be who you are (if you're honest) because so much is known about you before the first in person date. Its also hard for me to describe how good it is to weed out the people who you know will not work.

Now I would now have it any other way. I am sure it also helps you to be who you are (if you're honest) because so much is known about you before the first in person date. Its also hard for me to describe how good it is to weed out the people who you know will not work.

In my opinion, technology is something that can help you find relationships and build stronger ones. I personally rely heavily on online dating sites while at the same time we’re also seeing a rise in “dating” apps with some great algorithms for helping you find a match. It just gets easier and more efficient. If you believe opposite attract you can put in the characteristics you desire in a partner and search that way or find someone who has a lot in common with you as most do. Using apps to find love has never been so easy and common place. It used to be a fringe thing, then the younger generations started to embrace it and the rest was history. Now I would now have it any other way. I am sure it also helps you to be who you are (if you're honest) because so much is known about you before the first in person date. Its also hard for me to describe how good it is to weed out the people who you know will not work.

In my opinion, technology is something that can help you find relationships and build stronger ones. I personally rely heavily on online dating sites while at the same time we’re also seeing a rise in “dating” apps with some great algorithms for helping you find a match. It just gets easier and more efficient. If you believe opposite attract you can put in the characteristics you desire in a partner and search that way or find someone who has a lot in common with you as most do. Using apps to find love has never been so easy and common place. It used to be a fringe thing, then the younger generations started to embrace it and the rest was history. Now I would now have it any other way. I am sure it also helps you to be who you are (if you're honest) because so much is known about you before the first in person date. Its also hard for me to describe how good it is to weed out the people who you know will not work. 
Dating apps and tech is the way to go. Its the best way to find the partner you are specifically looking for (within reason of course). It simply gives you a whole ocean at your finger tips instead of the small pond around your town.  ",user,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
