Bullying, shaming, and otherwise other negative social interactions can not only immediately harm the victims, but also have lasting effects on them that are negative as well. he same is true for period shaming., which can not only make the victim feel awful in regards to a natural body process they have, but also lower their self-esteem and how they view their bodies. If they are shamed for being unable to purchase pads and tampons, the shame can also be extended to other areas of their lives that is affected by poverty and finances, and they as a consequence may feel like they are not worthy of anything. For female students, being period shamed for whatever reasons that may be will affect the quality of education they receive, and also affect their ability to learn.

Given the negative outcomes of period shaming, schools should take greater initiatives to prevent them as well as ensure they offer safe and comfortable learning environments for their students.

Bullying, shaming, and otherwise other negative social interactions can not only immediately harm the victims, but also have lasting effects on them that are negative as well. he same is true for period shaming., which can not only make the victim feel awful in regards to a natural body process they have, but also lower their self-esteem and how they view their bodies. If they are shamed for being unable to purchase pads and tampons, the shame can also be extended to other areas of their lives that is affected by poverty and finances, and they as a consequence may feel like they are not worthy of anything. For female students, being period shamed for whatever reasons that may be will affect the quality of education they receive, and also affect their ability to learn.

Given the negative outcomes of period shaming, schools should take greater initiatives to prevent them as well as ensure they offer safe and comfortable learning environments for their students.
