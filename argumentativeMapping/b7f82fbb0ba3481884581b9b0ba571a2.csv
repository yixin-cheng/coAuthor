In my opinion, yes, paying college athletes would hurt the sport in many ways. first of all, it would be a huge distraction for the players. Meaning that they would focus more on their ability to play the game than they would focus on their college academic courses. Why would you care about how well you did in your economics classes when you are making potentially hundreds of thousands playing a sport. You would lose focus do to the money factor. 
Secondly, it would cause a huge rift between the players and the ir fans potentially. You run the even greater risk of fanatics' going to another campus to do serious harm to other students just so their team can come out ahead.
