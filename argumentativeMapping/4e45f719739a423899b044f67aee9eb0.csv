Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

What is a sport? Is it a personal quest for achievement?

A sport is a business, and its purpose is to make money. Pure and simple. A sport gets played because it makes money for the owners. Nowhere in the calculation of profit does it consider the risk to the participants. As long as the public will buy tickets, watch on TV, buy sports apparel, cheer them on as heroes and call their names from the stands, anything goes. he owners do not care whether their employees are alive or dead, so long as they make money.


The idea that society owes a duty of protection to athletes who are budding millionaires, and choose their sport voluntarily, is quaint. Although some may expect them to avoid activities that may result in their premature death, it is not our duty. Capitalism is amoral, money talks, and ethics fall by the wayside.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

A sport is a business, and its purpose is to make money, pure and simple. A sport gets played because it makes money for the owners and player. Nowhere in the calculation of profit does it consider the risk to the participants.
