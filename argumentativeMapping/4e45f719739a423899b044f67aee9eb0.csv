What is a sport? Is it a personal quest for achievement?

Hardly.

A sport is a business, and its purpose is to make money. Pure and simple. A sport gets played because it makes money for the owners. Nowhere in the calculation of profit does it consider the risk to the participants.

The idea that society owes a duty of protection to athletes who are budding millionaires, and choose their sport voluntarily, is quaint. Although some may expect them to avoid activities that may result in their premature death, it is not our duty. Capitalism is amoral, money talks and ethics fall by the wayside.

What is a sport? Is it a personal quest for achievement?

Hardly.

A sport is a business, and its purpose is to make money. Pure and simple. A sport gets played because it makes money for the owners. Nowhere in the calculation of profit does it consider the risk to the participants. As long as the public will buy tickets, watch on TV, buy sports apparel, cheer them on as heroes and call their names from the stands, anything goes. he owners do not care whether their employees are alive or dead, so long as they make money.


The idea that society owes a duty of protection to athletes who are budding millionaires, and choose their sport voluntarily, is quaint. Although some may expect them to avoid activities that may result in their premature death, it is not our duty. Capitalism is amoral, money talks, and ethics fall by the wayside.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

What is a sport? Is it a personal quest for achievement?

Hardly.

A sport is a business, and its purpose is to make money. Pure and simple. A sport gets played because it makes money for the owners. Nowhere in the calculation of profit does it consider the risk to the participants. As long as the public will buy tickets, watch on TV, buy sports apparel, cheer them on as heroes and call their names from the stands, anything goes. he owners do not care whether their employees are alive or dead, so long as they make money.


The idea that society owes a duty of protection to athletes who are budding millionaires, and choose their sport voluntarily, is quaint. Although some may expect them to avoid activities that may result in their premature death, it is not our duty. Capitalism is amoral, money talks, and ethics fall by the wayside.
When we see a wealthy 23-year old pextreme slorts payer being carried on an air stretcher after rupturing a disk in his back,

rensome sports too dangerous to play?
 By what standards could this be even determined? The players are earning a living, and they may be willing to risk their lives, for better or worse. And the point of sports is to push limits and boundaries. 

Without risk, there is no sport. As long as there is demand for high-risk athletes, there will be someone willing to take the chances. And that demand shows no sign of abating. So long as profits exceed the risks, the high-risk sports will persist.

What is a sport? Is it a personal quest for achievement?

Hardly.

A sport is a business, and its purpose is to make money.ure and simple. A sport gets played because it makes money for the owners. Nowhere in the calculation of profit does it consider the risk to the participants. As long as the public will buy tickets, watch on TV, buy sports apparel, cheer them on as heroes and call their names from the stands, anything goes. he owners do not care whether their employees are alive or dead, so long as they make money.


The idea that society owes a duty of protection to athletes who are budding millionaires, and choose their sport voluntarily, is quaint. Although some may expect them to avoid activities that may result in their premature death, it is not our duty. Capitalism is amoral, money talks, and ethics fall by the wayside.

rensome sports too dangerous to play?
 By what standards could this be even determined? The players are earning a living, and they may be willing to risk their lives, for better or worse. And the point of sports is to push limits and boundaries. 

Without risk, there is no sport. As long as there is demand for high-risk athletes, there will be someone willing to take the chances. And that demand shows no sign of abating. So long as profits exceed the risks, the high-risk sports will persist.
