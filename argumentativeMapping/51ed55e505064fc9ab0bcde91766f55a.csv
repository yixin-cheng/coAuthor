We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions.

It's nearly impossible to keep up with every detail that comes across in a 24 hour news cycle. New organizations have a habit of sensationalizing everything, to the point that it's difficult to filtrate out all of the unimportant information that they produce. The recent election in the US taught us that it's difficult to determine what information is really true and what's just one person's opinion. Misinformation has hit new heights in the United States, adding a new, unwelcome dimension to the process of following the news. This is complicated even more when you add in all of the texts, tweets, e-mails, and facebook feeds that fill up a person's news Now, not only does a person need to process the massive amount of news available, to get their information, but they also need to read everything with a suspicious, critical mind.

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

It's nearly impossible to keep up with every detail that comes across in a 24 hour news cycle. New organizations have a habit of sensationalizing everything, to the point that it's difficult to filtrate out all of the unimportant information that they produce. The recent election in the US taught us that it's difficult to determine what information is really true and what's just one person's opinion. Misinformation has hit new heights in the United States, adding a new, unwelcome dimension to the process of following the news.

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

It's nearly impossible to keep up with every detail that comes across in a 24 hour news cycle. New organizations have a habit of sensationalizing everything, to the point that it's difficult to filtrate out all of the unimportant information that they produce. The recent election in the US taught us that it's difficult to determine what information is really true and what's just one person's opinion. Misinformation has hit new heights in the United States, adding a new, unwelcome dimension to the process of following the news.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

It's nearly impossible to keep up with every detail that comes across in a 24 hour news cycle. New organizations have a habit of sensationalizing everything, to the point that it's difficult to filtrate out all of the unimportant information that they produce. The recent election in the US taught us that it's difficult to determine what information is really true and what's just one person's opinion. Misinformation has hit new heights in the United States, adding a new, unwelcome dimension to the process of following the news. This is complicated even more when you add in all of the texts, tweets, e-mails, and facebook feeds that fill up a person's news Now, not only does a person need to process the massive amount of news available, to get their information, but they also need to read everything with a suspicious, critical mind.

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

It's nearly impossible to keep up with every detail that comes across in a 24 hour news cycle. New organizations have a habit of sensationalizing everything, to the point that it's difficult to filtrate out all of the unimportant information that they produce. The recent election in the US taught us that it's difficult to determine what information is really true and what's just one person's opinion. Misinformation has hit new heights in the United States, adding a new, unwelcome dimension to the process of following the news. This is complicated even more when you add in all of the texts, tweets, e-mails, and facebook feeds that fill up a person's news Now, not only does a person need to process the massive amount of news available, to get their information, but they also need to read everything with a suspicious, critical mind. 
Even if people try to stay up-to-date, the sheer amount of news out there seems to be overwhelming.
 Differing opinions are the cornerstone of democracy, but today we have people purposefully filling news feeds with complete fabrications.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

It's nearly impossible to keep up with every detail that comes across in a 24 hour news cycle. New organizations have a habit of sensationalizing everything, to the point that it's difficult to filtrate out all of the unimportant information that they produce. The recent election in the US taught us that it's difficult to determine what information is really true and what's just one person's opinion. Misinformation has hit new heights in the United States, adding a new, unwelcome dimension to the process of following the news. This is complicated even more when you add in all of the texts, tweets, e-mails, and facebook feeds that fill up a person's news Now, not only does a person need to process the massive amount of news available, to get their information, but they also need to read everything with a suspicious, critical mind. 
Even if people try to stay up-to-date, the sheer amount of news out there seems to be overwhelming.

This is complicated even more when you add in all of the texts, tweets, e-mails, and facebook feeds that fill up a person's news Now, not only does a person need to process the massive amount of news available, to get their information, but they also need to read everything with a suspicious, critical mind. 
Even if people try to stay up-to-date, the sheer amount of news out there seems to be overwhelming.
 Differing opinions are the cornerstone of democracy, but today we have people purposefully filling news feeds with complete fabrications. In this day and age, news organizations are trying to fill the voids left behind by decline of investigative journalism. This is particularly dangerous to the citizens of the United States, where education has been a very low priority for many decades. This has left many people in the US without the ability to critically think about the world they live in.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

It's nearly impossible to keep up with every detail that comes across in a 24 hour news cycle. New organizations have a habit of sensationalizing everything, to the point that it's difficult to filtrate out all of the unimportant information that they produce.

This is complicated even more when you add in all of the texts, tweets, e-mails, and facebook feeds that fill up a person's news Now, not only does a person need to process the massive amount of news available, to get their information, but they also need to read everything with a suspicious, critical mind. 
Even if people try to stay up-to-date, the sheer amount of news out there seems to be overwhelming.
 Differing opinions are the cornerstone of democracy, but today we have people purposefully filling news feeds with complete fabrications. In this day and age, news organizations are trying to fill the voids left behind by decline of investigative journalism. This is particularly dangerous to the citizens of the United States, where education has been a very low priority for many decades. This has left many people in the US without the ability to critically think about the world they live in.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

Misinformation has hit new heights in the United States, adding a new, unwelcome dimension to the process of following the news. This is complicated even more when you add in all of the texts, tweets, e-mails, and facebook feeds that fill up a person's news Now, not only does a person need to process the massive amount of news available, to get their information, but they also need to read everything with a suspicious, critical mind.

 Differing opinions are the cornerstone of democracy, but today we have people purposefully filling news feeds with complete fabrications. In this day and age, news organizations are trying to fill the voids left behind by decline of investigative journalism.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

Misinformation has hit new heights in the United States, adding a new, unwelcome dimension to the process of following the news.

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions.

We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

It's nearly impossible to keep up with every detail that comes across in a 24 hour news cycle. New organizations have a habit of sensationalizing everything, to the point that it's difficult to filtrate out all of the unimportant information that they produce. The recent election in the US taught us that it's difficult to determine what information is really true and what's just one person's opinion. Misinformation has hit new heights in the United States, adding a new, unwelcome dimension to the process of following the news. This is complicated even more when you add in all of the texts, tweets, e-mails, and facebook feeds that fill up a person's news Now, not only does a person need to process the massive amount of news available, to get their information, but they also need to read everything with a suspicious, critical mind. 
Even if people try to stay up-to-date, the sheer amount of news out there seems to be overwhelming.
 Differing opinions are the cornerstone of democracy, but today we have people purposefully filling news feeds with complete fabrications. In this day and age, news organizations are trying to fill the voids left behind by decline of investigative journalism. This is particularly dangerous to the citizens of the United States, where education has been a very low priority for many decades. This has left many people in the US without the ability to critically think about the world they live in.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

It's nearly impossible to keep up with every detail that comes across in a 24 hour news cycle. New organizations have a habit of sensationalizing everything, to the point that it's difficult to filtrate out all of the unimportant information that they produce. The recent election in the US taught us that it's difficult to determine what information is really true and what's just one person's opinion. Misinformation has hit new heights in the United States, adding a new, unwelcome dimension to the process of following the news. This is complicated even more when you add in all of the texts, tweets, e-mails, and facebook feeds that fill up a person's news Now, not only does a person need to process the massive amount of news available, to get their information, but they also need to read everything with a suspicious, critical mind. 
Even if people try to stay up-to-date, the sheer amount of news out there seems to be overwhelming.
 Differing opinions are the cornerstone of democracy, but today we have people purposefully filling news feeds with complete fabrications. In this day and age, news organizations are trying to fill the voids left behind by decline of investigative journalism. This is particularly dangerous to the citizens of the United States, where education has been a very low priority for many decades.

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

It's nearly impossible to keep up with every detail that comes across in a 24 hour news cycle. New organizations have a habit of sensationalizing everything, to the point that it's difficult to filtrate out all of the unimportant information that they produce. The recent election in the US taught us that it's difficult to determine what information is really true and what's just one person's opinion. Misinformation has hit new heights in the United States, adding a new, unwelcome dimension to the process of following the news. This is complicated even more when you add in all of the texts, tweets, e-mails, and facebook feeds that fill up a person's news Now, not only does a person need to process the massive amount of news available, to get their information, but they also need to read everything with a suspicious, critical mind. 
Even if people try to stay up-to-date, the sheer amount of news out there seems to be overwhelming.
 Differing opinions are the cornerstone of democracy, but today we have people purposefully filling news feeds with complete fabrications. In this day and age, news organizations are trying to fill the voids left behind by decline of investigative journalism. This is particularly dangerous to the citizens of the United States, where education has been a very low priority for many decades.

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions.

 Differing opinions are the cornerstone of democracy, but today we have people purposefully filling news feeds with complete fabrications. In this day and age, news organizations are trying to fill the voids left behind by decline of investigative journalism. This is particularly dangerous to the citizens of the United States, where education has been a very low priority for many decades.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

It's nearly impossible to keep up with every detail that comes across in a 24 hour news cycle. New organizations have a habit of sensationalizing everything, to the point that it's difficult to filtrate out all of the unimportant information that they produce. The recent election in the US taught us that it's difficult to determine what information is really true and what's just one person's opinion. Misinformation has hit new heights in the United States, adding a new, unwelcome dimension to the process of following the news.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

It's nearly impossible to keep up with every detail that comes across in a 24 hour news cycle. New organizations have a habit of sensationalizing everything, to the point that it's difficult to filtrate out all of the unimportant information that they produce. The recent election in the US taught us that it's difficult to determine what information is really true and what's just one person's opinion. Misinformation has hit new heights in the United States, adding a new, unwelcome dimension to the process of following the news. This is complicated even more when you add in all of the texts, tweets, e-mails, and facebook feeds that fill up a person's news Now, not only does a person need to process the massive amount of news available, to get their information, but they also need to read everything with a suspicious, critical mind.

This is complicated even more when you add in all of the texts, tweets, e-mails, and facebook feeds that fill up a person's news Now, not only does a person need to process the massive amount of news available, to get their information, but they also need to read everything with a suspicious, critical mind. 
Even if people try to stay up-to-date, the sheer amount of news out there seems to be overwhelming.
 Differing opinions are the cornerstone of democracy, but today we have people purposefully filling news feeds with complete fabrications. In this day and age, news organizations are trying to fill the voids left behind by decline of investigative journalism. This is particularly dangerous to the citizens of the United States, where education has been a very low priority for many decades. This has left many people in the US without the ability to critically think about the world they live in.

As difficult as it is to obtain accurate information, we as citizens have a duty to try. We need to understand the reality of our society, before we can begin to look for ways to change it in positive ways.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

 Differing opinions are the cornerstone of democracy, but today we have people purposefully filling news feeds with complete fabrications. In this day and age, news organizations are trying to fill the voids left behind by decline of investigative journalism.

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

It's nearly impossible to keep up with every detail that comes across in a 24 hour news cycle. New organizations have a habit of sensationalizing everything, to the point that it's difficult to filtrate out all of the unimportant information that they produce.

Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

It's nearly impossible to keep up with every detail that comes across in a 24 hour news cycle. New organizations have a habit of sensationalizing everything, to the point that it's difficult to filtrate out all of the unimportant information that they produce. The recent election in the US taught us that it's difficult to determine what information is really true and what's just one person's opinion. Misinformation has hit new heights in the United States, adding a new, unwelcome dimension to the process of following the news. This is complicated even more when you add in all of the texts, tweets, e-mails, and facebook feeds that fill up a person's news Now, not only does a person need to process the massive amount of news available, to get their information, but they also need to read everything with a suspicious, critical mind. 
Even if people try to stay up-to-date, the sheer amount of news out there seems to be overwhelming.
 Differing opinions are the cornerstone of democracy, but today we have people purposefully filling news feeds with complete fabrications. In this day and age, news organizations are trying to fill the voids left behind by decline of investigative journalism. This is particularly dangerous to the citizens of the United States, where education has been a very low priority for many decades. This has left many people in the US without the ability to critically think about the world they live in.

As difficult as it is to obtain accurate information, we as citizens have a duty to try. We need to understand the reality of our society, before we can begin to look for ways to change it in positive ways. If we actively seek out the truth, but hold on to our skepticism, it doesn't matter if we don't catch every piece of news. We are, at the very least, consuming real information and not fabrication.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

It's nearly impossible to keep up with every detail that comes across in a 24 hour news cycle. New organizations have a habit of sensationalizing everything, to the point that it's difficult to filtrate out all of the unimportant information that they produce. The recent election in the US taught us that it's difficult to determine what information is really true and what's just one person's opinion. Misinformation has hit new heights in the United States, adding a new, unwelcome dimension to the process of following the news. This is complicated even more when you add in all of the texts, tweets, e-mails, and facebook feeds that fill up a person's news Now, not only does a person need to process the massive amount of news available, to get their information, but they also need to read everything with a suspicious, critical mind. 
Even if people try to stay up-to-date, the sheer amount of news out there seems to be overwhelming.
 Differing opinions are the cornerstone of democracy, but today we have people purposefully filling news feeds with complete fabrications. In this day and age, news organizations are trying to fill the voids left behind by decline of investigative journalism. This is particularly dangerous to the citizens of the United States, where education has been a very low priority for many decades. This has left many people in the US without the ability to critically think about the world they live in.

As difficult as it is to obtain accurate information, we as citizens have a duty to try. We need to understand the reality of our society, before we can begin to look for ways to change it in positive ways. If we actively seek out the truth, but hold on to our skepticism, it doesn't matter if we don't catch every piece of news. We are, at the very least, consuming real information and not fabrication.

In this day and age, news organizations are trying to fill the voids left behind by decline of investigative journalism. This is particularly dangerous to the citizens of the United States, where education has been a very low priority for many decades. This has left many people in the US without the ability to critically think about the world they live in.

As difficult as it is to obtain accurate information, we as citizens have a duty to try.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

It's nearly impossible to keep up with every detail that comes across in a 24 hour news cycle. New organizations have a habit of sensationalizing everything, to the point that it's difficult to filtrate out all of the unimportant information that they produce. The recent election in the US taught us that it's difficult to determine what information is really true and what's just one person's opinion. Misinformation has hit new heights in the United States, adding a new, unwelcome dimension to the process of following the news. This is complicated even more when you add in all of the texts, tweets, e-mails, and facebook feeds that fill up a person's news Now, not only does a person need to process the massive amount of news available, to get their information, but they also need to read everything with a suspicious, critical mind.

 Differing opinions are the cornerstone of democracy, but today we have people purposefully filling news feeds with complete fabrications. In this day and age, news organizations are trying to fill the voids left behind by decline of investigative journalism.

This has left many people in the US without the ability to critically think about the world they live in.

As difficult as it is to obtain accurate information, we as citizens have a duty to try.

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

It's nearly impossible to keep up with every detail that comes across in a 24 hour news cycle. New organizations have a habit of sensationalizing everything, to the point that it's difficult to filtrate out all of the unimportant information that they produce. The recent election in the US taught us that it's difficult to determine what information is really true and what's just one person's opinion. Misinformation has hit new heights in the United States, adding a new, unwelcome dimension to the process of following the news. This is complicated even more when you add in all of the texts, tweets, e-mails, and facebook feeds that fill up a person's news Now, not only does a person need to process the massive amount of news available, to get their information, but they also need to read everything with a suspicious, critical mind. 
Even if people try to stay up-to-date, the sheer amount of news out there seems to be overwhelming.
 Differing opinions are the cornerstone of democracy, but today we have people purposefully filling news feeds with complete fabrications. In this day and age, news organizations are trying to fill the voids left behind by decline of investigative journalism. This is particularly dangerous to the citizens of the United States, where education has been a very low priority for many decades. This has left many people in the US without the ability to critically think about the world they live in.

As difficult as it is to obtain accurate information, we as citizens have a duty to try. We need to understand the reality of our society, before we can begin to look for ways to change it in positive ways.

 Differing opinions are the cornerstone of democracy, but today we have people purposefully filling news feeds with complete fabrications. In this day and age, news organizations are trying to fill the voids left behind by decline of investigative journalism. This is particularly dangerous to the citizens of the United States, where education has been a very low priority for many decades. This has left many people in the US without the ability to critically think about the world they live in.

As difficult as it is to obtain accurate information, we as citizens have a duty to try. We need to understand the reality of our society, before we can begin to look for ways to change it in positive ways.

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

It's nearly impossible to keep up with every detail that comes across in a 24 hour news cycle. New organizations have a habit of sensationalizing everything, to the point that it's difficult to filtrate out all of the unimportant information that they produce. The recent election in the US taught us that it's difficult to determine what information is really true and what's just one person's opinion. Misinformation has hit new heights in the United States, adding a new, unwelcome dimension to the process of following the news. This is complicated even more when you add in all of the texts, tweets, e-mails, and facebook feeds that fill up a person's news Now, not only does a person need to process the massive amount of news available, to get their information, but they also need to read everything with a suspicious, critical mind. 
Even if people try to stay up-to-date, the sheer amount of news out there seems to be overwhelming.
 Differing opinions are the cornerstone of democracy, but today we have people purposefully filling news feeds with complete fabrications. In this day and age, news organizations are trying to fill the voids left behind by decline of investigative journalism. This is particularly dangerous to the citizens of the United States, where education has been a very low priority for many decades. This has left many people in the US without the ability to critically think about the world they live in.

As difficult as it is to obtain accurate information, we as citizens have a duty to try. We need to understand the reality of our society, before we can begin to look for ways to change it in positive ways.

This has left many people in the US without the ability to critically think about the world they live in.

As difficult as it is to obtain accurate information, we as citizens have a duty to try. We need to understand the reality of our society, before we can begin to look for ways to change it in positive ways.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

It's nearly impossible to keep up with every detail that comes across in a 24 hour news cycle. New organizations have a habit of sensationalizing everything, to the point that it's difficult to filtrate out all of the unimportant information that they produce. The recent election in the US taught us that it's difficult to determine what information is really true and what's just one person's opinion. Misinformation has hit new heights in the United States, adding a new, unwelcome dimension to the process of following the news. This is complicated even more when you add in all of the texts, tweets, e-mails, and facebook feeds that fill up a person's news Now, not only does a person need to process the massive amount of news available, to get their information, but they also need to read everything with a suspicious, critical mind. 
Even if people try to stay up-to-date, the sheer amount of news out there seems to be overwhelming.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

It's nearly impossible to keep up with every detail that comes across in a 24 hour news cycle. New organizations have a habit of sensationalizing everything, to the point that it's difficult to filtrate out all of the unimportant information that they produce. The recent election in the US taught us that it's difficult to determine what information is really true and what's just one person's opinion. Misinformation has hit new heights in the United States, adding a new, unwelcome dimension to the process of following the news. This is complicated even more when you add in all of the texts, tweets, e-mails, and facebook feeds that fill up a person's news Now, not only does a person need to process the massive amount of news available, to get their information, but they also need to read everything with a suspicious, critical mind. 
Even if people try to stay up-to-date, the sheer amount of news out there seems to be overwhelming.
 Differing opinions are the cornerstone of democracy, but today we have people purposefully filling news feeds with complete fabrications. In this day and age, news organizations are trying to fill the voids left behind by decline of investigative journalism. This is particularly dangerous to the citizens of the United States, where education has been a very low priority for many decades. This has left many people in the US without the ability to critically think about the world they live in.

As difficult as it is to obtain accurate information, we as citizens have a duty to try. We need to understand the reality of our society, before we can begin to look for ways to change it in positive ways.

We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

It's nearly impossible to keep up with every detail that comes across in a 24 hour news cycle.

Misinformation has hit new heights in the United States, adding a new, unwelcome dimension to the process of following the news. This is complicated even more when you add in all of the texts, tweets, e-mails, and facebook feeds that fill up a person's news Now, not only does a person need to process the massive amount of news available, to get their information, but they also need to read everything with a suspicious, critical mind.

 Differing opinions are the cornerstone of democracy, but today we have people purposefully filling news feeds with complete fabrications. In this day and age, news organizations are trying to fill the voids left behind by decline of investigative journalism. This is particularly dangerous to the citizens of the United States, where education has been a very low priority for many decades. This has left many people in the US without the ability to critically think about the world they live in.

As difficult as it is to obtain accurate information, we as citizens have a duty to try. We need to understand the reality of our society, before we can begin to look for ways to change it in positive ways. If we actively seek out the truth, but hold on to our skepticism, it doesn't matter if we don't catch every piece of news. We are, at the very least, consuming real information and not fabrication.

 Differing opinions are the cornerstone of democracy, but today we have people purposefully filling news feeds with complete fabrications.

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world.

 Differing opinions are the cornerstone of democracy, but today we have people purposefully filling news feeds with complete fabrications. In this day and age, news organizations are trying to fill the voids left behind by decline of investigative journalism. This is particularly dangerous to the citizens of the United States, where education has been a very low priority for many decades.

As difficult as it is to obtain accurate information, we as citizens have a duty to try.

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices.

This is complicated even more when you add in all of the texts, tweets, e-mails, and facebook feeds that fill up a person's news Now, not only does a person need to process the massive amount of news available, to get their information, but they also need to read everything with a suspicious, critical mind. 
Even if people try to stay up-to-date, the sheer amount of news out there seems to be overwhelming.
 Differing opinions are the cornerstone of democracy, but today we have people purposefully filling news feeds with complete fabrications. In this day and age, news organizations are trying to fill the voids left behind by decline of investigative journalism. This is particularly dangerous to the citizens of the United States, where education has been a very low priority for many decades. This has left many people in the US without the ability to critically think about the world they live in.

As difficult as it is to obtain accurate information, we as citizens have a duty to try. We need to understand the reality of our society, before we can begin to look for ways to change it in positive ways. If we actively seek out the truth, but hold on to our skepticism, it doesn't matter if we don't catch every piece of news. We are, at the very least, consuming real information and not fabrication.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.
