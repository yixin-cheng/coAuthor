What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters helpless women. I can't stand it when a woman is portrayed as weak and dependent on a man. I feel like we need more films and books that show strong women who can take care of themselves. A strong female lead character would be such an inspiration to young girls. These kinds of stories could carry messages about self-reliance, independence and empowerment. I think if one strong female lead is a success at the box office, we will start to see more of them. There could be an entire movement of strong female characters in film and literature. This could lead to a generation of newly-empowered females. A new wave of strong feminine energy could be on the horizon, and would be a great thing for society. We could soon have more female presidents , CEOs, and other powerful positions.
