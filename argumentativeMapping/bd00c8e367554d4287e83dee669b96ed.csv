Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide some kind of period supplies to students, especially teenagers who are experiencing menstrual cycles. If schools provide toilet paper, soap and Band-Aids, why not period products? They are a basic necessity as well. Adults are expected to provide their own supplies, which is fine. These are children, however. They are too young to be expected to be able to provide for themselves. That's why no one should fight having them freely available to students.

If schools provide toilet paper, soap and Band-Aids, why not period products? They are a basic necessity as well. Adults are expected to provide their own supplies, which is fine. These are children, however. They are too young to be expected to be able to provide for themselves. That's why no one should fight having them freely available to students. It would be no different than denying a student a Band-Aid. 

There's two reasons that they may not be provided. It would be funding or an issue with the school and parents thinking it is not appropriate. If it's about financial reasons, then the school district needs to make sure to make funding for something like this available. They are not expensive products. If huge amounts of money can be put into sports then there is money available for tampons. Another reason could be it is uncomfortable for parents.

These are children, however. They are too young to be expected to be able to provide for themselves. That's why no one should fight having them freely available to students. It would be no different than denying a student a Band-Aid. 

There's two reasons that they may not be provided. It would be funding or an issue with the school and parents thinking it is not appropriate. If it's about financial reasons, then the school district needs to make sure to make funding for something like this available. They are not expensive products. If huge amounts of money can be put into sports then there is money available for tampons. Another reason could be it is uncomfortable for parents. That's something that is awkward to discuss but it needs to happen. Ignoring an important, natural issue is not going to make it go away. The more awareness that is brought to periods, the more likely schools are going to start providing them.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide some kind of period supplies to students, especially teenagers who are experiencing menstrual cycles. If schools provide toilet paper, soap and Band-Aids, why not period products? They are a basic necessity as well. Adults are expected to provide their own supplies, which is fine. These are children, however. They are too young to be expected to be able to provide for themselves. That's why no one should fight having them freely available to students. It would be no different than denying a student a Band-Aid. 

There's two reasons that they may not be provided. It would be funding or an issue with the school and parents thinking it is not appropriate. If it's about financial reasons, then the school district needs to make sure to make funding for something like this available. They are not expensive products.

In my opinion, schools should provide some kind of period supplies to students, especially teenagers who are experiencing menstrual cycles. If schools provide toilet paper, soap and Band-Aids, why not period products? They are a basic necessity as well. Adults are expected to provide their own supplies, which is fine. These are children, however. They are too young to be expected to be able to provide for themselves. That's why no one should fight having them freely available to students. It would be no different than denying a student a Band-Aid. 

There's two reasons that they may not be provided. It would be funding or an issue with the school and parents thinking it is not appropriate. If it's about financial reasons, then the school district needs to make sure to make funding for something like this available. They are not expensive products. If huge amounts of money can be put into sports then there is money available for tampons. Another reason could be it is uncomfortable for parents. That's something that is awkward to discuss but it needs to happen. Ignoring an important, natural issue is not going to make it go away. The more awareness that is brought to periods, the more likely schools are going to start providing them.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, schools should provide some kind of period supplies to students, especially teenagers who are experiencing menstrual cycles. If schools provide toilet paper, soap and Band-Aids, why not period products? They are a basic necessity as well. Adults are expected to provide their own supplies, which is fine. These are children, however. They are too young to be expected to be able to provide for themselves. That's why no one should fight having them freely available to students.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide some kind of period supplies to students, especially teenagers who are experiencing menstrual cycles. If schools provide toilet paper, soap and Band-Aids, why not period products? They are a basic necessity as well. Adults are expected to provide their own supplies, which is fine. These are children, however. They are too young to be expected to be able to provide for themselves. That's why no one should fight having them freely available to students. It would be no different than denying a student a Band-Aid. 

There's two reasons that they may not be provided. It would be funding or an issue with the school and parents thinking it is not appropriate. If it's about financial reasons, then the school district needs to make sure to make funding for something like this available. They are not expensive products. If huge amounts of money can be put into sports then there is money available for tampons. Another reason could be it is uncomfortable for parents.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide some kind of period supplies to students, especially teenagers who are experiencing menstrual cycles. If schools provide toilet paper, soap and Band-Aids, why not period products? They are a basic necessity as well. Adults are expected to provide their own supplies, which is fine. These are children, however. They are too young to be expected to be able to provide for themselves. That's why no one should fight having them freely available to students. It would be no different than denying a student a Band-Aid. 

There's two reasons that they may not be provided. It would be funding or an issue with the school and parents thinking it is not appropriate. If it's about financial reasons, then the school district needs to make sure to make funding for something like this available. They are not expensive products. If huge amounts of money can be put into sports then there is money available for tampons. Another reason could be it is uncomfortable for parents. That's something that is awkward to discuss but it needs to happen. Ignoring an important, natural issue is not going to make it go away. The more awareness that is brought to periods, the more likely schools are going to start providing them.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide some kind of period supplies to students, especially teenagers who are experiencing menstrual cycles. If schools provide toilet paper, soap and Band-Aids, why not period products? They are a basic necessity as well. Adults are expected to provide their own supplies, which is fine. These are children, however. They are too young to be expected to be able to provide for themselves. That's why no one should fight having them freely available to students. It would be no different than denying a student a Band-Aid. 

There's two reasons that they may not be provided. It would be funding or an issue with the school and parents thinking it is not appropriate. If it's about financial reasons, then the school district needs to make sure to make funding for something like this available. They are not expensive products. If huge amounts of money can be put into sports then there is money available for tampons. Another reason could be it is uncomfortable for parents. That's something that is awkward to discuss but it needs to happen. Ignoring an important, natural issue is not going to make it go away.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide some kind of period supplies to students, especially teenagers who are experiencing menstrual cycles. If schools provide toilet paper, soap and Band-Aids, why not period products? They are a basic necessity as well. Adults are expected to provide their own supplies, which is fine. These are children, however. They are too young to be expected to be able to provide for themselves. That's why no one should fight having them freely available to students. It would be no different than denying a student a Band-Aid. 

There's two reasons that they may not be provided. It would be funding or an issue with the school and parents thinking it is not appropriate. If it's about financial reasons, then the school district needs to make sure to make funding for something like this available. They are not expensive products.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, schools should provide some kind of period supplies to students, especially teenagers who are experiencing menstrual cycles. If schools provide toilet paper, soap and Band-Aids, why not period products? They are a basic necessity as well. Adults are expected to provide their own supplies, which is fine. These are children, however. They are too young to be expected to be able to provide for themselves. That's why no one should fight having them freely available to students. It would be no different than denying a student a Band-Aid. 

There's two reasons that they may not be provided. It would be funding or an issue with the school and parents thinking it is not appropriate. If it's about financial reasons, then the school district needs to make sure to make funding for something like this available. They are not expensive products. If huge amounts of money can be put into sports then there is money available for tampons. Another reason could be it is uncomfortable for parents.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide some kind of period supplies to students, especially teenagers who are experiencing menstrual cycles. If schools provide toilet paper, soap and Band-Aids, why not period products? They are a basic necessity as well. Adults are expected to provide their own supplies, which is fine. These are children, however. They are too young to be expected to be able to provide for themselves. That's why no one should fight having them freely available to students. It would be no different than denying a student a Band-Aid. 

There's two reasons that they may not be provided. It would be funding or an issue with the school and parents thinking it is not appropriate. If it's about financial reasons, then the school district needs to make sure to make funding for something like this available. They are not expensive products. If huge amounts of money can be put into sports then there is money available for tampons. Another reason could be it is uncomfortable for parents. That's something that is awkward to discuss but it needs to happen. Ignoring an important, natural issue is not going to make it go away. The more awareness that is brought to periods, the more likely schools are going to start providing them.

We need to just make them available to students. We can overcome obstacles as long as we aren't ashamed to discuss this topic. It's not taboo. Schools can have open meetings to discuss it yearly so it eventually just becomes a normal, boring school topic. Just like the nurse's office, bathrooms, books and pencils.

It would be no different than denying a student a Band-Aid.

If huge amounts of money can be put into sports then there is money available for tampons. Another reason could be it is uncomfortable for parents. That's something that is awkward to discuss but it needs to happen. Ignoring an important, natural issue is not going to make it go away. The more awareness that is brought to periods, the more likely schools are going to start providing them.

If schools provide toilet paper, soap and Band-Aids, why not period products? They are a basic necessity as well. Adults are expected to provide their own supplies, which is fine. These are children, however. They are too young to be expected to be able to provide for themselves. That's why no one should fight having them freely available to students. It would be no different than denying a student a Band-Aid. 

There's two reasons that they may not be provided. It would be funding or an issue with the school and parents thinking it is not appropriate. If it's about financial reasons, then the school district needs to make sure to make funding for something like this available. They are not expensive products. If huge amounts of money can be put into sports then there is money available for tampons. Another reason could be it is uncomfortable for parents. That's something that is awkward to discuss but it needs to happen. Ignoring an important, natural issue is not going to make it go away. The more awareness that is brought to periods, the more likely schools are going to start providing them.

We need to just make them available to students. We can overcome obstacles as long as we aren't ashamed to discuss this topic. It's not taboo.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide some kind of period supplies to students, especially teenagers who are experiencing menstrual cycles. If schools provide toilet paper, soap and Band-Aids, why not period products? They are a basic necessity as well. Adults are expected to provide their own supplies, which is fine. These are children, however. They are too young to be expected to be able to provide for themselves. That's why no one should fight having them freely available to students. It would be no different than denying a student a Band-Aid. 

There's two reasons that they may not be provided. It would be funding or an issue with the school and parents thinking it is not appropriate. If it's about financial reasons, then the school district needs to make sure to make funding for something like this available. They are not expensive products. If huge amounts of money can be put into sports then there is money available for tampons. Another reason could be it is uncomfortable for parents. That's something that is awkward to discuss but it needs to happen. Ignoring an important, natural issue is not going to make it go away. The more awareness that is brought to periods, the more likely schools are going to start providing them.

We need to just make them available to students. We can overcome obstacles as long as we aren't ashamed to discuss this topic. It's not taboo. Schools can have open meetings to discuss it yearly so it eventually just becomes a normal, boring school topic. Just like the nurse's office, bathrooms, books and pencils. Treat it like anything else and it won't be such a big deal anymore. I think tha",user,30,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide some kind of period supplies to students, especially teenagers who are experiencing menstrual cycles. If schools provide toilet paper, soap and Band-Aids, why not period products? They are a basic necessity as well. Adults are expected to provide their own supplies, which is fine. These are children, however. They are too young to be expected to be able to provide for themselves. That's why no one should fight having them freely available to students. It would be no different than denying a student a Band-Aid. 

There's two reasons that they may not be provided. It would be funding or an issue with the school and parents thinking it is not appropriate. If it's about financial reasons, then the school district needs to make sure to make funding for something like this available. They are not expensive products. If huge amounts of money can be put into sports then there is money available for tampons. Another reason could be it is uncomfortable for parents.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide some kind of period supplies to students, especially teenagers who are experiencing menstrual cycles. If schools provide toilet paper, soap and Band-Aids, why not period products? They are a basic necessity as well. Adults are expected to provide their own supplies, which is fine. These are children, however. They are too young to be expected to be able to provide for themselves. That's why no one should fight having them freely available to students. It would be no different than denying a student a Band-Aid. 

There's two reasons that they may not be provided. It would be funding or an issue with the school and parents thinking it is not appropriate. If it's about financial reasons, then the school district needs to make sure to make funding for something like this available. They are not expensive products. If huge amounts of money can be put into sports then there is money available for tampons. Another reason could be it is uncomfortable for parents. That's something that is awkward to discuss but it needs to happen. Ignoring an important, natural issue is not going to make it go away.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide some kind of period supplies to students, especially teenagers who are experiencing menstrual cycles. If schools provide toilet paper, soap and Band-Aids, why not period products? They are a basic necessity as well. Adults are expected to provide their own supplies, which is fine. These are children, however. They are too young to be expected to be able to provide for themselves. That's why no one should fight having them freely available to students. It would be no different than denying a student a Band-Aid. 

There's two reasons that they may not be provided. It would be funding or an issue with the school and parents thinking it is not appropriate. If it's about financial reasons, then the school district needs to make sure to make funding for something like this available. They are not expensive products. If huge amounts of money can be put into sports then there is money available for tampons. Another reason could be it is uncomfortable for parents.
