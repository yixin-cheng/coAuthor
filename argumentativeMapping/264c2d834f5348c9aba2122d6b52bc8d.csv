In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. I believe that the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans and the chance to get a college education is enough.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. I believe that the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans and the chance to get a college education is enough. 
I believe that paying college athletes would ruin college sports.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. I believe that the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans and the chance to get a college education is enough. 
I believe that paying college athletes would ruin college sports.
 I believe that paying college athletes would cause a bidding war between colleges. Colleges would have to overpay for a handful of athletes, and have to cut funding for other activities.

I believe that paying college athletes would ruin college sports.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. I believe that the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans and the chance to get a college education is enough. 
I believe that paying college athletes would ruin college sports.
 I believe that paying college athletes would cause a bidding war between colleges. Colleges would have to overpay for a handful of athletes, and have to cut funding for other activities.

There would be no ""underdog with a chance to win"", no dark horses, just the haves, and the have-nots. We'd have a few super-programs who dominated everything due to their excessive cash-bought top talent.  The money would go to a select few athletes, leaving the rest of the team with less. In a society already dominated by money, we'd just be allowing another thing to become ""pay-to-win"".
IPying college athletes would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.
 Rural and poorer schools would have losing teams, harming the opportunities for motivation and success of some students.  There would be inequality in payment, and inequality in opportunity.  
The NCAA is a non-profit organization.
 It is a community of schools, and the athletes are part of that community. It returns all of its profits to the schools and the furthering of athletic programs. It works to keep schools a place of learning, not a place of money and greed. 
I believe that the NCAA is a great organization, and I believe that it should stay that way.

IPying college athletes would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.
 Rural and poorer schools would have losing teams, harming the opportunities for motivation and success of some students.  There would be inequality in payment, and inequality in opportunity.  
The NCAA is a non-profit organization.
 It is a community of schools, and the athletes are part of that community. It returns all of its profits to the schools and the furthering of athletic programs. It works to keep schools a place of learning, not a place of money and greed.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. I believe that the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans and the chance to get a college education is enough. 
I believe that paying college athletes would ruin college sports.
 I believe that paying college athletes would cause a bidding war between colleges. Colleges would have to overpay for a handful of athletes, and have to cut funding for other activities.

There would be no ""underdog with a chance to win"", no dark horses, just the haves, and the have-nots. We'd have a few super-programs who dominated everything due to their excessive cash-bought top talent.  The money would go to a select few athletes, leaving the rest of the team with less. In a society already dominated by money, we'd just be allowing another thing to become ""pay-to-win"".
IPying college athletes would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.
 Rural and poorer schools would have losing teams, harming the opportunities for motivation and success of some students.  There would be inequality in payment, and inequality in opportunity.  
The NCAA is a non-profit organization.
 It is a community of schools, and the athletes are part of that community. It returns all of its profits to the schools and the furthering of athletic programs. It works to keep schools a place of learning, not a place of money and greed.

I believe that paying college athletes would ruin college sports.
 I believe that paying college athletes would cause a bidding war between colleges. Colleges would have to overpay for a handful of athletes, and have to cut funding for other activities.

There would be no ""underdog with a chance to win"", no dark horses, just the haves, and the have-nots. We'd have a few super-programs who dominated everything due to their excessive cash-bought top talent.  The money would go to a select few athletes, leaving the rest of the team with less. In a society already dominated by money, we'd just be allowing another thing to become ""pay-to-win"".
IPying college athletes would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.
 Rural and poorer schools would have losing teams, harming the opportunities for motivation and success of some students.  There would be inequality in payment, and inequality in opportunity.  
The NCAA is a non-profit organization.
 It is a community of schools, and the athletes are part of that community. It returns all of its profits to the schools and the furthering of athletic programs. It works to keep schools a place of learning, not a place of money and business. 
I believe that the NCAA is a great organization, and I believe that it should stay that way.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. I believe that the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans, training with a pr and the chance to get a college education is enough. 
I believe that paying college athletes would ruin college sports.
 I believe that paying college athletes would cause a bidding war between colleges. Colleges would have to overpay for a handful of athletes, and have to cut funding for other activities.

There would be no ""underdog with a chance to win"", no dark horses, just the haves, and the have-nots. We'd have a few super-programs who dominated everything due to their excessive cash-bought top talent.  The money would go to a select few athletes, leaving the rest of the team with less. In a society already dominated by money, we'd just be allowing another thing to become ""pay-to-win"".
IPying college athletes would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.
 Rural and poorer schools would have losing teams, harming the opportunities for motivation and success of some students.  There would be inequality in payment, and inequality in opportunity.  
The NCAA is a non-profit organization.
 It is a community of schools, and the athletes are part of that community. It returns all of its profits to the schools and the furthering of athletic programs. It works to keep schools a place of learning, not a place of money and business.

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. I believe that the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans, training with a professional pro and the chance to get a college education is enough. 
I believe that paying college athletes would ruin college sports.
 I believe that paying college athletes would cause a bidding war between colleges. Colleges would have to overpay for a handful of athletes, and have to cut funding for other activities.

There would be no ""underdog with a chance to win"", no dark horses, just the haves, and the have-nots. We'd have a few super-programs who dominated everything due to their excessive cash-bought top talent.  The money would go to a select few athletes, leaving the rest of the team with less. In a society already dominated by money, we'd just be allowing another thing to become ""pay-to-win"".
IPying college athletes would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.
 Rural and poorer schools would have losing teams, harming the opportunities for motivation and success of some students.  There would be inequality in payment, and inequality in opportunity.  
The NCAA is a non-profit organization.
 It is a community of schools, and the athletes are part of that community. It returns all of its profits to the schools and the furthering of athletic programs. It works to keep schools a place of learning, not a place of money and business. 
I believe that the NCAA is a great organization, and I believe that it should stay that way.
 We should keep money and greed from destroying a good system. ",user,10,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. I believe that the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans, training with a professional program and t and the chance to get a college education is enough. 
I believe that paying college athletes would ruin college sports.
 I believe that paying college athletes would cause a bidding war between colleges. Colleges would have to overpay for a handful of athletes, and have to cut funding for other activities.

There would be no ""underdog with a chance to win"", no dark horses, just the haves, and the have-nots. We'd have a few super-programs who dominated everything due to their excessive cash-bought top talent.  The money would go to a select few athletes, leaving the rest of the team with less. In a society already dominated by money, we'd just be allowing another thing to become ""pay-to-win"".
IPying college athletes would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.
 Rural and poorer schools would have losing teams, harming the opportunities for motivation and success of some students.  There would be inequality in payment, and inequality in opportunity.
