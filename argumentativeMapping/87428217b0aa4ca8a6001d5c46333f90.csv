In my opinion, I think it is every person's choice whether or not they want to keep up with the news. It is part of our freedom to choose what we want to do with our time. I think it is important to know what is going on in the world, but I don't think it is necessary to watch the news every day.  It is not good to be completely unaware of events in the community.
