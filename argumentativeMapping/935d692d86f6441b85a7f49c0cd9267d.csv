Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, whether a sport is reasonable or not depends on the purpose, goals and motives of the participants. Those who participate in the sport purely for recreation or adrenaline may promote a rationale for doing dangerous activities like skydiving, rock climbing or ski jumping, But what is the goal of the sport?  What defines winning? What defines losing? How do the rules determine what's fair and what's unfair? It all seems a bit pretentious, even if it's a thrill -- not to mention expensive -- to hurtle oneself off a high cliff or summit if there is not a clearly-defined way of doing it well or poorly, or right or wrong.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, whether a sport is reasonable or not depends on the purpose, goals and motives of the participants. Those who participate in the sport purely for recreation or adrenaline may promote a rationale for doing dangerous activities like skydiving, rock climbing or ski jumping, But what is the goal of the sport?  What defines winning? What defines losing? How do the rules determine what's fair and what's unfair? It all seems a bit pretentious, even if it's a thrill -- not to mention expensive -- to hurtle oneself off a high cliff or summit if there is not a clearly-defined way of doing it well or poorly, or right or wrong. 
But if the goal of the sport is to achieve a specific outcome that has not yet been achieved, as in trying to travel farther or higher

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, whether a sport is reasonable or not depends on the purpose, goals and motives of the participants. Those who participate in the sport purely for recreation or adrenaline may promote a rationale for doing dangerous activities like skydiving, rock climbing or ski jumping, But what is the goal of the sport?  What defines winning? What defines losing? How do the rules determine what's fair and what's unfair? It all seems a bit pretentious, even if it's a thrill -- not to mention expensive -- to hurtle oneself off a high cliff or summit if there is not a clearly-defined way of doing it well or poorly, or right or wrong. 
But if the goal of the sport is to achieve a specific outcome that has not yet been achieved, as in trying to travel farther or higher

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, whether a sport is reasonable or not depends on the purpose, goals and motives of the participants. Those who participate in the sport purely for recreation or adrenaline may promote a rationale for doing dangerous activities like skydiving, rock climbing or ski jumping, But what is the goal of the sport?  What defines winning? What defines losing? How do the rules determine what's fair and what's unfair? It all seems a bit pretentious, even if it's a thrill -- not to mention expensive -- to hurtle oneself off a high cliff or summit if there is not a clearly-defined way of doing it well or poorly, or right or wrong. 
But if the goal of the sport is to achieve a specific outcome that has not yet been achieved, as in trying to travel farther or higher
, that increases the risk of someone getting hurt or damaging something. Reckless and irresponsible behavior is condoned if the consequences are not likely to extend beyond the individual(s) who are participating. Is that selfish when the sport can clearly be categorized as dangerous? I think so. Reckless behavior goes against the concept and principles in sport, which is honor, integrity, fairness and respect. Acting responsibly is something that should be frowned up, especially in competition.  ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Those who participate in the sport purely for recreation or adrenaline may promote a rationale for doing dangerous activities like skydiving, rock climbing or ski jumping, But what is the goal of the sport?  What defines winning? What defines losing? How do the rules determine what's fair and what's unfair? It all seems a bit pretentious, even if it's a thrill -- not to mention expensive -- to hurtle oneself off a high cliff or summit if there is not a clearly-defined way of doing it well or poorly, or right or wrong.

Is that selfish when the sport can clearly be categorized as dangerous? I think so. Reckless behavior goes against the concept and principles in sport, which is honor, integrity, fairness and respect. Acting responsibly is something that should be frowned up, especially in competition.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, whether a sport is reasonable or not depends on the purpose, goals and motives of the participants. Those who participate in the sport purely for recreation or adrenaline may promote a rationale for doing dangerous activities like skydiving, rock climbing or ski jumping, But what is the goal of the sport?  What defines winning? What defines losing? How do the rules determine what's fair and what's unfair? It all seems a bit pretentious, even if it's a thrill -- not to mention expensive -- to hurtle oneself off a high cliff or summit if there is not a clearly-defined way of doing it well or poorly, or right or wrong. 
But if the goal of the sport is to achieve a specific outcome that has not yet been achieved, as in trying to travel farther or higher
, that increases the risk of someone getting hurt or damaging something. Reckless and irresponsible behavior is condoned if the consequences are not likely to extend beyond the individual(s) who are participating. Is that selfish when the sport can clearly be categorized as dangerous? I think so. Reckless behavior goes against the concept and principles in sport, which is honor, integrity, fairness and respect. Acting responsibly is something that should be frowned up, especially in competition.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, whether a sport is reasonable or not depends on the purpose, goals and motives of the participants. Those who participate in the sport purely for recreation or adrenaline may promote a rationale for doing dangerous activities like skydiving, rock climbing or ski jumping, But what is the goal of the sport?  What defines winning? What defines losing? How do the rules determine what's fair and what's unfair? It all seems a bit pretentious, even if it's a thrill -- not to mention expensive -- to hurtle oneself off a high cliff or summit if there is not a clearly-defined way of doing it well or poorly, or right or wrong. 
But if the goal of the sport is to achieve a specific outcome that has not yet been achieved, as in trying to travel farther or higher
, that increases the risk of someone getting hurt or damaging something. Reckless and irresponsible behavior is condoned if the consequences are not likely to extend beyond the individual(s) who are participating. Is that selfish when the sport can clearly be categorized as dangerous? I think so. Reckless behavior goes against the concept and principles in sport, which is honor, integrity, fairness and respect. Acting responsibly is something that should be frowned up, especially in competition.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, whether a sport is reasonable or not depends on the purpose, goals and motives of the participants. Those who participate in the sport purely for recreation or adrenaline may promote a rationale for doing dangerous activities like skydiving, rock climbing or ski jumping, But what is the goal of the sport?  What defines winning? What defines losing? How do the rules determine what's fair and what's unfair? It all seems a bit pretentious, even if it's a thrill -- not to mention expensive -- to hurtle oneself off a high cliff or summit if there is not a clearly-defined way of doing it well or poorly, or right or wrong. 
But if the goal of the sport is to achieve a specific outcome that has not yet been achieved, as in trying to travel farther or higher
, that increases the risk of someone getting hurt or damaging something. Reckless and irresponsible behavior is condoned if the consequences are not likely to extend beyond the individual(s) who are participating. Is that selfish when the sport can clearly be categorized as dangerous? I think so. Reckless behavior goes against the concept and principles in sport, which is honor, integrity, fairness and respect. Acting responsibly is something that should be frowned up, especially in competition.  
Sports teach much in the way of values, or principles that can help us to determine how we should live our lives.
 That is why we should aim to label activities as sports only if they promote or sustain the value of sports. Ot",user,18,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, whether a sport is reasonable or not depends on the purpose, goals and motives of the participants. Those who participate in the sport purely for recreation or adrenaline may promote a rationale for doing dangerous activities like skydiving, rock climbing or ski jumping, But what is the goal of the sport?  What defines winning? What defines losing? How do the rules determine what's fair and what's unfair? It all seems a bit pretentious, even if it's a thrill -- not to mention expensive -- to hurtle oneself off a high cliff or summit if there is not a clearly-defined way of doing it well or poorly, or right or wrong.

Reckless and irresponsible behavior is condoned if the consequences are not likely to extend beyond the individual(s) who are participating. Is that selfish when the sport can clearly be categorized as dangerous? I think so. Reckless behavior goes against the concept and principles in sport, which is honor, integrity, fairness and respect. Acting responsibly is something that should be frowned up, especially in competition.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, whether a sport is reasonable or not depends on the purpose, goals and motives of the participants. Those who participate in the sport purely for recreation or adrenaline may promote a rationale for doing dangerous activities like skydiving, rock climbing or ski jumping, But what is the goal of the sport?  What defines winning? What defines losing? How do the rules determine what's fair and what's unfair? It all seems a bit pretentious, even if it's a thrill -- not to mention expensive -- to hurtle oneself off a high cliff or summit if there is not a clearly-defined way of doing it well or poorly, or right or wrong.

Reckless and irresponsible behavior is condoned if the consequences are not likely to extend beyond the individual(s) who are participating.
