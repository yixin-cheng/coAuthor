In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful.

Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower leveThe NCAA is a stepping stone for these athletes, and it is unfair to them to not pay them for their work.

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level?

 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level?

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example.

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level? The NCAA is a stepping stone for these athletes, and it is unfair to them to not compensate them for their performance and efforts.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level? The NCAA is a stepping stone for these athletes, and it is unfair to them to not compensate them for their performance and efforts.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level? The NCAA is a stepping stone for these athletes, and it is unfair to them to not compensate them for their performance and efforts.

They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level? The NCAA is a stepping stone for these athletes, and it is unfair to them to not compensate them for their performance and efforts.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level? The NCAA is a stepping stone for these athletes, and it is unfair to them to not compensate them for their performance and efforts.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level? The NCAA is a stepping stone for these athletes, and it is unfair to them to not compensate them for their performance and efforts.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example.

They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful.

 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level?

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level? The NCAA is a stepping stone for these athletes, and it is unfair to them to not compensate them for their performance and efforts.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level? The NCAA is a stepping stone for these athletes, and it is unfair to them to not compensate them for their performance and efforts.

They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful.

Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level? The NCAA is a stepping stone for these athletes, and it is unfair to them to not compensate them for their performance and efforts.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level? The NCAA is a stepping stone for these athletes, and it is unfair to them to not compensate them for their performance and efforts.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level? The NCAA is a stepping stone for these athletes, and it is unfair to them to not compensate them for their performance and efforts.

Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level?

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level?

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level? The NCAA is a stepping stone for these athletes, and it is unfair to them to not compensate them for their performance and efforts.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level? The NCAA is a stepping stone for these athletes, and it is unfair to them to not compensate them for their performance and efforts.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level?

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level?

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.

 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level?

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level? The NCAA is a stepping stone for these athletes, and it is unfair to them to not compensate them for their performance and efforts.

Even in athletics, the principles of workers' rights still apply. College athletes are not just students; they are entertainers, professionals, public figures, and ultimately workers.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level? The NCAA is a stepping stone for these athletes, and it is unfair to them to not compensate them for their performance and efforts.

Even in athletics, the principles of workers' rights still apply. College athletes are not just students; they are entertainers, professionals, public figures, and ultimately workers. Their lives revolve around being in top physique so they can play for their universities the same way that major league players would.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level? The NCAA is a stepping stone for these athletes, and it is unfair to them to not compensate them for their performance and efforts.

Even in athletics, the principles of workers' rights still apply. College athletes are not just students; they are entertainers, professionals, public figures, and ultimately workers.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level? The NCAA is a stepping stone for these athletes, and it is unfair to them to not compensate them for their performance and efforts.

Even in athletics, the principles of workers' rights still apply. College athletes are not just students; they are entertainers, professionals, public figures, and ultimately workers.

 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level?

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level? The NCAA is a stepping stone for these athletes, and it is unfair to them to not compensate them for their performance and efforts.

Even in athletics, the principles of workers' rights still apply. College athletes are not just students; they are entertainers, professionals, public figures, and ultimately workers.

Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level? The NCAA is a stepping stone for these athletes, and it is unfair to them to not compensate them for their performance and efforts.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities.
