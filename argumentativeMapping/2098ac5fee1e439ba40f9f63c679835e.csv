In my opinion, college athletes should be paid.  At the root of this belief is the fact that they are risking their health and thus their future by participating in high-risk sports like football.    Even if a college athlete is lucky enough to stay healthy, they can still sustain life-long injuries and be unable to pursue any other career path.   The concussion syndrome linked to contact sports like football is a prime example.

College athletics has become a huge money machine.  Big sports program schools have been willing and have paid top dollar for a few select athletes so that is not going to change.  College athletes should be given the opportunity to receive compensation as well.

The way to resolve this is to make college sports just that college sports.  The focus of a college should be education, sports is what is done in free time from studies.  After all, there is no college curriculum for 'pro football player', no degrees are offered for 'professional athlete'.  College athletics was never meant to provide a career.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid.  At the root of this belief is the fact that they are risking their health and thus their future by participating in high-risk sports like football.    Even if a college athlete is lucky enough to stay healthy, they can still sustain life-long injuries and be unable to pursue any other career path.   The concussion syndrome linked to contact sports like football is a prime example.

College athletics has become a huge money machine.  Big sports program schools have been willing and have paid top dollar for a few select athletes so that is not going to change.  College athletes should be given the opportunity to receive compensation as well.

The way to resolve this is to make college sports just that college sports.  The focus of a college should be education, sports is what is done in free time from studies.  After all, there is no college curriculum for 'pro football player', no degrees are offered for 'professional athlete'.  College athletics was never meant to provide a career.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid.  At the root of this belief is the fact that they are risking their health and thus their future by participating in high-risk sports like football.    Even if a college athlete is lucky enough to stay healthy, they can still sustain life-long injuries and be unable to pursue any other career path.   The concussion syndrome linked to contact sports like football is a prime example.

College athletics has become a huge money machine.  Big sports program schools have been willing and have paid top dollar for a few select athletes so that is not going to change.  College athletes should be given the opportunity to receive compensation as well.

The way to resolve this is to make college sports just that college sports.  The focus of a college should be education, sports is what is done in free time from studies.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid.  At the root of this belief is the fact that they are risking their health and thus their future by participating in high-risk sports like football.    Even if a college athlete is lucky enough to stay healthy, they can still sustain life-long injuries and be unable to pursue any other career path.   The concussion syndrome linked to contact sports like football is a prime example.

College athletics has become a huge money machine.  Big sports program schools have been willing and have paid top dollar for a few select athletes so that is not going to change.  College athletes should be given the opportunity to receive compensation as well.

The way to resolve this is to make college sports just that college sports.  The focus of a college should be education, sports is what is done in free time from studies.  After all, there is no college curriculum for 'pro football player', no degrees are offered for 'professional athlete'.  College athletics was never meant to provide a career.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid.  At the root of this belief is the fact that they are risking their health and thus their future by participating in high-risk sports like football.    Even if a college athlete is lucky enough to stay healthy, they can still sustain life-long injuries and be unable to pursue any other career path.   The concussion syndrome linked to contact sports like football is a prime example.

College athletics has become a huge money machine.  Big sports program schools have been willing and have paid top dollar for a few select athletes so that is not going to change.  College athletes should be given the opportunity to receive compensation as well.

The way to resolve this is to make college sports just that college sports.  The focus of a college should be education, sports is what is done in free time from studies.  After all, there is no college curriculum for 'pro football player', no degrees are offered for 'professional athlete'.  College athletics was never meant to provide a career.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid.  At the root of this belief is the fact that they are risking their health and thus their future by participating in high-risk sports like football.    Even if a college athlete is lucky enough to stay healthy, they can still sustain life-long injuries and be unable to pursue any other career path.   The concussion syndrome linked to contact sports like football is a prime example.

College athletics has become a huge money machine.  Big sports program schools have been willing and have paid top dollar for a few select athletes so that is not going to change.  College athletes should be given the opportunity to receive compensation as well.

The way to resolve this is to make college sports just that college sports.  The focus of a college should be education, sports is what is done in free time from studies.  After all, there is no college curriculum for 'pro football player', no degrees are offered for 'professional athlete'.  College athletics was never meant to provide a career.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid.  At the root of this belief is the fact that they are risking their health and thus their future by participating in high-risk sports like football.    Even if a college athlete is lucky enough to stay healthy, they can still sustain life-long injuries and be unable to pursue any other career path.   The concussion syndrome linked to contact sports like football is a prime example.

College athletics has become a huge money machine.  Big sports program schools have been willing and have paid top dollar for a few select athletes so that is not going to change.  College athletes should be given the opportunity to receive compensation as well.

The way to resolve this is to make college sports just that college sports.  The focus of a college should be education, sports is what is done in free time from studies.  After all, there is no college curriculum for 'pro football player', no degrees are offered for 'professional athlete'.  College athletics was never meant to provide a career.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid.  At the root of this belief is the fact that they are risking their health and thus their future by participating in high-risk sports like football.    Even if a college athlete is lucky enough to stay healthy, they can still sustain life-long injuries and be unable to pursue any other career path.   The concussion syndrome linked to contact sports like football is a prime example.

College athletics has become a huge money machine.  Big sports program schools have been willing and have paid top dollar for a few select athletes so that is not going to change.  College athletes should be given the opportunity to receive compensation as well.

The way to resolve this is to make college sports just that college sports.  The focus of a college should be education, sports is what is done in free time from studies.  After all, there is no college curriculum for 'pro football player', no degrees are offered for 'professional athlete'.  College athletics was never meant to provide a career.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid.  At the root of this belief is the fact that they are risking their health and thus their future by participating in high-risk sports like football.    Even if a college athlete is lucky enough to stay healthy, they can still sustain life-long injuries and be unable to pursue any other career path.   The concussion syndrome linked to contact sports like football is a prime example.

College athletics has become a huge money machine.  Big sports program schools have been willing and have paid top dollar for a few select athletes so that is not going to change.  College athletes should be given the opportunity to receive compensation as well.

The way to resolve this is to make college sports just that college sports.  The focus of a college should be education, sports is what is done in free time from studies.  After all, there is no college curriculum for 'pro football player', no degrees are offered for 'professional athlete'.  College athletics was never meant to provide a career.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid.  At the root of this belief is the fact that they are risking their health and thus their future by participating in high-risk sports like football.    Even if a college athlete is lucky enough to stay healthy, they can still sustain life-long injuries and be unable to pursue any other career path.   The concussion syndrome linked to contact sports like football is a prime example.

College athletics has become a huge money machine.  Big sports program schools have been willing and have paid top dollar for a few select athletes so that is not going to change.  College athletes should be given the opportunity to receive compensation as well.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid.  At the root of this belief is the fact that they are risking their health and thus their future by participating in high-risk sports like football.    Even if a college athlete is lucky enough to stay healthy, they can still sustain life-long injuries and be unable to pursue any other career path.   The concussion syndrome linked to contact sports like football is a prime example.

College athletics has become a huge money machine.  Big sports program schools have been willing and have paid top dollar for a few select athletes so that is not going to change.  College athletes should be given the opportunity to receive compensation as well.

The way to resolve this is to make college sports just that college sports.  The focus of a college should be education, sports is what is done in free time from studies.  After all, there is no college curriculum for 'pro football player', no degrees are offered for 'professional athlete'.  College athletics was never meant to provide a career.

For those whose focus is a career in professional sports there should be a junior league much as baseball has the minor leagues.  Education should be provided in the areas that would most benefit a professional athlete, like money management, etc.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid.  At the root of this belief is the fact that they are risking their health and thus their future by participating in high-risk sports like football.    Even if a college athlete is lucky enough to stay healthy, they can still sustain life-long injuries and be unable to pursue any other career path.   The concussion syndrome linked to contact sports like football is a prime example.

College athletics has become a huge money machine.  Big sports program schools have been willing and have paid top dollar for a few select athletes so that is not going to change.  College athletes should be given the opportunity to receive compensation as well.

The way to resolve this is to make college sports just that college sports.  The focus of a college should be education, sports is what is done in free time from studies.  After all, there is no college curriculum for 'pro football player', no degrees are offered for 'professional athlete'.  College athletics was never meant to provide a career.

For those whose focus is a career in professional sports there should be a junior league much as baseball has the minor leagues.  Education should be provided in the areas that would most benefit a professional athlete, like money management, etc.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid.  At the root of this belief is the fact that they are risking their health and thus their future by participating in high-risk sports like football.    Even if a college athlete is lucky enough to stay healthy, they can still sustain life-long injuries and be unable to pursue any other career path.   The concussion syndrome linked to contact sports like football is a prime example.

College athletics has become a huge money machine.  Big sports program schools have been willing and have paid top dollar for a few select athletes so that is not going to change.  College athletes should be given the opportunity to receive compensation as well.

The way to resolve this is to make college sports just that college sports.  The focus of a college should be education, sports is what is done in free time from studies.  After all, there is no college curriculum for 'pro football player', no degrees are offered for 'professional athlete'.  College athletics was never meant to provide a career.

For those whose focus is a career in professional sports there should be a junior league much as baseball has the minor leagues.  Education should be provided in the areas that would most benefit a professional athlete, like money management, etc.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid.  At the root of this belief is the fact that they are risking their health and thus their future by participating in high-risk sports like football.    Even if a college athlete is lucky enough to stay healthy, they can still sustain life-long injuries and be unable to pursue any other career path.   The concussion syndrome linked to contact sports like football is a prime example.

College athletics has become a huge money machine.  Big sports program schools have been willing and have paid top dollar for a few select athletes so that is not going to change.  College athletes should be given the opportunity to receive compensation as well.

The way to resolve this is to make college sports just that college sports.  The focus of a college should be education, sports is what is done in free time from studies.  After all, there is no college curriculum for 'pro football player', no degrees are offered for 'professional athlete'.  College athletics was never meant to provide a career.

For those whose focus is a career in professional sports there should be a junior league much as baseball has the minor leagues.  Education should be provided in the areas that would most benefit a professional athlete, like money management, etc.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid.  At the root of this belief is the fact that they are risking their health and thus their future by participating in high-risk sports like football.    Even if a college athlete is lucky enough to stay healthy, they can still sustain life-long injuries and be unable to pursue any other career path.   The concussion syndrome linked to contact sports like football is a prime example.

College athletics has become a huge money machine.  Big sports program schools have been willing and have paid top dollar for a few select athletes so that is not going to change.  College athletes should be given the opportunity to receive compensation as well.

The way to resolve this is to make college sports just that college sports.  The focus of a college should be education, sports is what is done in free time from studies.  After all, there is no college curriculum for 'pro football player', no degrees are offered for 'professional athlete'.  College athletics was never meant to provide a career.

For those whose focus is a career in professional sports there should be a junior league much as baseball has the minor leagues.  Education should be provided in the areas that would most benefit a professional athlete, like money management, etc.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid.  At the root of this belief is the fact that they are risking their health and thus their future by participating in high-risk sports like football.    Even if a college athlete is lucky enough to stay healthy, they can still sustain life-long injuries and be unable to pursue any other career path.   The concussion syndrome linked to contact sports like football is a prime example.

College athletics has become a huge money machine.  Big sports program schools have been willing and have paid top dollar for a few select athletes so that is not going to change.  College athletes should be given the opportunity to receive compensation as well.

The way to resolve this is to make college sports just that college sports.  The focus of a college should be education, sports is what is done in free time from studies.  After all, there is no college curriculum for 'pro football player', no degrees are offered for 'professional athlete'.  College athletics was never meant to provide a career.

For those whose focus is a career in professional sports there should be a junior league much as baseball has the minor leagues.  Education should be provided in the areas that would most benefit a professional athlete, like money management, etc.
