In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school is discipline and being responsible for my own actions. School teaches us many important subjects such as math, English, history, etc but discipline is the one that sticks with me the most.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school is discipline and being responsible for my own actions. School teaches us many important subjects such as math, English, history, etc but discipline is the one that sticks with me the most.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school is discipline and being responsible for my own actions. School teaches us many important subjects such as math, English, history, etc but discipline is the one that sticks with me the most.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students no",user,17,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some",user,18,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school is discipline and being responsible for my own actions. School teaches us many important subjects such as math, English, history, etc but discipline is the one that sticks with me the most.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school is discipline and being responsible for my own actions. School teaches us many important subjects such as math, English, history, etc but discipline is the one that sticks with me the most.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school is discipline and being responsible for my own actions. School teaches us many important subjects such as math, English, history, etc but discipline is the one that sticks with me the most.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science.

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science. That type of passion can lead you the right way and set the foundation of what your adult life is going to be.

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science. That type of passion can lead you the right way and set the foundation of what your adult life is going to be.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science. That type of passion can lead you the right way and set the foundation of what your adult life is going to be.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school is discipline and being responsible for my own actions. School teaches us many important subjects such as math, English, history, etc but discipline is the one that sticks with me the most.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science. That type of passion can lead you the right way and set the foundation of what your adult life is going to be.

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science. That type of passion can lead you the right way and set the foundation of what your adult life is going to be.

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science. That type of passion can lead you the right way and set the foundation of what your adult life is going to be.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school is discipline and being responsible for my own actions. School teaches us many important subjects such as math, English, history, etc but discipline is the one that sticks with me the most.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science. That type of passion can lead you the right way and set the foundation of what your adult life is going to be.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school is discipline and being responsible for my own actions. School teaches us many important subjects such as math, English, history, etc but discipline is the one that sticks with me the most.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school is discipline and being responsible for my own actions. School teaches us many important subjects such as math, English, history, etc but discipline is the one that sticks with me the most.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science. That type of passion can lead you the right way and set the foundation of what your adult life is going to be.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school is discipline and being responsible for my own actions. School teaches us many important subjects such as math, English, history, etc but discipline is the one that sticks with me the most.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science. That type of passion can lead you the right way and set the foundation of what your adult life is going to be.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science. That type of passion can lead you the right way and set the foundation of what your adult life is going to be.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school is discipline and being responsible for my own actions. School teaches us many important subjects such as math, English, history, etc but discipline is the one that sticks with me the most.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science. That type of passion can lead you the right way and set the foundation of what your adult life is going to be.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school is discipline and being responsible for my own actions. School teaches us many important subjects such as math, English, history, etc but discipline is the one that sticks with me the most.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science. That type of passion can lead you the right way and set the foundation of what your adult life is going to be.

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science. That type of passion can lead you the right way and set the foundation of what your adult life is going to be.

When I was in High School, I knew for a fact that I wanted a job that was going to involve technology and computers. Fast forward 10-15 years and that's exactly what I'm doing. I work as a technical support Manager at a web hosting company where I solve technical issues for customers.

When I was in High School, I knew for a fact that I wanted a job that was going to involve technology and computers. Fast forward 10-15 years and that's exactly what I'm doing. I work as a technical support Manager at a web hosting company where I solve technical issues for customers.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school is discipline and being responsible for my own actions. School teaches us many important subjects such as math, English, history, etc but discipline is the one that sticks with me the most.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science. That type of passion can lead you the right way and set the foundation of what your adult life is going to be.

When I was in High School, I knew for a fact that I wanted a job that was going to involve technology and computers. Fast forward 10-15 years and that's exactly what I'm doing. I work as a technical support Manager at a web hosting company where I solve technical issues for customers.

When I was in High School, I knew for a fact that I wanted a job that was going to involve technology and computers. Fast forward 10-15 years and that's exactly what I'm doing. I work as a technical support Manager at a web hosting company where I solve technical issues for customers.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school is discipline and being responsible for my own actions. School teaches us many important subjects such as math, English, history, etc but discipline is the one that sticks with me the most.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school is discipline and being responsible for my own actions. School teaches us many important subjects such as math, English, history, etc but discipline is the one that sticks with me the most.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science. That type of passion can lead you the right way and set the foundation of what your adult life is going to be.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school is discipline and being responsible for my own actions. School teaches us many important subjects such as math, English, history, etc but discipline is the one that sticks with me the most.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science. That type of passion can lead you the right way and set the foundation of what your adult life is going to be.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school is discipline and being responsible for my own actions. School teaches us many important subjects such as math, English, history, etc but discipline is the one that sticks with me the most.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science.

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school is discipline and being responsible for my own actions. School teaches us many important subjects such as math, English, history, etc but discipline is the one that sticks with me the most.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science. That type of passion can lead you the right way and set the foundation of what your adult life is going to be.

When I was in High School, I knew for a fact that I wanted a job that was going to involve technology and computers. Fast forward 10-15 years and that's exactly what I'm doing. I work as a technical support Manager at a web hosting company where I solve technical issues for customers. 

I combined my passion, discipline and pride to move right up the ladder and get a dream job. The great thing is that there is nothing st",user,24,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school is discipline and being responsible for my own actions. School teaches us many important subjects such as math, English, history, etc but discipline is the one that sticks with me the most.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science. That type of passion can lead you the right way and set the foundation of what your adult life is going to be.

When I was in High School, I knew for a fact that I wanted a job that was going to involve technology and computers. Fast forward 10-15 years and that's exactly what I'm doing. I work as a technical support Manager at a web hosting company where I solve technical issues for customers.
