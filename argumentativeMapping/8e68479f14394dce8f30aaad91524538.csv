In my opinion, the stereotypical dumb blonde character makes me cringe. I think this character has been over used and is demoralizing to women. I have seen this character in many movies and television shows. I think it cheapens the show and is not at all realistic. If I see the ""dumb blonde"" in a show, it makes me less likely to want to watch it. 

I find this stereotype is not at all realistic and is really just another way to put women down. I think it is important to have strong female characters in movies and television shows. The stereotype of dumb blondes and women staying home to take care of a family and home is one that should be done away with. Times have changed. Women can be strong, independent and intelligent. This is what television shows should be portraying now. How are we going to teach children that women can do whatever they set their mind to if television shows are constantly portraying them in a negative light? 

The dumb blonde character is often also portrayed as sexy. This is another stereotype that I find offensive. Do we still have to use a pretty woman or sex to get people to watch a show?

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical dumb blonde character makes me cringe. I think this character has been over used and is demoralizing to women. I have seen this character in many movies and television shows. I think it cheapens the show and is not at all realistic. If I see the ""dumb blonde"" in a show, it makes me less likely to want to watch it. 

I find this stereotype is not at all realistic and is really just another way to put women down. I think it is important to have strong female characters in movies and television shows. The stereotype of dumb blondes and women staying home to take care of a family and home is one that should be done away with. Times have changed. Women can be strong, independent and intelligent. This is what television shows should be portraying now. How are we going to teach children that women can do whatever they set their mind to if television shows are constantly portraying them in a negative light? 

The dumb blonde character is often also portrayed as sexy. This is another stereotype that I find offensive. Do we still have to use a pretty woman or sex to get people to watch a show? I think that television shows and movies should be more about the story line than what the characters look like.

I have seen this character in many movies and television shows. I think it cheapens the show and is not at all realistic. If I see the ""dumb blonde"" in a show, it makes me less likely to want to watch it. 

I find this stereotype is not at all realistic and is really just another way to put women down. I think it is important to have strong female characters in movies and television shows. The stereotype of dumb blondes and women staying home to take care of a family and home is one that should be done away with. Times have changed. Women can be strong, independent and intelligent. This is what television shows should be portraying now. How are we going to teach children that women can do whatever they set their mind to if television shows are constantly portraying them in a negative light? 

The dumb blonde character is often also portrayed as sexy. This is another stereotype that I find offensive. Do we still have to use a pretty woman or sex to get people to watch a show? I think that television shows and movies should be more about the story line than what the characters look like. Times have changed and I think it is time to move past many stereotypes.

In my opinion, the stereotypical dumb blonde character makes me cringe. I think this character has been over used and is demoralizing to women. I have seen this character in many movies and television shows. I think it cheapens the show and is not at all realistic. If I see the ""dumb blonde"" in a show, it makes me less likely to want to watch it. 

I find this stereotype is not at all realistic and is really just another way to put women down. I think it is important to have strong female characters in movies and television shows. The stereotype of dumb blondes and women staying home to take care of a family and home is one that should be done away with. Times have changed. Women can be strong, independent and intelligent. This is what television shows should be portraying now. How are we going to teach children that women can do whatever they set their mind to if television shows are constantly portraying them in a negative light? 

The dumb blonde character is often also portrayed as sexy. This is another stereotype that I find offensive. Do we still have to use a pretty woman or sex to get people to watch a show? I think that television shows and movies should be more about the story line than what the characters look like. Times have changed and I think it is time to move past many stereotypes.

In my opinion, the stereotypical dumb blonde character makes me cringe. I think this character has been over used and is demoralizing to women. I have seen this character in many movies and television shows. I think it cheapens the show and is not at all realistic. If I see the ""dumb blonde"" in a show, it makes me less likely to want to watch it. 

I find this stereotype is not at all realistic and is really just another way to put women down. I think it is important to have strong female characters in movies and television shows. The stereotype of dumb blondes and women staying home to take care of a family and home is one that should be done away with. Times have changed. Women can be strong, independent and intelligent. This is what television shows should be portraying now. How are we going to teach children that women can do whatever they set their mind to if television shows are constantly portraying them in a negative light? 

The dumb blonde character is often also portrayed as sexy. This is another stereotype that I find offensive. Do we still have to use a pretty woman or sex to get people to watch a show? I think that television shows and movies should be more about the story line than what the characters look like. Times have changed and I think it is time to move past many stereotypes.

In my opinion, the stereotypical dumb blonde character makes me cringe. I think this character has been over used and is demoralizing to women. I have seen this character in many movies and television shows. I think it cheapens the show and is not at all realistic. If I see the ""dumb blonde"" in a show, it makes me less likely to want to watch it. 

I find this stereotype is not at all realistic and is really just another way to put women down. I think it is important to have strong female characters in movies and television shows. The stereotype of dumb blondes and women staying home to take care of a family and home is one that should be done away with. Times have changed. Women can be strong, independent and intelligent. This is what television shows should be portraying now. How are we going to teach children that women can do whatever they set their mind to if television shows are constantly portraying them in a negative light? 

The dumb blonde character is often also portrayed as sexy. This is another stereotype that I find offensive. Do we still have to use a pretty woman or sex to get people to watch a show? I think that television shows and movies should be more about the story line than what the characters look like. Times have changed and I think it is time to move past many stereotypes. We are supposed to be accepting of everyone and these stereotypes are just putting people down.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the stereotypical dumb blonde character makes me cringe. I think this character has been over used and is demoralizing to women. I have seen this character in many movies and television shows. I think it cheapens the show and is not at all realistic. If I see the ""dumb blonde"" in a show, it makes me less likely to want to watch it. 

I find this stereotype is not at all realistic and is really just another way to put women down. I think it is important to have strong female characters in movies and television shows. The stereotype of dumb blondes and women staying home to take care of a family and home is one that should be done away with. Times have changed. Women can be strong, independent and intelligent. This is what television shows should be portraying now. How are we going to teach children that women can do whatever they set their mind to if television shows are constantly portraying them in a negative light? 

The dumb blonde character is often also portrayed as sexy. This is another stereotype that I find offensive. Do we still have to use a pretty woman or sex to get people to watch a show? I think that television shows and movies should be more about the story line than what the characters look like. Times have changed and I think it is time to move past many stereotypes.

I have seen this character in many movies and television shows. I think it cheapens the show and is not at all realistic. If I see the ""dumb blonde"" in a show, it makes me less likely to want to watch it. 

I find this stereotype is not at all realistic and is really just another way to put women down. I think it is important to have strong female characters in movies and television shows. The stereotype of dumb blondes and women staying home to take care of a family and home is one that should be done away with. Times have changed. Women can be strong, independent and intelligent. This is what television shows should be portraying now. How are we going to teach children that women can do whatever they set their mind to if television shows are constantly portraying them in a negative light? 

The dumb blonde character is often also portrayed as sexy. This is another stereotype that I find offensive. Do we still have to use a pretty woman or sex to get people to watch a show? I think that television shows and movies should be more about the story line than what the characters look like. Times have changed and I think it is time to move past many stereotypes. We are supposed to be accepting of everyone and these stereotypes are just putting people down.

I have seen this character in many movies and television shows. I think it cheapens the show and is not at all realistic. If I see the ""dumb blonde"" in a show, it makes me less likely to want to watch it. 

I find this stereotype is not at all realistic and is really just another way to put women down. I think it is important to have strong female characters in movies and television shows. The stereotype of dumb blondes and women staying home to take care of a family and home is one that should be done away with. Times have changed. Women can be strong, independent and intelligent. This is what television shows should be portraying now. How are we going to teach children that women can do whatever they set their mind to if television shows are constantly portraying them in a negative light? 

The dumb blonde character is often also portrayed as sexy. This is another stereotype that I find offensive. Do we still have to use a pretty woman or sex to get people to watch a show? I think that television shows and movies should be more about the story line than what the characters look like. Times have changed and I think it is time to move past many stereotypes. We are supposed to be accepting of everyone and these stereotypes are just putting people down.

If I see the ""dumb blonde"" in a show, it makes me less likely to want to watch it. 

I find this stereotype is not at all realistic and is really just another way to put women down. I think it is important to have strong female characters in movies and television shows. The stereotype of dumb blondes and women staying home to take care of a family and home is one that should be done away with. Times have changed. Women can be strong, independent and intelligent. This is what television shows should be portraying now. How are we going to teach children that women can do whatever they set their mind to if television shows are constantly portraying them in a negative light? 

The dumb blonde character is often also portrayed as sexy. This is another stereotype that I find offensive. Do we still have to use a pretty woman or sex to get people to watch a show? I think that television shows and movies should be more about the story line than what the characters look like. Times have changed and I think it is time to move past many stereotypes. We are supposed to be accepting of everyone and these stereotypes are just putting people down. There are many stereoptypes that we should be getting rid of but I would be happy if they started with eliminating the dumb blonde. It is time for change and I think this would be a great place to star",user,22,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
