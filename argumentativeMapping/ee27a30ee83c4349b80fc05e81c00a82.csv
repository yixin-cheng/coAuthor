I think that all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world.
  Not keeping up with news would lead to poor decisions that can affect people around us negatively in that we might not be able to make the right decisions when it comes to our lives.

Engaging with current events will also give us the information we will need for most of the things we do. For example, we can track the traffic by monitoring the news; for people doing trading it is essential that they track current events specially on the trades they are planning to make for the day or the future. Also for people in the technology field, being aware of what is happening and being informed on the general state of the art would save them time in coming up with inventions that have already been solved.

I think that all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world.
  Not keeping up with news would lead to poor decisions that can affect people around us negatively in that we might not be able to make the right decisions when it comes to our lives.

Also for people in the technology field, being aware of what is happening and being informed on the general state of the art would save them time in coming up with inventions that have already been solved.
