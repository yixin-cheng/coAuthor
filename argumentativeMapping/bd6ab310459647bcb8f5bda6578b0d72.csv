In my opinion, screen time is an important benchmark in how we are spending our time. Whether or not there is inherent risk in what we do on our screens aside, spending too much time staring at a screen is physically unhealthy. t's not just the eyes that suffer, it's the body.
 Physical exercise is important for people to maintain energy. When we sit, lay or even stand in one position for too long, our bodies suffer the consequences. 
I'm not saying that we should all go out and run a marathon.
 What I'm saying is that we need to be mindful of how much time we spend in a stationary position. The pandemic has accelerated our submersion into a more digital world. That is unfortunate, but it didn't cause this particular problem but rather just shined a light on an already growing issue that people were facing, especially children and young people.  
The good news is that we can all take steps to mitigate the negative effects of screen time.
 Apps are available for all major platforms which can help us monitor our screen time. I use Moment on my iPhone and it's a great way to keep track of how much time I spend on my phone. With the information I'm provided, by the app, I am better able to manage my daily activities. For instance, I can restrict my phone usage to a certain number of minutes, or hours, before taking a break to exercise, rest or do something else. I find that when I'm keeping track of my time in a more detailed way, I am shocked by the amount of time I devote to staring at a screen.  also use a desktop app called Self Control to block certain websites for a set amount of time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, screen time is an important benchmark in how we are spending our time. Whether or not there is inherent risk in what we do on our screens aside, spending too much time staring at a screen is physically unhealthy. t's not just the eyes that suffer, it's the body.
 Physical exercise is important for people to maintain energy. When we sit, lay or even stand in one position for too long, our bodies suffer the consequences. 
I'm not saying that we should all go out and run a marathon.
 What I'm saying is that we need to be mindful of how much time we spend in a stationary position. The pandemic has accelerated our submersion into a more digital world. That is unfortunate, but it didn't cause this particular problem but rather just shined a light on an already growing issue that people were facing, especially children and young people.  
The good news is that we can all take steps to mitigate the negative effects of screen time.
 Apps are available for all major platforms which can help us monitor our screen time. I use Moment on my iPhone and it's a great way to keep track of how much time I spend on my phone. With the information I'm provided, by the app, I am better able to manage my daily activities.

 Physical exercise is important for people to maintain energy. When we sit, lay or even stand in one position for too long, our bodies suffer the consequences.

The good news is that we can all take steps to mitigate the negative effects of screen time.
 Apps are available for all major platforms which can help us monitor our screen time. I use Moment on my iPhone and it's a great way to keep track of how much time I spend on my phone. With the information I'm provided, by the app, I am better able to manage my daily activities. For instance, I can restrict my phone usage to a certain number of minutes, or hours, before taking a break to exercise, rest or do something else. I find that when I'm keeping track of my time in a more detailed way, I am shocked by the amount of time I devote to staring at a screen.  also use a desktop app called Self Control to block certain websites for a set amount of time.

 Physical exercise is important for people to maintain energy. When we sit, lay or even stand in one position for too long, our bodies suffer the consequences.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, screen time is an important benchmark in how we are spending our time. Whether or not there is inherent risk in what we do on our screens aside, spending too much time staring at a screen is physically unhealthy. t's not just the eyes that suffer, it's the body.
 Physical exercise is important for people to maintain energy. When we sit, lay or even stand in one position for too long, our bodies suffer the consequences. 
I'm not saying that we should all go out and run a marathon.
 What I'm saying is that we need to be mindful of how much time we spend in a stationary position. The pandemic has accelerated our submersion into a more digital world. That is unfortunate, but it didn't cause this particular problem but rather just shined a light on an already growing issue that people were facing, especially children and young people.  
The good news is that we can all take steps to mitigate the negative effects of screen time.
 Apps are available for all major platforms which can help us monitor our screen time. I use Moment on my iPhone and it's a great way to keep track of how much time I spend on my phone. With the information I'm provided, by the app, I am better able to manage my daily activities.

With the information I'm provided, by the app, I am better able to manage my daily activities. For instance, I can restrict my phone usage to a certain number of minutes, or hours, before taking a break to exercise, rest or do something else. I find that when I'm keeping track of my time in a more detailed way, I am shocked by the amount of time I devote to staring at a screen.  also use a desktop app called Self Control to block certain websites for a set amount of time.

In my opinion, screen time is an important benchmark in how we are spending our time. Whether or not there is inherent risk in what we do on our screens aside, spending too much time staring at a screen is physically unhealthy. t's not just the eyes that suffer, it's the body.
 Physical exercise is important for people to maintain energy. When we sit, lay or even stand in one position for too long, our bodies suffer the consequences. 
I'm not saying that we should all go out and run a marathon.
 What I'm saying is that we need to be mindful of how much time we spend in a stationary position. The pandemic has accelerated our submersion into a more digital world.

The good news is that we can all take steps to mitigate the negative effects of screen time.
 Apps are available for all major platforms which can help us monitor our screen time. I use Moment on my iPhone and it's a great way to keep track of how much time I spend on my phone. With the information I'm provided, by the app, I am better able to manage my daily activities.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, screen time is an important benchmark in how we are spending our time. Whether or not there is inherent risk in what we do on our screens aside, spending too much time staring at a screen is physically unhealthy. t's not just the eyes that suffer, it's the body.
 Physical exercise is important for people to maintain energy. When we sit, lay or even stand in one position for too long, our bodies suffer the consequences. 
I'm not saying that we should all go out and run a marathon.
 What I'm saying is that we need to be mindful of how much time we spend in a stationary position. The pandemic has accelerated our submersion into a more digital world. That is unfortunate, but it didn't cause this particular problem but rather just shined a light on an already growing issue that people were facing, especially children and young people.  
The good news is that we can all take steps to mitigate the negative effects of screen time.
 Apps are available for all major platforms which can help us monitor our screen time. I use Moment on my iPhone and it's a great way to keep track of how much time I spend on my phone. With the information I'm provided, by the app, I am better able to manage my daily activities. For instance, I can restrict my phone usage to a certain number of minutes, or hours, before taking a break to exercise, rest or do something else.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, screen time is an important benchmark in how we are spending our time. Whether or not there is inherent risk in what we do on our screens aside, spending too much time staring at a screen is physically unhealthy. t's not just the eyes that suffer, it's the body.
 Physical exercise is important for people to maintain energy. When we sit, lay or even stand in one position for too long, our bodies suffer the consequences. 
I'm not saying that we should all go out and run a marathon.
 What I'm saying is that we need to be mindful of how much time we spend in a stationary position. The pandemic has accelerated our submersion into a more digital world. That is unfortunate, but it didn't cause this particular problem but rather just shined a light on an already growing issue that people were facing, especially children and young people.  
The good news is that we can all take steps to mitigate the negative effects of screen time.
 Apps are available for all major platforms which can help us monitor our screen time. I use Moment on my iPhone and it's a great way to keep track of how much time I spend on my phone. With the information I'm provided, by the app, I am better able to manage my daily activities. For instance, I can restrict my phone usage to a certain number of minutes, or hours, before taking a break to exercise, rest or do something else.

In my opinion, screen time is an important benchmark in how we are spending our time. Whether or not there is inherent risk in what we do on our screens aside, spending too much time staring at a screen is physically unhealthy. t's not just the eyes that suffer, it's the body.
 Physical exercise is important for people to maintain energy. When we sit, lay or even stand in one position for too long, our bodies suffer the consequences. 
I'm not saying that we should all go out and run a marathon.

The good news is that we can all take steps to mitigate the negative effects of screen time.
 Apps are available for all major platforms which can help us monitor our screen time. I use Moment on my iPhone and it's a great way to keep track of how much time I spend on my phone. With the information I'm provided, by the app, I am better able to manage my daily activities.

In my opinion, screen time is an important benchmark in how we are spending our time. Whether or not there is inherent risk in what we do on our screens aside, spending too much time staring at a screen is physically unhealthy. t's not just the eyes that suffer, it's the body.
 Physical exercise is important for people to maintain energy. When we sit, lay or even stand in one position for too long, our bodies suffer the consequences. 
I'm not saying that we should all go out and run a marathon.
 What I'm saying is that we need to be mindful of how much time we spend in a stationary position. The pandemic has accelerated our submersion into a more digital world. That is unfortunate, but it didn't cause this particular problem but rather just shined a light on an already growing issue that people were facing, especially children and young people.  
The good news is that we can all take steps to mitigate the negative effects of screen time.
 Apps are available for all major platforms which can help us monitor our screen time. I use Moment on my iPhone and it's a great way to keep track of how much time I spend on my phone. With the information I'm provided, by the app, I am better able to manage my daily activities. For instance, I can restrict my phone usage to a certain number of minutes, or hours, before taking a break to exercise, rest or do something else. I find that when I'm keeping track of my time in a more detailed way, I am shocked by the amount of time I devote to staring at a screen.  also use a desktop app called Self Control to block certain websites for a set amount of time.


The pandemic is very difficult for everyone but if we can find any bright spots in the tragedy of this time period, I think we will find them in retrospect. We are living through a difficult time, but it will help us to learn how to live better.
