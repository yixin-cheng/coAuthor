In my opinion, extreme sports are too dangerous to be called sports, and cross the line. 

 believe that the line between what is reasonable and what is not should be drawn at the point where the risk of death or serious injury becomes
 too great. With mountain climbing, an estimated 7000 people die every year, and many more are seriously injured.  Compare this with Football,  where less than 30 on average die each year. .  With some extreme sports such as base jumping, the fatalities are even higher: some reports say that 1 in 60 dies. 
The reason that I believe that extreme sports are too dangerous to be called sports is because they are not safe.

With some extreme sports such as base jumping, the fatalities are even higher: some reports say that 1 in 60 dies.

In my opinion, extreme sports are too dangerous to be called sports, and cross the line. 

 believe that the line between what is reasonable and what is not should be drawn at the point where the risk of death or serious injury becomes
 too great. With mountain climbing, an estimated 7000 people die every year, and many more are seriously injured.  Compare this with Football,  where less than 30 on average die each year. .  With some extreme sports such as base jumping, the fatalities are even higher: some reports say that 1 in 60 dies. 
The reason that I believe that extreme sports are too dangerous to be called sports is because they are not safe.
 xtreme sports are not safe because they are not regulated., and encourage too high of a risk. 

Extreme sports affect future generations. Our children see extreme sports, and think this behavior is fine. They see the glory and fame that extreme sports bring, and think that this risky behavior is what they should be doing.

 Extreme sports are the cause of many expensive injuries. People place an unneeded burden on the healthcare system, for their own selfish reasons.  How many people have been delayed needed surgeries because the latest daredevil was jumping over 30 motorcycles, or broke a rib trying the newest stunt?

How many people have been delayed needed surgeries because the latest daredevil was jumping over 30 motorcycles, or broke a rib trying the newest stunt? 

Extreme sports also affect the environment. They bring people to pristine areas, lugging heavy plastic waste that is often discarded.  The trash pile on Mount Everest is a good example of this.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, extreme sports are too dangerous to be called sports, and cross the line. 

 believe that the line between what is reasonable and what is not should be drawn at the point where the risk of death or serious injury becomes
 too great. With mountain climbing, an estimated 7000 people die every year, and many more are seriously injured.  Compare this with Football,  where less than 30 on average die each year. .  With some extreme sports such as base jumping, the fatalities are even higher: some reports say that 1 in 60 dies. 
The reason that I believe that extreme sports are too dangerous to be called sports is because they are not safe. for even trained athletes.  xtreme sports are nofteont regulated., and encourage too high of a risk. 

Extreme sports affect future generations. Our children see extreme sports, and think this behavior is fine. They see the glory and fame that extreme sports bring, and think that this risky behavior is what they should be doing. 
Extreme sports affect the economy.
 Extreme sports are the cause of many expensive injuries. People place an unneeded burden on the healthcare system, for their own selfish reasons.
