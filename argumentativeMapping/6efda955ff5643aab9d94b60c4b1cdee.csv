Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

Firstly, app-driven dating is massively ubiquitous. You can't escape it.

People say it encourages lying and misrepresentation. I don't think that's true. Did people start lying to potential romantic partners when they started using dating apps? Or was it always there? Clearly the latter.
I think it's just a new medium for the same old human behavior.
 Imagine a nice guy who's lonely. He goes on a dating app and what does he see? A bunch of pictures of women who are 5'10"" and look like models. Or a bunch of men who look like Olympic swimmers.
And then he sees his own picture.
 Does it compare? Heck, no! So he lies about his height, his weight, his income, his job, whatever. Is this wrong? Only if the pool of dating partners are all scrupulously honest, which they are not.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

Firstly, app-driven dating is massively ubiquitous. You can't escape it.

People say it encourages lying and misrepresentation. I don't think that's true. Did people start lying to potential romantic partners when they started using dating apps? Or was it always there? Clearly the latter.
I think it's just a new medium for the same old human behavior.
 Imagine a nice guy who's lonely. He goes on a dating app and what does he see? A bunch of pictures of women who are 5'10"" and look like models. Or a bunch of men who look like Olympic swimmers.
And then he sees his own picture.
 Does it compare? Heck, no! So he lies about his height, his weight, his income, his job, whatever. Is this wrong? Only if the pool of dating partners are all scrupulously honest, which they are not.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

Firstly, app-driven dating is massively ubiquitous. You can't escape it.

People say it encourages lying and misrepresentation. I don't think that's true. Did people start lying to potential romantic partners when they started using dating apps? Or was it always there? Clearly the latter.
I think it's just a new medium for the same old human behavior.
 Imagine a nice guy who's lonely. He goes on a dating app and what does he see? A bunch of pictures of women who are 5'10"" and look like models. Or a bunch of men who look like Olympic swimmers.
And then he sees his own picture.
 Does it compare? Heck, no! So he lies about his height, his weight, his income, his job, whatever. Is this wrong? Only if the pool of dating partners are all scrupulously honest, which they are not.

So our friend, like most people, begin to apply corrections to what they see in the app. %'10"" is 5""6"". 120 pounds is 150. A full head of hair becomes thinner and more sparse. People who love the outdoors and go to the gym become couch potatoes who like to watch the Nature Channel.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

Firstly, app-driven dating is massively ubiquitous. You can't escape it.

People say it encourages lying and misrepresentation. I don't think that's true. Did people start lying to potential romantic partners when they started using dating apps? Or was it always there? Clearly the latter.
I think it's just a new medium for the same old human behavior.
 Imagine a nice guy who's lonely. He goes on a dating app and what does he see? A bunch of pictures of women who are 5'10"" and look like models. Or a bunch of men who look like Olympic swimmers.
And then he sees his own picture.
 Does it compare? Heck, no! So he lies about his height, his weight, his income, his job, whatever. Is this wrong? Only if the pool of dating partners are all scrupulously honest, which they are not.

So our friend, like most people, begin to apply corrections to what they see in the app. %'10"" is 5""6"". 120 pounds is 150. A full head of hair becomes thinner and more sparse. People who love the outdoors and go to the gym become couch potatoes who like to watch the Nature Channel.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

Firstly, app-driven dating is massively ubiquitous. You can't escape it.

People say it encourages lying and misrepresentation. I don't think that's true. Did people start lying to potential romantic partners when they started using dating apps? Or was it always there? Clearly the latter.
I think it's just a new medium for the same old human behavior.
 Imagine a nice guy who's lonely. He goes on a dating app and what does he see? A bunch of pictures of women who are 5'10"" and look like models. Or a bunch of men who look like Olympic swimmers.
And then he sees his own picture.
 Does it compare? Heck, no! So he lies about his height, his weight, his income, his job, whatever. Is this wrong? Only if the pool of dating partners are all scrupulously honest, which they are not.

So our friend, like most people, begin to apply corrections to what they see in the app. %'10"" is 5""6"". 120 pounds is 150. A full head of hair becomes thinner and more sparse. People who love the outdoors and go to the gym become couch potatoes who like to watch the Nature Channel.

And so on. So the question we must ask ourselves is, how bad is this?

And so on. So the question we must ask ourselves is, how bad is this?
I think it's not bad at all.
 Because when two people meet, there is either a spark or not. If a spark is there, they all is almost immediately forgive, especially if the misrepresentation is mutual.
If there is no spark, then the misrepresentation is irrelevant.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

Firstly, app-driven dating is massively ubiquitous. You can't escape it.

People say it encourages lying and misrepresentation. I don't think that's true. Did people start lying to potential romantic partners when they started using dating apps? Or was it always there? Clearly the latter.
I think it's just a new medium for the same old human behavior.
 Imagine a nice guy who's lonely. He goes on a dating app and what does he see? A bunch of pictures of women who are 5'10"" and look like models. Or a bunch of men who look like Olympic swimmers.
And then he sees his own picture.
 Does it compare? Heck, no! So he lies about his height, his weight, his income, his job, whatever. Is this wrong? Only if the pool of dating partners are all scrupulously honest, which they are not.

So our friend, like most people, begin to apply corrections to what they see in the app. %'10"" is 5""6"". 120 pounds is 150. A full head of hair becomes thinner and more sparse. People who love the outdoors and go to the gym become couch potatoes who like to watch the Nature Channel.

And so on. So the question we must ask ourselves is, how bad is this?

If there is no spark, then the misrepresentation is irrelevant.

So what's the problem?
