In my opinion, reading is always better than listening. Reading involves a ritual that you do not get with an audiobook. You sit down with a cup of coffee in a chair. You open the book and hold it in your hands. You flip pages and go at your own speed. You are fully immersed in the author's words. Nothing else is going on in the world. It's an experience that is very unique.

In my opinion, reading is always better than listening. Reading involves a ritual that you do not get with an audiobook. You sit down with a cup of coffee in a chair. You open the book and hold it in your hands. You flip pages and go at your own speed. You are fully immersed in the author's words. Nothing else is going on in the world. It's an experience that is very unique. 
With an audiobook you get none of that.
 You hear the same story but you don't get the same experience. With an audiobook, you get distracted. You often times are doing other things at the same time. You might end up missing part of the story because of that. 
Reading takes time but it's so worth the time you spend to just sit there and enjoy reading.

You open the book and hold it in your hands. You flip pages and go at your own speed. You are fully immersed in the author's words. Nothing else is going on in the world. It's an experience that is very unique. 
With an audiobook you get none of that.
 You hear the same story but you don't get the same experience. With an audiobook, you get distracted. You often times are doing other things at the same time. You might end up missing part of the story because of that. 
Reading takes time but it's so worth the time you spend to just sit there and enjoy reading.
 You won't be able to multitask but that is part of the charm. It's an old fashioned luxury you could say. I think it's important to enjoy the experience of reading. The experience of doing it, not just the actual task of hearing it like in an audio book.

In my opinion, reading is always better than listening. Reading involves a ritual that you do not get with an audiobook. You sit down with a cup of coffee in a chair. You open the book and hold it in your hands. You flip pages and go at your own speed. You are fully immersed in the author's words. Nothing else is going on in the world. It's an experience that is very unique. 
With an audiobook you get none of that.
 You hear the same story but you don't get the same experience. With an audiobook, you get distracted. You often times are doing other things at the same time. You might end up missing part of the story because of that.

In my opinion, reading is always better than listening. Reading involves a ritual that you do not get with an audiobook. You sit down with a cup of coffee in a chair. You open the book and hold it in your hands. You flip pages and go at your own speed. You are fully immersed in the author's words. Nothing else is going on in the world. It's an experience that is very unique. 
With an audiobook you get none of that.
 You hear the same story but you don't get the same experience. With an audiobook, you get distracted. You often times are doing other things at the same time. You might end up missing part of the story because of that. 
Reading takes time but it's so worth the time you spend to just sit there and enjoy reading.

You open the book and hold it in your hands. You flip pages and go at your own speed. You are fully immersed in the author's words. Nothing else is going on in the world.

With an audiobook you get none of that.
 You hear the same story but you don't get the same experience. With an audiobook, you get distracted. You often times are doing other things at the same time. You might end up missing part of the story because of that. 
Reading takes time but it's so worth the time you spend to just sit there and enjoy reading.
 You won't be able to multitask but that is part of the charm. It's an old fashioned luxury you could say. I think it's important to enjoy the experience of reading. The experience of doing it, not just the actual task of hearing it like in an audio book.

In my opinion, reading is always better than listening. Reading involves a ritual that you do not get with an audiobook. You sit down with a cup of coffee in a chair. You open the book and hold it in your hands. You flip pages and go at your own speed. You are fully immersed in the author's words. Nothing else is going on in the world. It's an experience that is very unique. 
With an audiobook you get none of that.
 You hear the same story but you don't get the same experience. With an audiobook, you get distracted. You often times are doing other things at the same time. You might end up missing part of the story because of that.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, reading is always better than listening. Reading involves a ritual that you do not get with an audiobook. You sit down with a cup of coffee in a chair. You open the book and hold it in your hands. You flip pages and go at your own speed. You are fully immersed in the author's words. Nothing else is going on in the world. It's an experience that is very unique. 
With an audiobook you get none of that.
 You hear the same story but you don't get the same experience. With an audiobook, you get distracted. You often times are doing other things at the same time. You might end up missing part of the story because of that. 
Reading takes time but it's so worth the time you spend to just sit there and enjoy reading.
 You won't be able to multitask but that is part of the charm. It's an old fashioned luxury you could say. I think it's important to enjoy the experience of reading. The experience of doing it, not just the actual task of hearing it like in an audio book.

While audiobooks do have their advantages, it's nice to disconnect from technology. It even comes down to physically going to the library to get a book. Rather than downloading an audiobook, it's so refreshing to visit a library. That's another experience that you miss out on otherwise. Obviously, audiobooks aren't going anywhere anytime soon but it's nice to detach from that world for awhile.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, reading is always better than listening. Reading involves a ritual that you do not get with an audiobook. You sit down with a cup of coffee in a chair. You open the book and hold it in your hands. You flip pages and go at your own speed. You are fully immersed in the author's words. Nothing else is going on in the world. It's an experience that is very unique. 
With an audiobook you get none of that.
 You hear the same story but you don't get the same experience. With an audiobook, you get distracted. You often times are doing other things at the same time. You might end up missing part of the story because of that. 
Reading takes time but it's so worth the time you spend to just sit there and enjoy reading.
 You won't be able to multitask but that is part of the charm. It's an old fashioned luxury you could say. I think it's important to enjoy the experience of reading. The experience of doing it, not just the actual task of hearing it like in an audio book.

In my opinion, reading is always better than listening. Reading involves a ritual that you do not get with an audiobook. You sit down with a cup of coffee in a chair. You open the book and hold it in your hands. You flip pages and go at your own speed. You are fully immersed in the author's words. Nothing else is going on in the world. It's an experience that is very unique. 
With an audiobook you get none of that.
 You hear the same story but you don't get the same experience. With an audiobook, you get distracted. You often times are doing other things at the same time. You might end up missing part of the story because of that. 
Reading takes time but it's so worth the time you spend to just sit there and enjoy reading.
 You won't be able to multitask but that is part of the charm. It's an old fashioned luxury you could say. I think it's important to enjoy the experience of reading. The experience of doing it, not just the actual task of hearing it like in an audio book.

While audiobooks do have their advantages, it's nice to disconnect from technology. It even comes down to physically going to the library to get a book. Rather than downloading an audiobook, it's so refreshing to visit a library. That's another experience that you miss out on otherwise. Obviously, audiobooks aren't going anywhere anytime soon but it's nice to detach from that world for awhile.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, reading is always better than listening. Reading involves a ritual that you do not get with an audiobook. You sit down with a cup of coffee in a chair. You open the book and hold it in your hands. You flip pages and go at your own speed. You are fully immersed in the author's words. Nothing else is going on in the world. It's an experience that is very unique. 
With an audiobook you get none of that.
 You hear the same story but you don't get the same experience. With an audiobook, you get distracted. You often times are doing other things at the same time. You might end up missing part of the story because of that. 
Reading takes time but it's so worth the time you spend to just sit there and enjoy reading.
 You won't be able to multitask but that is part of the charm. It's an old fashioned luxury you could say. I think it's important to enjoy the experience of reading. The experience of doing it, not just the actual task of hearing it like in an audio book.

While audiobooks do have their advantages, it's nice to disconnect from technology. It even comes down to physically going to the library to get a book.

In my opinion, reading is always better than listening. Reading involves a ritual that you do not get with an audiobook. You sit down with a cup of coffee in a chair. You open the book and hold it in your hands. You flip pages and go at your own speed. You are fully immersed in the author's words. Nothing else is going on in the world. It's an experience that is very unique. 
With an audiobook you get none of that.
 You hear the same story but you don't get the same experience. With an audiobook, you get distracted. You often times are doing other things at the same time. You might end up missing part of the story because of that. 
Reading takes time but it's so worth the time you spend to just sit there and enjoy reading.
 You won't be able to multitask but that is part of the charm. It's an old fashioned luxury you could say. I think it's important to enjoy the experience of reading. The experience of doing it, not just the actual task of hearing it like in an audio book.

While audiobooks do have their advantages, it's nice to disconnect from technology. It even comes down to physically going to the library to get a book. Rather than downloading an audiobook, it's so refreshing to visit a library. That's another experience that you miss out on otherwise. Obviously, audiobooks aren't going anywhere anytime soon but it's nice to detach from that world for awhile.

In my opinion, reading is always better than listening. Reading involves a ritual that you do not get with an audiobook. You sit down with a cup of coffee in a chair. You open the book and hold it in your hands. You flip pages and go at your own speed. You are fully immersed in the author's words. Nothing else is going on in the world. It's an experience that is very unique. 
With an audiobook you get none of that.
 You hear the same story but you don't get the same experience. With an audiobook, you get distracted. You often times are doing other things at the same time. You might end up missing part of the story because of that. 
Reading takes time but it's so worth the time you spend to just sit there and enjoy reading.
 You won't be able to multitask but that is part of the charm. It's an old fashioned luxury you could say. I think it's important to enjoy the experience of reading. The experience of doing it, not just the actual task of hearing it like in an audio book.

While audiobooks do have their advantages, it's nice to disconnect from technology. It even comes down to physically going to the library to get a book. Rather than downloading an audiobook, it's so refreshing to visit a library. That's another experience that you miss out on otherwise. Obviously, audiobooks aren't going anywhere anytime soon but it's nice to detach from that world for awhile.

I firmly believe a physical book is better. It feels nicer and I have better interactions with an actual book. I'm all for the occasional audiobook sometimes.

In my opinion, reading is always better than listening. Reading involves a ritual that you do not get with an audiobook. You sit down with a cup of coffee in a chair. You open the book and hold it in your hands. You flip pages and go at your own speed. You are fully immersed in the author's words. Nothing else is going on in the world. It's an experience that is very unique. 
With an audiobook you get none of that.
 You hear the same story but you don't get the same experience. With an audiobook, you get distracted. You often times are doing other things at the same time. You might end up missing part of the story because of that. 
Reading takes time but it's so worth the time you spend to just sit there and enjoy reading.
