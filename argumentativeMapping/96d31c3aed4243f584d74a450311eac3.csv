In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.

Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.

Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.

There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.

By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.

By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process.

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.

I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.  

MIf I student gets injured and is bleeding, schools don't waste a second thought sending that student to the nurse and giving the student a Band-Aid.  Schools can perform well in addressing the health problems of students in many different areas.  I believe helping students undergoing their period is another area where the schools can provide help.  Ultim  ",user,20,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.

There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.  

MIf I student gets injured and is bleeding, schools don't waste a second thought sending that student to the nurse and giving the student a Band-Aid.  Schools can perform well in addressing the health problems of students in many different areas.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.  

MIf I student gets injured and is bleeding, schools don't waste a second thought sending that student to the nurse and giving the student a Band-Aid.  Schools can perform well in addressing the health problems of students in many different areas.  I believe helping students undergoing their period is another area where the schools can provide help.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.  

MIf I student gets injured and is bleeding, schools don't waste a second thought sending that student to the nurse and giving the student a Band-Aid.  Schools can perform well in addressing the health problems of students in many different areas.  I believe helping students undergoing their period is another area where the schools can provide help.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.

I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process.

Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.  

MIf I student gets injured and is bleeding, schools don't waste a second thought sending that student to the nurse and giving the student a Band-Aid.  Schools can perform well in addressing the health problems of students in many different areas.  I believe helping students undergoing their period is another area where the schools can provide help.  If a student is unable to focus on their school work because they are in the middle of getting their period, then it is time for the schools to step up.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.  

MIf I student gets injured and is bleeding, schools don't waste a second thought sending that student to the nurse and giving the student a Band-Aid.  Schools can perform well in addressing the health problems of students in many different areas.  I believe helping students undergoing their period is another area where the schools can provide help.  If a student is unable to focus on their school work because they are in the middle of getting their period, then it is time for the schools to step up.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.
