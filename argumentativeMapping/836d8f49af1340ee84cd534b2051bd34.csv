In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really damp",user,15,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way.

This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. 

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. T",user,20,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. 

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all thig",user,20,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation.

I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it.

She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm.

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education.

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things.

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. 

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way. Band aids are used for blood, and toilet paper is used for cleaning. The two together are sort of what a tampon or pad serves for.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around.

Band aids are used for blood, and toilet paper is used for cleaning. The two together are sort of what a tampon or pad serves for.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority.

I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period.

This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. 

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. 

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way. Band aids are used for blood, and toilet paper is used for cleaning. The two together are sort of what a tampon or pad serves for.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm.

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. 

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way. Band aids are used for blood, and toilet paper is used for cleaning. The two together are sort of what a tampon or pad serves for. I find tampons to also be just as necessary as the rest of the items. We all have to deal with blood at some point, so why not just deal with it conveniently?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority.

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. 

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way. Band aids are used for blood, and toilet paper is used for cleaning. The two together are sort of what a tampon or pad serves for. I find tampons to also be just as necessary as the rest of the items. We all have to deal with blood at some point, so why not just deal with it conveniently? This convienance would mean more to the girls than i think they would even be able to communicate. Maybe not at ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it.

She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. 

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way. Band aids are used for blood, and toilet paper is used for cleaning. The two together are sort of what a tampon or pad serves for. I find tampons to also be just as necessary as the rest of the items. We all have to deal with blood at some point, so why not just deal with it conveniently? This convienance would mean more to the girls than i think they would even be able to communicate. Maybe not at first, but when it comes a point in ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. 

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way. Band aids are used for blood, and toilet paper is used for cleaning. The two together are sort of what a tampon or pad serves for. I find tampons to also be just as necessary as the rest of the items. We all have to deal with blood at some point, so why not just deal with it conveniently? This convienance would mean more to the girls than i think they would even be able to communicate. Maybe not at first, but when it comes a point in time when they need it.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it.

This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. 

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way. Band aids are used for blood, and toilet paper is used for cleaning. The two together are sort of what a tampon or pad serves for. I find tampons to also be just as necessary as the rest of the items. We all have to deal with blood at some point, so why not just deal with it conveniently?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. 

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way.

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. 

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way. Band aids are used for blood, and toilet paper is used for cleaning. The two together are sort of what a tampon or pad serves for. I find tampons to also be just as necessary as the rest of the items. We all have to deal with blood at some point, so why not just deal with it conveniently?

This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. 

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way. Band aids are used for blood, and toilet paper is used for cleaning. The two together are sort of what a tampon or pad serves for. I find tampons to also be just as necessary as the rest of the items. We all have to deal with blood at some point, so why not just deal with it conveniently? This convienance would mean more to the girls than i think they would even be able to communicate. Maybe not at first, but when it comes a point in time when they need it. Its like when you are trapped on the toilet with no toilet paper. Its like your stranded in a dessert with no water or somethi",user,29,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way. Band aids are used for blood, and toilet paper is used for cleaning. The two together are sort of what a tampon or pad serves for. I find tampons to also be just as necessary as the rest of the items. We all have to deal with blood at some point, so why not just deal with it conveniently? This convienance would mean more to the girls than i think they would even be able to communicate. Maybe not at first, but when it comes a point in time when they need it.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. 

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way. Band aids are used for blood, and toilet paper is used for cleaning. The two together are sort of what a tampon or pad serves for. I find tampons to also be just as necessary as the rest of the items. We all have to deal with blood at some point, so why not just deal with it conveniently? This convienance would mean more to the girls than i think they would even be able to communicate. Maybe not at first, but when it comes a point in time when they need it.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. 

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way. Band aids are used for blood, and toilet paper is used for cleaning. The two together are sort of what a tampon or pad serves for. I find tampons to also be just as necessary as the rest of the items. We all have to deal with blood at some point, so why not just deal with it conveniently? This convienance would mean more to the girls than i think they would even be able to communicate. Maybe not at first, but when it comes a point in time when they need it.

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. 

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way. Band aids are used for blood, and toilet paper is used for cleaning. The two together are sort of what a tampon or pad serves for. I find tampons to also be just as necessary as the rest of the items. We all have to deal with blood at some point, so why not just deal with it conveniently? This convienance would mean more to the girls than i think they would even be able to communicate. Maybe not at first, but when it comes a point in time when they need it. Its like when you are trapped on the toilet with no toilet paper. Its like your stranded in a desert with no water or something.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. 

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way. Band aids are used for blood, and toilet paper is used for cleaning. The two together are sort of what a tampon or pad serves for.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. 

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way. Band aids are used for blood, and toilet paper is used for cleaning. The two together are sort of what a tampon or pad serves for. I find tampons to also be just as necessary as the rest of the items. We all have to deal with blood at some point, so why not just deal with it conveniently? This convienance would mean more to the girls than i think they would even be able to communicate. Maybe not at first, but when it comes a point in time when they need it.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. 

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way. Band aids are used for blood, and toilet paper is used for cleaning. The two together are sort of what a tampon or pad serves for. I find tampons to also be just as necessary as the rest of the items. We all have to deal with blood at some point, so why not just deal with it conveniently? This convienance would mean more to the girls than i think they would even be able to communicate. Maybe not at first, but when it comes a point in time when they need it. Its like when you are trapped on the toilet with no toilet paper. Its like your stranded in a desert with no water or something. Well i could see this being the case as well for unexpected period blood. In conclusion, this is w",user,31,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. 

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way. Band aids are used for blood, and toilet paper is used for cleaning. The two together are sort of what a tampon or pad serves for. I find tampons to also be just as necessary as the rest of the items. We all have to deal with blood at some point, so why not just deal with it conveniently? This convienance would mean more to the girls than i think they would even be able to communicate. Maybe not at first, but when it comes a point in time when they need it. Its like when you are trapped on the toilet with no toilet paper. Its like your stranded in a desert with no water or something. Well i could see this being the case as well for unexpected period blood. In conclusion, this is why i feel ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation.

This convienance would mean more to the girls than i think they would even be able to communicate. Maybe not at first, but when it comes a point in time when they need it.

She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. 

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way. Band aids are used for blood, and toilet paper is used for cleaning. The two together are sort of what a tampon or pad serves for. I find tampons to also be just as necessary as the rest of the items. We all have to deal with blood at some point, so why not just deal with it conveniently? This convienance would mean more to the girls than i think they would even be able to communicate. Maybe not at first, but when it comes a point in time when they need it. Its like when you are trapped on the toilet with no toilet paper. Its like your stranded in a desert with no water or something. Well i could see this being the case as well for unexpected period blood. In conclusion, this is why i feel schools should provide f",user,31,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. 

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way. Band aids are used for blood, and toilet paper is used for cleaning. The two together are sort of what a tampon or pad serves for. I find tampons to also be just as necessary as the rest of the items. We all have to deal with blood at some point, so why not just deal with it conveniently? This convienance would mean more to the girls than i think they would even be able to communicate. Maybe not at first, but when it comes a point in time when they need it. Its like when you are trapped on the toilet with no toilet paper. Its like your stranded in a desert with no water or something. Well i could see this being the case as well for unexpected period blood. In conclusion, this is why i feel schools should provide free pads and",user,31,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
