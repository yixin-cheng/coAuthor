The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, it is hard to argue that current screen time usage is not a bad thing.  In my day to day life I see that people are more and more disengaged from the world around them.   They are more and more isolated, and they are less and less able to connect with others.  I see this in nearly every part of my life,   from the people I work with, to the people I meet in my travels, to the people I know in my personal life.  At school students are more interested in their phones than their classes and have to keep checking for updates.  At work people are more interested in their phones than their coworkers, a group at a lunch table will only be studying their phones, and not talking to each other.  At home my family will separate from each other and each go to their own room to watch TV or play games.  During sports games I see participants getting anxious that they have not looked at their phone for a number of minutes, and they will sneak away to check to see if they have missed anything.

At school students are more interested in their phones than their classes and have to keep checking for updates.  At work people are more interested in their phones than their coworkers, a group at a lunch table will only be studying their phones, and not talking to each other.

During sports games I see participants getting anxious that they have not looked at their phone for a number of minutes, and they will sneak away to check to see if they have missed anything.  The pandemic has made this worse, as many of us have been forced to use screens for nearly every part of our lives.

I see this in nearly every part of my life,   from the people I work with, to the people I meet in my travels, to the people I know in my personal life.  At school students are more interested in their phones than their classes and have to keep checking for updates.  At work people are more interested in their phones than their coworkers, a group at a lunch table will only be studying their phones, and not talking to each other.  At home my family will separate from each other and each go to their own room to watch TV or play games.  During sports games I see participants getting anxious that they have not looked at their phone for a number of minutes, and they will sneak away to check to see if they have missed anything.  The pandemic has made this worse, as many of us have been forced to use screens for nearly every part of our lives.  This has just accelerated a trend toward screens, and it seems like we've nearly reached the end point where people are completely disengaged from the world around them.

In my opinion, it is hard to argue that current screen time usage is not a bad thing.  In my day to day life I see that people are more and more disengaged from the world around them.   They are more and more isolated, and they are less and less able to connect with others.  I see this in nearly every part of my life,   from the people I work with, to the people I meet in my travels, to the people I know in my personal life.  At school students are more interested in their phones than their classes and have to keep checking for updates.  At work people are more interested in their phones than their coworkers, a group at a lunch table will only be studying their phones, and not talking to each other.  At home my family will separate from each other and each go to their own room to watch TV or play games.  During sports games I see participants getting anxious that they have not looked at their phone for a number of minutes, and they will sneak away to check to see if they have missed anything.  The pandemic has made this worse, as many of us have been forced to use screens for nearly every part of our lives.  This has just accelerated a trend toward screens, and it seems like we've nearly reached the end point where people are completely disengaged from the world around them.

In my opinion, it is hard to argue that current screen time usage is not a bad thing.  In my day to day life I see that people are more and more disengaged from the world around them.   They are more and more isolated, and they are less and less able to connect with others.  I see this in nearly every part of my life,   from the people I work with, to the people I meet in my travels, to the people I know in my personal life.  At school students are more interested in their phones than their classes and have to keep checking for updates.  At work people are more interested in their phones than their coworkers, a group at a lunch table will only be studying their phones, and not talking to each other.  At home my family will separate from each other and each go to their own room to watch TV or play games.  During sports games I see participants getting anxious that they have not looked at their phone for a number of minutes, and they will sneak away to check to see if they have missed anything.  The pandemic has made this worse, as many of us have been forced to use screens for nearly every part of our lives.  This has just accelerated a trend toward screens, and it seems like we've nearly reached the end point where people are completely disengaged from the world around them.  To me there is real hard, as people become dehumanized and empathize with others less and less as they become more and more isolated.  I am very sure that screen, at the rate we use them now, are not a good thing.  W",user,17,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, it is hard to argue that current screen time usage is not a bad thing.  In my day to day life I see that people are more and more disengaged from the world around them.   They are more and more isolated, and they are less and less able to connect with others.  I see this in nearly every part of my life,   from the people I work with, to the people I meet in my travels, to the people I know in my personal life.  At school students are more interested in their phones than their classes and have to keep checking for updates.  At work people are more interested in their phones than their coworkers, a group at a lunch table will only be studying their phones, and not talking to each other.  At home my family will separate from each other and each go to their own room to watch TV or play games.  During sports games I see participants getting anxious that they have not looked at their phone for a number of minutes, and they will sneak away to check to see if they have missed anything.  The pandemic has made this worse, as many of us have been forced to use screens for nearly every part of our lives.  This has just accelerated a trend toward screens, and it seems like we've nearly reached the end point where people are completely disengaged from the world around them.  To me there is real hard, as people become dehumanized and empathize with others less and less as they become more and more isolated.
