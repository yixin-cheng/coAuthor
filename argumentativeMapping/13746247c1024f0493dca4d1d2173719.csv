Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, some states' prefer to pretend that when it comes to older students sex does not exit. Period shaming is part of that benighted attitude. If anything with the word ""period"" or ""tampon"" appears in a school, then that school has failed in its duty to the state.

But what's the reality here?
The reality is that there are a lot of girls who have periods.
 The bloods gonna flow. It's a fact of life. And in schools where this reality is not addressed, girls with periods can become pariahs. If students judges others for clothing, poverty, race, and social class, what makes us think that girls having periods would not be attacked too?
TIfgirls are not given the tools to deal with their periods, they will be forced to deal with them in a way
 that demeans them and reinforces negative attitudes toward a spectrum of related gender and sexuality issues.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, some states' prefer to pretend that when it comes to older students sex does not exit. Period shaming is part of that benighted attitude. If anything with the word ""period"" or ""tampon"" appears in a school, then that school has failed in its duty to the state.

But what's the reality here?
The reality is that there are a lot of girls who have periods.
 The bloods gonna flow. It's a fact of life. And in schools where this reality is not addressed, girls with periods can become pariahs. If students judges others for clothing, poverty, race, and social class, what makes us think that girls having periods would not be attacked too?
TIfgirls are not given the tools to deal with their periods, they will be forced to deal with them in a way
 that demeans them and reinforces negative attitudes toward a spectrum of related gender and sexuality issues. Misogyny, poverty, LGBTQ rights: these are real issues in schools, and period poverty is yet another  way to reinforce the marginalization of what should be protected classes.

 The bloods gonna flow. It's a fact of life. And in schools where this reality is not addressed, girls with periods can become pariahs. If students judges others for clothing, poverty, race, and social class, what makes us think that girls having periods would not be attacked too?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, some states' prefer to pretend that when it comes to older students sex does not exit. Period shaming is part of that benighted attitude. If anything with the word ""period"" or ""tampon"" appears in a school, then that school has failed in its duty to the state.

But what's the reality here?
The reality is that there are a lot of girls who have periods.
 The bloods gonna flow. It's a fact of life. And in schools where this reality is not addressed, girls with periods can become pariahs. If students judges others for clothing, poverty, race, and social class, what makes us think that girls having periods would not be attacked too?
TIfgirls are not given the tools to deal with their periods, they will be forced to deal with them in a way
 that demeans them and reinforces negative attitudes toward a spectrum of related gender and sexuality issues. Misogyny, poverty, LGBTQ rights: these are real issues in schools, and period poverty is yet another  way to reinforce the marginalization of what should be protected classes.
The question is not whether schools should provide pads and tampons.
 Of course they should. But more deeply, will the schools try to protect the weak, the vulnerable, the disenfranchised, the loner? What is the life lesson that period-shaming victims are learning? That they don't count and will likely never count. That they are not worthy of protection. That they are not worthy of empathy. That they are not worthy of respect.

The reality is that there are a lot of girls who have periods.
 The bloods gonna flow. It's a fact of life. And in schools where this reality is not addressed, girls with periods can become pariahs. If students judges others for clothing, poverty, race, and social class, what makes us think that girls having periods would not be attacked too?
TIfgirls are not given the tools to deal with their periods, they will be forced to deal with them in a way
 that demeans them and reinforces negative attitudes toward a spectrum of related gender and sexuality issues. Misogyny, poverty, LGBTQ rights: these are real issues in schools, and period poverty is yet another  way to reinforce the marginalization of what should be protected classes.
The question is not whether schools should provide pads and tampons.
 Of course they should. But more deeply, will the schools try to protect the weak, the vulnerable, the disenfranchised, the loner? What is the life lesson that period-shaming victims are learning? That they don't count and will likely never count. That they are not worthy of protection. That they are not worthy of empathy. That they are not worthy of respect.

 Of course they should. But more deeply, will the schools try to protect the weak, the vulnerable, the disenfranchised, the loner? What is the life lesson that period-shaming victims are learning? That they don't count and will likely never count. That they are not worthy of protection. That they are not worthy of empathy. That they are not worthy of respect.

The reality is that there are a lot of girls who have periods.
 The bloods gonna flow. It's a fact of life. And in schools where this reality is not addressed, girls with periods can become pariahs. If students judges others for clothing, poverty, race, and social class, what makes us think that girls having periods would not be attacked too?

The question is not whether schools should provide pads and tampons.
 Of course they should. But more deeply, will the schools try to protect the weak, the vulnerable, the disenfranchised, the loner? What is the life lesson that period-shaming victims are learning? That they don't count and will likely never count. That they are not worthy of protection. That they are not worthy of empathy. That they are not worthy of respect.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, some states' prefer to pretend that when it comes to older students sex does not exit. Period shaming is part of that benighted attitude. If anything with the word ""period"" or ""tampon"" appears in a school, then that school has failed in its duty to the state.

But what's the reality here?
The reality is that there are a lot of girls who have periods.
 The blood will flow, t's a fact of life. And in schools where this reality is not addressed, girls with periods can become pariahs. If students judges others for clothing, poverty, race, and social class, what makes us think that girls having periods would not be attacked too?
TIfgirls are not given the tools to deal with their periods, they will be forced to deal with them in a way
 that demeans them and reinforces negative attitudes toward a spectrum of related gender and sexuality issues. Misogyny, poverty, LGBTQ rights: these are real issues in schools, and period poverty is yet another  way to reinforce the marginalization of what should be protected classes.
