How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

And you can't spend all your time in a car. The gas prices alone would cost you a fortune.

Luckily for us, technology has helped the dating scene. We are able to communicate via phone call, text, FaceTime, etc. There is also dating apps that can even help us meet the man or woman of our dreams.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has made romantic interactions better and has improved the dating scene. Just take technology out of the equation for a second. No phones, no internet. How do you keep in touch with your boyfriend or girlfriend if you're not living in the same area? You would have to drive just to have simple communication with them.   And you can't spend all your time in a car. The gas prices alone would cost you a fortune.

Luckily for us, technology has helped the dating scene. We are able to communicate via phone call, text, FaceTime, etc. There is also dating apps that can even help us meet the man or woman of our dreams.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has made romantic interactions better and has improved the dating scene. Just take technology out of the equation for a second. No phones, no internet. How do you keep in touch with your boyfriend or girlfriend if you're not living in the same area? You would have to drive just to have simple communication with them.   And you can't spend all your time in a car. The gas prices alone would cost you a fortune.

Luckily for us, technology has helped the dating scene. We are able to communicate via phone call, text, FaceTime, etc. There is also dating apps that can even help us meet the man or woman of our dreams. 

Technology has made it much easier to break the ice. It has made it easier to keep long distance relationships happy and healthy. I have used Tinder in the past and it takes a lot of the stress and anxiety out of the beginning stages of dating.

In my opinion, technology has made romantic interactions better and has improved the dating scene. Just take technology out of the equation for a second. No phones, no internet. How do you keep in touch with your boyfriend or girlfriend if you're not living in the same area? You would have to drive just to have simple communication with them.   And you can't spend all your time in a car. The gas prices alone would cost you a fortune.

Luckily for us, technology has helped the dating scene. We are able to communicate via phone call, text, FaceTime, etc. There is also dating apps that can even help us meet the man or woman of our dreams. 

Technology has made it much easier to break the ice. It has made it easier to keep long distance relationships happy and healthy. I have used Tinder in the past and it takes a lot of the stress and anxiety out of the beginning stages of dating.

And you can't spend all your time in a car. The gas prices alone would cost you a fortune.

Luckily for us, technology has helped the dating scene. We are able to communicate via phone call, text, FaceTime, etc. There is also dating apps that can even help us meet the man or woman of our dreams. 

Technology has made it much easier to break the ice. It has made it easier to keep long distance relationships happy and healthy. I have used Tinder in the past and it takes a lot of the stress and anxiety out of the beginning stages of dating.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

In my opinion, technology has made romantic interactions better and has improved the dating scene. Just take technology out of the equation for a second. No phones, no internet. How do you keep in touch with your boyfriend or girlfriend if you're not living in the same area? You would have to drive just to have simple communication with them.

Luckily for us, technology has helped the dating scene. We are able to communicate via phone call, text, FaceTime, etc. There is also dating apps that can even help us meet the man or woman of our dreams. 

Technology has made it much easier to break the ice. It has made it easier to keep long distance relationships happy and healthy. I have used Tinder in the past and it takes a lot of the stress and anxiety out of the beginning stages of dating.

Stranger Things and Outer Banks come to mind right away. Technology also allows us to take photos and videos of our experiences with our significant other which can create memories that last forever. Without those pictures and videos all we really can rely on is our memory.

Luckily for us, technology has helped the dating scene. We are able to communicate via phone call, text, FaceTime, etc. There is also dating apps that can even help us meet the man or woman of our dreams. 

Technology has made it much easier to break the ice. It has made it easier to keep long distance relationships happy and healthy. I have used Tinder in the past and it takes a lot of the stress and anxiety out of the beginning stages of dating.

Stranger Things and Outer Banks come to mind right away. Technology also allows us to take photos and videos of our experiences with our significant other which can create memories that last forever. Without those pictures and videos all we really can rely on is our memory.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

Technology has made it much easier to break the ice. It has made it easier to keep long distance relationships happy and healthy. I have used Tinder in the past and it takes a lot of the stress and anxiety out of the beginning stages of dating.

Without those pictures and videos all we really can rely on is our memory.
