One little known but egregious offender is a 1915 movie called ""The Birth of a Nation."" In that film there were many Blacks--played by Whites! Yikes! These ""Black"" men are portrayed as stupid. violent and sexually aggressive toward White women. The film was a huge success and is credited with helping to revive the Ku Klux Klan, who are portrayed as heroes.
The film was so popular that it was re-released in the 1930s and 1940s., and used as a recruiting tool by the KKK.
The film's director, D.W. Griffith, wthough he had much technical skill and advanced the art of cinema, as a lso avirulent racist who made many films that portrayed Blacks as stupid and violent.

TSadly, he Birth of a Nation was the first film to be screened at the White House.


So let's see. As recently as 80 years ago, most people in America seemed to countenance, if not support, offensive stereotypes of Backs. Today, there have been over 300 Black Americans killed by police officers since George Floyd's death.  o say there is not a link of causality here would be laughably specious.

The film was a huge success and is credited with helping to revive the Ku Klux Klan, who are portrayed as heroes.
The film was so popular that it was re-released in the 1930s and 1940s., and used as a recruiting tool by the KKK.
The film's director, D.W. Griffith, wthough he had much technical skill and advanced the art of cinema, as a lso avirulent racist who made many films that portrayed Blacks as stupid and violent.

One little known but egregious offender is a 1915 movie called ""The Birth of a Nation."" In that film there were many Blacks--played by Whites! Yikes! These ""Black"" men are portrayed as stupid. violent and sexually aggressive toward White women. The film was a huge success and is credited with helping to revive the Ku Klux Klan, who are portrayed as heroes.
The film was so popular that it was re-released in the 1930s and 1940s., and used as a recruiting tool by the KKK.
The film's director, D.W. Griffith, wthough he had much technical skill and advanced the art of cinema, as a lso avirulent racist who made many films that portrayed Blacks as stupid and violent.

TSadly, he Birth of a Nation was the first film to be screened at the White House.


So let's see. As recently as 80 years ago, most people in America seemed to countenance, if not support, offensive stereotypes of Backs. Today, there have been over 300 Black Americans killed by police officers since George Floyd's death.  o say there is not a link of causality here would be laughably specious.

Can anyone really argue that movements like Black Lives Matter are not vitally necessary?
I'm not saying that all cops are bad.
 My point is that there is a massive, subterranean pool of racism in the US that makes the fact that there are some racist cops inevitable.

And Birth of a Nation is far from the only benighted example in the world of cinema.
The list of movies that portray Blacks in a negative light is long and depressing.

One little known but egregious offender is a 1915 movie called ""The Birth of a Nation."" In that film there were many Blacks--played by Whites! Yikes! These ""Black"" men are portrayed as stupid. violent and sexually aggressive toward White women. The film was a huge success and is credited with helping to revive the Ku Klux Klan, who are portrayed as heroes.
The film was so popular that it was re-released in the 1930s and 1940s., and used as a recruiting tool by the KKK.
The film's director, D.W. Griffith, wthough he had much technical skill and advanced the art of cinema, as a lso avirulent racist who made many films that portrayed Blacks as stupid and violent.

TSadly, he Birth of a Nation was the first film to be screened at the White House.


So let's see. As recently as 80 years ago, most people in America seemed to countenance, if not support, offensive stereotypes of Backs. Today, there have been over 300 Black Americans killed by police officers since George Floyd's death.  o say there is not a link of causality here would be laughably specious.

One little known but egregious offender is a 1915 movie called ""The Birth of a Nation."" In that film there were many Blacks--played by Whites! Yikes! These ""Black"" men are portrayed as stupid. violent and sexually aggressive toward White women. The film was a huge success and is credited with helping to revive the Ku Klux Klan, who are portrayed as heroes.
The film was so popular that it was re-released in the 1930s and 1940s., and used as a recruiting tool by the KKK.
The film's director, D.W. Griffith, wthough he had much technical skill and advanced the art of cinema, as a lso avirulent racist who made many films that portrayed Blacks as stupid and violent.

TSadly, he Birth of a Nation was the first film to be screened at the White House.


So let's see. As recently as 80 years ago, most people in America seemed to countenance, if not support, offensive stereotypes of Backs. Today, there have been over 300 Black Americans killed by police officers since George Floyd's death.  o say there is not a link of causality here would be laughably specious.

Can anyone really argue that movements like Black Lives Matter are not vitally necessary?
I'm not saying that all cops are bad.
 My point is that there is a massive, subterranean pool of racism in the US that makes the fact that there are some racist cops inevitable.

One little known but egregious offender is a 1915 movie called ""The Birth of a Nation."" In that film there were many Blacks--played by Whites! Yikes! These ""Black"" men are portrayed as stupid. violent and sexually aggressive toward White women. The film was a huge success and is credited with helping to revive the Ku Klux Klan, who are portrayed as heroes.
The film was so popular that it was re-released in the 1930s and 1940s., and used as a recruiting tool by the KKK.
The film's director, D.W. Griffith, wthough he had much technical skill and advanced the art of cinema, as a lso avirulent racist who made many films that portrayed Blacks as stupid and violent.

TSadly, he Birth of a Nation was the first film to be screened at the White House.


So let's see. As recently as 80 years ago, most people in America seemed to countenance, if not support, offensive stereotypes of Backs. Today, there have been over 300 Black Americans killed by police officers since George Floyd's death.  o say there is not a link of causality here would be laughably specious.

Can anyone really argue that movements like Black Lives Matter are not vitally necessary?
I'm not saying that all cops are bad.
 My point is that there is a massive, subterranean pool of racism in the US that makes the fact that there are some racist cops inevitable.

And Birth of a Nation is far from the only benighted example in the world of cinema.

One little known but egregious offender is a 1915 movie called ""The Birth of a Nation."" In that film there were many Blacks--played by Whites! Yikes! These ""Black"" men are portrayed as stupid. violent and sexually aggressive toward White women. The film was a huge success and is credited with helping to revive the Ku Klux Klan, who are portrayed as heroes.
The film was so popular that it was re-released in the 1930s and 1940s., and used as a recruiting tool by the KKK.
The film's director, D.W. Griffith, wthough he had much technical skill and advanced the art of cinema, as a lso avirulent racist who made many films that portrayed Blacks as stupid and violent.

TSadly, he Birth of a Nation was the first film to be screened at the White House.


So let's see. As recently as 80 years ago, most people in America seemed to countenance, if not support, offensive stereotypes of Backs. Today, there have been over 300 Black Americans killed by police officers since George Floyd's death.  o say there is not a link of causality here would be laughably specious.

Can anyone really argue that movements like Black Lives Matter are not vitally necessary?

One little known but egregious offender is a 1915 movie called ""The Birth of a Nation."" In that film there were many Blacks--played by Whites! Yikes! These ""Black"" men are portrayed as stupid. violent and sexually aggressive toward White women. The film was a huge success and is credited with helping to revive the Ku Klux Klan, who are portrayed as heroes.
The film was so popular that it was re-released in the 1930s and 1940s., and used as a recruiting tool by the KKK.
The film's director, D.W. Griffith, wthough he had much technical skill and advanced the art of cinema, as a lso avirulent racist who made many films that portrayed Blacks as stupid and violent.

TSadly, he Birth of a Nation was the first film to be screened at the White House.


So let's see. As recently as 80 years ago, most people in America seemed to countenance, if not support, offensive stereotypes of Backs. Today, there have been over 300 Black Americans killed by police officers since George Floyd's death.  o say there is not a link of causality here would be laughably specious.

Can anyone really argue that movements like Black Lives Matter are not vitally necessary?
I'm not saying that all cops are bad.
 My point is that there is a massive, subterranean pool of racism in the US that makes the fact that there are some racist cops inevitable.

And Birth of a Nation is far from the only benighted example in the world of cinema.
The list of movies that portray Blacks in a negative light is long and depressing.
