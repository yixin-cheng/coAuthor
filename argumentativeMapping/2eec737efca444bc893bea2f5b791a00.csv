Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, I do not really think ""extreme sports"" should really even be called sports. Sports are competitive, and when you add that into extreme sports it really does make it dangerous because instead of taking extra precautions to make sure you are safe, you are trying to win.

I really think they should be more focus on being extreme hobbies instead. People can still do them, but if you remove the ""I must win"" aspect from them , then it will be a lot safer. Then it really could not be called a sport, but something people can do to team up with each other to help in making sure their friends (or team mates) are remaining safer from injury, or even death. 

So yes, I think it really is kind of selfish to call extreme sports a sport. Most sports teams don't really care about the other people on the other team. In extreme sports, that can be a huge problem because the risk involved is serious injury, or even accidental death. People can regret that afterwards, but the problem with that is that it is too late to do anything about it.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, I do not really think ""extreme sports"" should really even be called sports. Sports are competitive, and when you add that into extreme sports it really does make it dangerous because instead of taking extra precautions to make sure you are safe, you are trying to win.

I really think they should be more focus on being extreme hobbies instead. People can still do them, but if you remove the ""I must win"" aspect from them , then it will be a lot safer. Then it really could not be called a sport, but something people can do to team up with each other to help in making sure their friends (or team mates) are remaining safer from injury, or even death. 

So yes, I think it really is kind of selfish to call extreme sports a sport. Most sports teams don't really care about the other people on the other team.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, I do not really think ""extreme sports"" should really even be called sports. Sports are competitive, and when you add that into extreme sports it really does make it dangerous because instead of taking extra precautions to make sure you are safe, you are trying to win.

I really think they should be more focus on being extreme hobbies instead. People can still do them, but if you remove the ""I must win"" aspect from them , then it will be a lot safer. Then it really could not be called a sport, but something people can do to team up with each other to help in making sure their friends (or team mates) are remaining safer from injury, or even death. 

So yes, I think it really is kind of selfish to call extreme sports a sport. Most sports teams don't really care about the other people on the other team. In extreme sports, that can be a huge problem because the risk involved is serious injury, or even accidental death. People can regret that afterwards, but the problem with that is that it is too late to do anything about it.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, I do not really think ""extreme sports"" should really even be called sports. Sports are competitive, and when you add that into extreme sports it really does make it dangerous because instead of taking extra precautions to make sure you are safe, you are trying to win.

I really think they should be more focus on being extreme hobbies instead. People can still do them, but if you remove the ""I must win"" aspect from them , then it will be a lot safer. Then it really could not be called a sport, but something people can do to team up with each other to help in making sure their friends (or team mates) are remaining safer from injury, or even death. 

So yes, I think it really is kind of selfish to call extreme sports a sport. Most sports teams don't really care about the other people on the other team. In extreme sports, that can be a huge problem because the risk involved is serious injury, or even accidental death. People can regret that afterwards, but the problem with that is that it is too late to do anything about it.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, I do not really think ""extreme sports"" should really even be called sports. Sports are competitive, and when you add that into extreme sports it really does make it dangerous because instead of taking extra precautions to make sure you are safe, you are trying to win.

I really think they should be more focus on being extreme hobbies instead. People can still do them, but if you remove the ""I must win"" aspect from them , then it will be a lot safer. Then it really could not be called a sport, but something people can do to team up with each other to help in making sure their friends (or team mates) are remaining safer from injury, or even death. 

So yes, I think it really is kind of selfish to call extreme sports a sport. Most sports teams don't really care about the other people on the other team. In extreme sports, that can be a huge problem because the risk involved is serious injury, or even accidental death. People can regret that afterwards, but the problem with that is that it is too late to do anything about it. 

Extreme sports are very dangerous, much more so than none extreme sports. People more than likely won't die playing football or baseba",user,15,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
