In my opinion, paying college athletes is an excellent idea. 
For one, I think it would help provide a more stable future for many student-athletes.
 It is well-known that a good amount of student athletes don't go on to play for the pros after college, and those that do, aren't guaranteed a very high salary or even a job in the field they played. 
The best example to use in terms of the advantages of paying college players is the University of Tennessee's football program.
 The university benefits from their players in promos, ticket sales, and other perks that allow the school to generate positive funds. Students who are lucky enough to be a part of the team can receive just about anything they ask for off the field and still receive free tuition, room, board, and the opportunity to be on a university team. If a player gets injured, that player is also provided with insurance, along with a stipend for their education. 

If this same system were implemented in the United States, many colleges would be able to provide the same service tthe University of Tennessee implements. ot only does paying college athletes create a more stable future for student-athletes, but it also creates a more fair society where those
 who make the most money for their schools, get the most amount of money back from their schools. 

College sports can also be seen as a leveler, where kids who couldn't afford to play for professional teams would have an opportunity to play for prestigious college teams. If college athletes were paid, it could lead to all kinds of new talent for universities and professional sports teams, which would be very difficult to ignore.

 who make the most money for their schools, get the most amount of money back from their schools. 

College sports can also be seen as a leveler, where kids who couldn't afford to play for professional teams would have an opportunity to play for prestigious college teams. If college athletes were paid, it could lead to all kinds of new talent for universities and professional sports teams, which would be very difficult to ignore.

In my opinion, paying college athletes is an excellent idea. 
For one, I think it would help provide a more stable future for many student-athletes.
 It is well-known that a good amount of student athletes don't go on to play for the pros after college, and those that do, aren't guaranteed a very high salary or even a job in the field they played. 
The best example to use in terms of the advantages of paying college players is the University of Tennessee's football program.
 The university benefits from their players in promos, ticket sales, and other perks that allow the school to generate positive funds. Students who are lucky enough to be a part of the team can receive just about anything they ask for off the field and still receive free tuition, room, board, and the opportunity to be on a university team. If a player gets injured, that player is also provided with insurance, along with a stipend for their education.

If college athletes were paid, it could lead to all kinds of new talent for universities and professional sports teams, which would be very difficult to ignore.

College sports can also be seen as a leveler, where kids who couldn't afford to play for professional teams would have an opportunity to play for prestigious college teams.

In my opinion, paying college athletes is an excellent idea. 
For one, I think it would help provide a more stable future for many student-athletes.
 It is well-known that a good amount of student athletes don't go on to play for the pros after college, and those that do, aren't guaranteed a very high salary or even a job in the field they played. 
The best example to use in terms of the advantages of paying college players is the UAustralias fsoccerpand rugby rogram.s. The universities benefit from their players in promos, ticket sales, and other perks that allow the school to generate positive funds. Students who are lucky enough to be a part of the team can receive just about anything they ask for off the field and still receive free tuition, room, board, and the opportunity to be on a university team. If a player gets injured, that player is also provided with insurance, along with a stipend for their education. 

Athletes can gain endorsement money, and do advertising for companies. They can capitalize on the popularity of their images, and their place on the school's team. 

If this same system were implemented in the United States, many colleges would be able to provide the same service that the Australia implements. ot only does paying college athletes create a more stable future for student-athletes, but it also creates a more fair society where those
 who make the most money for their schools, get the most amount of money back from their schools. 

College sports can also be seen as a leveler, where kids who couldn't afford to play for professional teams would have an opportunity to play for prestigious college teams. If college athletes were paid, it could lead to all kinds of new talent for universities and professional sports teams, which would be very difficult to ignore.

In my opinion, paying college athletes is an excellent idea. 
For one, I think it would help provide a more stable future for many student-athletes.
 It is well-known that a good amount of student athletes don't go on to play for the pros after college, and those that do, aren't guaranteed a very high salary or even a job in the field they played. 
The best example to use in terms of the advantages of paying college players is the UAustralias fsoccerpand rugby rogram.s. The universities benefit from their players in promos, ticket sales, and other perks that allow the school to generate positive funds. Students who are lucky enough to be a part of the team can receive just about anything they ask for off the field and still receive free tuition, room, board, and the opportunity to be on a university team. If a player gets injured, that player is also provided with insurance, along with a stipend for their education. 

Athletes can gain endorsement money, and do advertising for companies. They can capitalize on the popularity of their images, and their place on the school's team. 

If this same system were implemented in the United States, many colleges would be able to provide the same service that the Australia implements. ot only does paying college athletes create a more stable future for student-athletes, but it also creates a more fair society where those
 who make the most money for their schools, get the most amount of money back from their schools. 

College sports can also be seen as a leveler, where kids who couldn't afford to play for professional teams would have an opportunity to play for prestigious college teams. If college athletes were paid, it could lead to all kinds of new talent for universities and professional sports teams, which would be very difficult to ignore.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In my opinion, paying college athletes is an excellent idea. 
For one, I think it would help provide a more stable future for many student-athletes.
 It is well-known that a good amount of student athletes don't go on to play for the pros after college, and those that do, aren't guaranteed a very high salary or even a job in the field they played. 
The best example to use in terms of the advantages of paying college players is the UAustralias fsoccerpand rugby rogram.s. The universities benefit from their players in promos, ticket sales, and other perks that allow the school to generate positive funds. Students who are lucky enough to be a part of the team can receive just about anything they ask for off the field and still receive free tuition, room, board, and the opportunity to be on a university team. If a player gets injured, that player is also provided with insurance, along with a stipend for their education. 

Athletes can gain endorsement money, and do advertising for companies. They can capitalize on the popularity of their images, and their place on the school's team. 

If this same system were implemented in the United States, many colleges would be able to provide the same service that the Australia implements. ot only does paying college athletes create a more stable future for student-athletes, but it also creates a more fair society where those
 who make the most money for their schools, get the most amount of money back from their schools. 

College sports can also be seen as a leveler, where kids who couldn't afford to play for professional teams would have an opportunity to play for prestigious college teams. If college athletes were paid, it could lead to all kinds of new talent for universities and professional sports teams, which would be very difficult to ignore.

In my opinion, paying college athletes is an excellent idea. 
For one, I think it would help provide a more stable future for many student-athletes.
 It is well-known that a good amount of student athletes don't go on to play for the pros after college, and those that do, aren't guaranteed a very high salary or even a job in the field they played. 
The best example to use in terms of the advantages of paying college players is the UAustralias fsoccerpand rugby rogram.s. The universities benefit from their players in promos, ticket sales, and other perks that allow the school to generate positive funds. Students who are lucky enough to be a part of the team can receive just about anything they ask for off the field and still receive free tuition, room, board, and the opportunity to be on a university team.

In my opinion, paying college athletes is an excellent idea. 
For one, I think it would help provide a more stable future for many student-athletes.
 It is well-known that a good amount of student athletes don't go on to play for the pros after college, and those that do, aren't guaranteed a very high salary or even a job in the field they played. 
The best example to use in terms of the advantages of paying college players is the UAustralias fsoccerpand rugby rogram.s. The universities benefit from their players in promos, ticket sales, and other perks that allow the school to generate positive funds. Students who are lucky enough to be a part of the team can receive just about anything they ask for off the field and still receive free tuition, room, board, and the opportunity to be on a university team. If a player gets injured, that player is also provided with insurance, along with a stipend for their education. 

Athletes can gain endorsement money, and do advertising for companies. They can capitalize on the popularity of their images, and their place on the school's team. 

If this same system were implemented in the United States, many colleges would be able to provide the same service that the Australia implements. ot only does paying college athletes create a more stable future for student-athletes, but it also creates a more fair society where those
 who make the most money for their schools, get the most amount of money back from their schools. 

College sports can also be seen as a leveler, where kids who couldn't afford to play for professional teams would have an opportunity to play for prestigious college teams. If college athletes were paid, it could lead to all kinds of new talent for universities and professional sports teams, which would be very difficult to ignore.

Students who are lucky enough to be a part of the team can receive just about anything they ask for off the field and still receive free tuition, room, board, and the opportunity to be on a university team.

Athletes can gain endorsement money, and do advertising for companies. They can capitalize on the popularity of their images, and their place on the school's team.

College sports can also be seen as a leveler, where kids who couldn't afford to play for professional teams would have an opportunity to play for prestigious college teams.

For one, I think it would help provide a more stable future for many student-athletes.
 It is well-known that a good amount of student athletes don't go on to play for the pros after college, and those that do, aren't guaranteed a very high salary or even a job in the field they played. 
The best example to use in terms of the advantages of paying college players is the UAustralias fsoccerpand rugby rogram.s. The universities benefit from their players in promos, ticket sales, and other perks that allow the school to generate positive funds. Students who are lucky enough to be a part of the team can receive just about anything they ask for off the field and still receive free tuition, room, board, and the opportunity to be on a university team. If a player gets injured, that player is also provided with insurance, along with a stipend for their education. 

Athletes can gain endorsement money, and do advertising for companies. They can capitalize on the popularity of their images, and their place on the school's team. 

If this same system were implemented in the United States, many colleges would be able to provide the same service that the Australia implements. ot only does paying college athletes create a more stable future for student-athletes, but it also creates a more fair society where those
 who make the most money for their schools, get the most amount of money back from their schools. 

College sports can also be seen as a leveler, where kids who couldn't afford to play for professional teams would have an opportunity to play for prestigious college teams. If college athletes were paid, it could lead to all kinds of new talent for universities and professional sports teams, which would be very difficult to ignore. 

It would be advantageous to pay our athletes, to repay them for their efforts, and to give them more opportunities.  It's time we overhauled the system an

It would be advantageous to pay our athletes, to repay them for their efforts, and to give them more opportunities.  It's time we overhauled the system and followed the lead of other countries in college sports!

In my opinion, paying college athletes is an excellent idea. 
For one, I think it would help provide a more stable future for many student-athletes.
 It is well-known that a good amount of student athletes don't go on to play for the pros after college, and those that do, aren't guaranteed a very high salary or even a job in the field they played. 
The best example to use in terms of the advantages of paying college players is the UAustralias fsoccerpand rugby rogram.s. The universities benefit from their players in promos, ticket sales, and other perks that allow the school to generate positive funds. Students who are lucky enough to be a part of the team can receive just about anything they ask for off the field and still receive free tuition, room, board, and the opportunity to be on a university team. If a player gets injured, that player is also provided with insurance, along with a stipend for their education. There is almost total endor

Athletes can gain endorsement money, and do advertising for companies. They can capitalize on the popularity of their images, and their place on the school's team. 

If this same system were implemented in the United States, many colleges would be able to provide the same service that the Australia implements. ot only does paying college athletes create a more stable future for student-athletes, but it also creates a more fair society where those
 who make the most money for their schools, get the most amount of money back from their schools. 

College sports can also be seen as a leveler, where kids who couldn't afford to play for professional teams would have an opportunity to play for prestigious college teams. If college athletes were paid, it could lead to all kinds of new talent for universities and professional sports teams, which would be very difficult to ignore. 

It would be advantageous to pay our athletes, to repay them for their efforts, and to give them more opportunities.  It's time we overhauled the system and followed the lead of other countries in college sports!

In my opinion, paying college athletes is an excellent idea. 
For one, I think it would help provide a more stable future for many student-athletes.
 It is well-known that a good amount of student athletes don't go on to play for the pros after college, and those that do, aren't guaranteed a very high salary or even a job in the field they played. 
The best example to use in terms of the advantages of paying college players is the UAustralias fsoccerpand rugby rogram.s.

Athletes can gain endorsement money, and do advertising for companies. They can capitalize on the popularity of their images, and their place on the school's team.

College sports can also be seen as a leveler, where kids who couldn't afford to play for professional teams would have an opportunity to play for prestigious college teams. If college athletes were paid, it could lead to all kinds of new talent for universities and professional sports teams, which would be very difficult to ignore. 

It would be advantageous to pay our athletes, to repay them for their efforts, and to give them more opportunities.  It's time we overhauled the system and followed the lead of other countries in college sports!

In my opinion, paying college athletes is an excellent idea. 
For one, I think it would help provide a more stable future for many student-athletes.
 It is well-known that a good amount of student athletes don't go on to play for the pros after college, and those that do, aren't guaranteed a very high salary or even a job in the field they played. 
The best example to use in terms of the advantages of paying college players is the UAustralias fsoccerpand rugby rogram.s. The universities benefit from their players in promos, ticket sales, and other perks that allow the school to generate positive funds. Students who are lucky enough to be a part of the team can receive just about anything they ask for off the field and still receive free tuition, room, board, and the opportunity to be on a university team. If a player gets injured, that player is also provided with insurance, along with a stipend for their education.  

Additionally, athletes can gain endorsement money, and do advertising for companies. They can capitalize on the popularity of their images, and their place on the school's team. There is wide this program by all players.

If this same system were implemented in the United States, many colleges would be able to provide the same service that the Australia implements. ot only does paying college athletes create a more stable future for student-athletes, but it also creates a more fair society where those
 who make the most money for their schools, get the most amount of money back from their schools. 

College sports can also be seen as a leveler, where kids who couldn't afford to play for professional teams would have an opportunity to play for prestigious college teams. If college athletes were paid, it could lead to all kinds of new talent for universities and professional sports teams, which would be very difficult to ignore. 

It would be advantageous to pay our athletes, to repay them for their efforts, and to give them more opportunities.  It's time we overhauled the system and followed the lead of other countries in college sports!

In my opinion, paying college athletes is an excellent idea. 
For one, I think it would help provide a more stable future for many student-athletes.
 It is well-known that a good amount of student athletes don't go on to play for the pros after college, and those that do, aren't guaranteed a very high salary or even a job in the field they played. 
The best example to use in terms of the advantages of paying college players is the UAustralias fsoccerpand rugby rogram.s. The universities benefit from their players in promos, ticket sales, and other perks that allow the school to generate positive funds. Students who are lucky enough to be a part of the team can receive just about anything they ask for off the field and still receive free tuition, room, board, and the opportunity to be on a university team. If a player gets injured, that player is also provided with insurance, along with a stipend for their education.  

Additionally, athletes can gain endorsement money, and do advertising for companies. They can capitalize on the popularity of their images, and their place on the school's team. There is widespread satis this program by all players.

If this same system were implemented in the United States, many colleges would be able to provide the same service that the Australia implements. ot only does paying college athletes create a more stable future for student-athletes, but it also creates a more fair society where those

For one, I think it would help provide a more stable future for many student-athletes.
 It is well-known that a good amount of student athletes don't go on to play for the pros after college, and those that do, aren't guaranteed a very high salary or even a job in the field they played.
