I think this is more important than learning facts in a textbook, which might be circumstantial and not useful in many applications, or grades that are given based on it which only serve to gauge performance in specific metrics. 

The most important thing that I have learned in school is being able to persevere and also confine in my abilities as well as the skills and expertise of others.

Throughout life, there will no doubt be unexpected situations or stressful periods of time that ultimately challenges a person. Learning how to handle these situations is crucial to ones success in school as well as later on in life.
