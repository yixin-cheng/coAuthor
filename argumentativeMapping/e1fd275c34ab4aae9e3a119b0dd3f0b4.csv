I am not saying sports athletes are not brave, but I think some sports athletes would try to do something that would guarantee harm. It should be clear what makes the activity a sport.

I am not saying sports athletes are not brave, but I think some sports athletes would try to do something that would guarantee harm. It should be clear what makes the activity a sport. That poses the question, what makes something a sport?
There are four main questions to consider when trying to pull something from being a sport: the athlete, the competitor, spectators and equipment.
 But what about intention? It is the intention that makes the sport, not the consequences. What is the goal of the activity? 

Also, the history of the sport has a lot to do with if something should be considered a sport or not. For example, Sumo wrestling is a sport because it has been around for a very long time. It is very much a part of Japanese heritage. On the other hand, parkour , which is more of a stunt sport, is only about twenty years of age. Hav",user,16,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, I think some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. I am not saying sports athletes are not brave, but I think some sports athletes would try to do something that would guarantee harm. It should be clear what makes the activity a sport. That poses the question, what makes something a sport?
There are four main questions to consider when trying to pull something from being a sport: the athlete, the competitor, spectators and equipment.
 But what about intention? It is the intention that makes the sport, not the consequences. What is the goal of the activity? 

Also, the history of the sport has a lot to do with if something should be considered a sport or not. For example, Sumo wrestling is a sport because it has been around for a very long time. It is very much a part of Japanese heritage. On the other hand, parkour , which is more of a stunt sport, is only about twenty years of age. Having little to no history makes it hard to say if the activity is a sport. It is more of a fad that could disappear in no time. Is skateboarding ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, I think some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. I am not saying sports athletes are not brave, but I think some sports athletes would try to do something that would guarantee harm. It should be clear what makes the activity a sport. That poses the question, what makes something a sport?
There are four main questions to consider when trying to pull something from being a sport: the athlete, the competitor, spectators and equipment.
 But what about intention? It is the intention that makes the sport, not the consequences. What is the goal of the activity? 

Also, the history of the sport has a lot to do with if something should be considered a sport or not. For example, Sumo wrestling is a sport because it has been around for a very long time. It is very much a part of Japanese heritage. On the other hand, parkour , which is more of a stunt sport, is only about twenty years of age. Having little to no history makes it hard to say if the activity is a sport. It is more of a fad that could disappear in no time. Is skateboarding a sport? This is never heard of before the 1960s. Now, it is extremely popular. In my opinion, parkour and skateboarding is more about being cool more than it is a sport.

In my opinion, I think some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. I am not saying sports athletes are not brave, but I think some sports athletes would try to do something that would guarantee harm. It should be clear what makes the activity a sport. That poses the question, what makes something a sport?
There are four main questions to consider when trying to pull something from being a sport: the athlete, the competitor, spectators and equipment.
 But what about intention? It is the intention that makes the sport, not the consequences. What is the goal of the activity? 

Also, the history of the sport has a lot to do with if something should be considered a sport or not. For example, Sumo wrestling is a sport because it has been around for a very long time. It is very much a part of Japanese heritage. On the other hand, parkour , which is more of a stunt sport, is only about twenty years of age. Having little to no history makes it hard to say if the activity is a sport. It is more of a fad that could disappear in no time. Is skateboarding a sport? This is never heard of before the 1960s. Now, it is extremely popular. In my opinion, parkour and skateboarding is more about being cool more than it is a sport.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

There are four main questions to consider when trying to pull something from being a sport: the athlete, the competitor, spectators and equipment.

It is very much a part of Japanese heritage. On the other hand, parkour , which is more of a stunt sport, is only about twenty years of age. Having little to no history makes it hard to say if the activity is a sport. It is more of a fad that could disappear in no time. Is skateboarding a sport? This is never heard of before the 1960s.

There are four main questions to consider when trying to pull something from being a sport: the athlete, the competitor, spectators and equipment.
 But what about intention? It is the intention that makes the sport, not the consequences. What is the goal of the activity?

Having little to no history makes it hard to say if the activity is a sport. It is more of a fad that could disappear in no time. Is skateboarding a sport? This is never heard of before the 1960s. Now, it is extremely popular. In my opinion, parkour and skateboarding is more about being cool more than it is a sport.

In my opinion, I think some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. I am not saying sports athletes are not brave, but I think some sports athletes would try to do something that would guarantee harm. It should be clear what makes the activity a sport. That poses the question, what makes something a sport?
There are four main questions to consider when trying to pull something from being a sport: the athlete, the competitor, spectators and equipment.
 But what about intention? It is the intention that makes the sport, not the consequences. What is the goal of the activity? 

Also, the history of the sport has a lot to do with if something should be considered a sport or not. For example, Sumo wrestling is a sport because it has been around for a very long time. It is very much a part of Japanese heritage. On the other hand, parkour , which is more of a stunt sport, is only about twenty years of age. Having little to no history makes it hard to say if the activity is a sport. It is more of a fad that could disappear in no time. Is skateboarding a sport? This is never heard of before the 1960s. Now, it is extremely popular. In my opinion, parkour and skateboarding is more about being cool more than it is a sport.

I am not saying sports athletes are not brave, but I think some sports athletes would try to do something that would guarantee harm. It should be clear what makes the activity a sport. That poses the question, what makes something a sport?
There are four main questions to consider when trying to pull something from being a sport: the athlete, the competitor, spectators and equipment.
 But what about intention? It is the intention that makes the sport, not the consequences. What is the goal of the activity? 

Also, the history of the sport has a lot to do with if something should be considered a sport or not. For example, Sumo wrestling is a sport because it has been around for a very long time. It is very much a part of Japanese heritage. On the other hand, parkour , which is more of a stunt sport, is only about twenty years of age. Having little to no history makes it hard to say if the activity is a sport. It is more of a fad that could disappear in no time. Is skateboarding a sport? This is never heard of before the 1960s. Now, it is extremely popular. In my opinion, parkour and skateboarding is more about being cool more than it is a sport.
The people who do a sport is also important.
 They should be of the highest caliber, including physical ability and character as well. If a person is too risky and too ambitious, these are not the kinds of people who would end up in a sport. A good athlete is a responsible, safe, and upstandin",user,25,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

There are four main questions to consider when trying to pull something from being a sport: the athlete, the competitor, spectators and equipment.
 But what about intention? It is the intention that makes the sport, not the consequences. What is the goal of the activity? 

Also, the history of the sport has a lot to do with if something should be considered a sport or not. For example, Sumo wrestling is a sport because it has been around for a very long time. It is very much a part of Japanese heritage. On the other hand, parkour , which is more of a stunt sport, is only about twenty years of age. Having little to no history makes it hard to say if the activity is a sport. It is more of a fad that could disappear in no time. Is skateboarding a sport? This is never heard of before the 1960s. Now, it is extremely popular. In my opinion, parkour and skateboarding is more about being cool more than it is a sport.
The people who do a sport is also important.
 They should be of the highest caliber, including physical ability and character as well. If a person is too risky and too ambitious, these are not the kinds of people who would end up in a sport.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, I think some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. I am not saying sports athletes are not brave, but I think some sports athletes would try to do something that would guarantee harm. It should be clear what makes the activity a sport. That poses the question, what makes something a sport?
There are four main questions to consider when trying to pull something from being a sport: the athlete, the competitor, spectators and equipment.
 But what about intention? It is the intention that makes the sport, not the consequences. What is the goal of the activity? 

Also, the history of the sport has a lot to do with if something should be considered a sport or not. For example, Sumo wrestling is a sport because it has been around for a very long time. It is very much a part of Japanese heritage. On the other hand, parkour , which is more of a stunt sport, is only about twenty years of age. Having little to no history makes it hard to say if the activity is a sport. It is more of a fad that could disappear in no time. Is skateboarding a sport? This is never heard of before the 1960s. Now, it is extremely popular. In my opinion, parkour and skateboarding is more about being cool more than it is a sport.
The people who do a sport is also important.
 They should be of the highest caliber, including physical ability and character as well. If a person is too risky and too ambitious, these are not the kinds of people who would end up in a sport.

In my opinion, I think some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. I am not saying sports athletes are not brave, but I think some sports athletes would try to do something that would guarantee harm. It should be clear what makes the activity a sport. That poses the question, what makes something a sport?
There are four main questions to consider when trying to pull something from being a sport: the athlete, the competitor, spectators and equipment.
 But what about intention? It is the intention that makes the sport, not the consequences. What is the goal of the activity? 

Also, the history of the sport has a lot to do with if something should be considered a sport or not. For example, Sumo wrestling is a sport because it has been around for a very long time. It is very much a part of Japanese heritage. On the other hand, parkour , which is more of a stunt sport, is only about twenty years of age. Having little to no history makes it hard to say if the activity is a sport. It is more of a fad that could disappear in no time. Is skateboarding a sport? This is never heard of before the 1960s. Now, it is extremely popular. In my opinion, parkour and skateboarding is more about being cool more than it is a sport.
The people who do a sport is also important.
 They should be of the highest caliber, including physical ability and character as well. If a person is too risky and too ambitious, these are not the kinds of people who would end up in a sport. A good athlete is a responsible, safe, and upstanding member of the community. Sportsmen are not arrogant, and do not use violence.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, I think some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. I am not saying sports athletes are not brave, but I think some sports athletes would try to do something that would guarantee harm. It should be clear what makes the activity a sport.

There are four main questions to consider when trying to pull something from being a sport: the athlete, the competitor, spectators and equipment.
 But what about intention? It is the intention that makes the sport, not the consequences. What is the goal of the activity? 

Also, the history of the sport has a lot to do with if something should be considered a sport or not. For example, Sumo wrestling is a sport because it has been around for a very long time. It is very much a part of Japanese heritage. On the other hand, parkour , which is more of a stunt sport, is only about twenty years of age. Having little to no history makes it hard to say if the activity is a sport. It is more of a fad that could disappear in no time. Is skateboarding a sport? This is never heard of before the 1960s.

In my opinion, I think some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. I am not saying sports athletes are not brave, but I think some sports athletes would try to do something that would guarantee harm. It should be clear what makes the activity a sport. That poses the question, what makes something a sport?
There are four main questions to consider when trying to pull something from being a sport: the athlete, the competitor, spectators and equipment.
 But what about intention? It is the intention that makes the sport, not the consequences. What is the goal of the activity? 

Also, the history of the sport has a lot to do with if something should be considered a sport or not. For example, Sumo wrestling is a sport because it has been around for a very long time. It is very much a part of Japanese heritage. On the other hand, parkour , which is more of a stunt sport, is only about twenty years of age. Having little to no history makes it hard to say if the activity is a sport. It is more of a fad that could disappear in no time. Is skateboarding a sport? This is never heard of before the 1960s. Now, it is extremely popular. In my opinion, parkour and skateboarding is more about being cool more than it is a sport.
The people who do a sport is also important.
 They should be of the highest caliber, including physical ability and character as well. If a person is too risky and too ambitious, these are not the kinds of people who would end up in a sport. A good athlete is a responsible, safe, and upstanding member of the community. Sportsmen are not arrogant, and do not use violence.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

800,text-insert,"Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, I think some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. I am not saying sports athletes are not brave, but I think some sports athletes would try to do something that would guarantee harm. It should be clear what makes the activity a sport. That poses the question, what makes something a sport?
There are four main questions to consider when trying to pull something from being a sport: the athlete, the competitor, spectators and equipment.
 But what about intention? It is the intention that makes the sport, not the consequences. What is the goal of the activity? 

Also, the history of the sport has a lot to do with if something should be considered a sport or not. For example, Sumo wrestling is a sport because it has been around for a very long time. It is very much a part of Japanese heritage. On the other hand, parkour , which is more of a stunt sport, is only about twenty years of age. Having little to no history makes it hard to say if the activity is a sport. It is more of a fad that could disappear in no time. Is skateboarding a sport? This is never heard of before the 1960s. Now, it is extremely popular. In my opinion, parkour and skateboarding is more about being cool more than it is a sport.
