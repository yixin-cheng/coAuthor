In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the three Rs: Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. I know this sounds kind of old school, and I do believe there are many other things students should be taught that they aren't, but honestly, we do need this in our everyday life! Where would we be if we could not read or write? And basic arithmetic is used everyday! I know I use it everyday!

If a student does not learn how to read or write, what kind of job could they ever get? How could you go about daily life? If you don't know math, how do you budget? Or know what something will cost if it is 20% off? These are skills that we are able to use without even thinking about them. This is because we have started learning these skills since before we even went to school!

I know many kids in school think they will never use math once they are out of school, but they use it when they do not even realize it. If a child does not learn how to read or write, how would they function. Think about cell phones now. We read texts on them every day. We write texts on them every day. These are skills that are needed in this day and age.

Or know what something will cost if it is 20% off? These are skills that we are able to use without even thinking about them. This is because we have started learning these skills since before we even went to school!

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the three Rs: Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. I know this sounds kind of old school, and I do believe there are many other things students should be taught that they aren't, but honestly, we do need this in our everyday life! Where would we be if we could not read or write? And basic arithmetic is used everyday! I know I use it everyday!

If a student does not learn how to read or write, what kind of job could they ever get? How could you go about daily life? If you don't know math, how do you budget? Or know what something will cost if it is 20% off? These are skills that we are able to use without even thinking about them. This is because we have started learning these skills since before we even went to school!

I know many kids in school think they will never use math once they are out of school, but they use it when they do not even realize it. If a child does not learn how to read or write, how would they function. Think about cell phones now. We read texts on them every day. We write texts on them every day. These are skills that are needed in this day and age.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the three Rs: Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. I know this sounds kind of old school, and I do believe there are many other things students should be taught that they aren't, but honestly, we do need this in our everyday life! Where would we be if we could not read or write? And basic arithmetic is used everyday! I know I use it everyday!

If a student does not learn how to read or write, what kind of job could they ever get? How could you go about daily life? If you don't know math, how do you budget? Or know what something will cost if it is 20% off? These are skills that we are able to use without even thinking about them. This is because we have started learning these skills since before we even went to school!

I know many kids in school think they will never use math once they are out of school, but they use it when they do not even realize it. If a child does not learn how to read or write, how would they function. Think about cell phones now. We read texts on them every day. We write texts on them every day.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the three Rs: Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. I know this sounds kind of old school, and I do believe there are many other things students should be taught that they aren't, but honestly, we do need this in our everyday life! Where would we be if we could not read or write? And basic arithmetic is used everyday! I know I use it everyday!

If a student does not learn how to read or write, what kind of job could they ever get? How could you go about daily life? If you don't know math, how do you budget? Or know what something will cost if it is 20% off? These are skills that we are able to use without even thinking about them.

If a child does not learn how to read or write, how would they function. Think about cell phones now. We read texts on them every day. We write texts on them every day. These are skills that are needed in this day and age. 
I know that there are many other things that students should learn in school, but these are the most important.

I know many kids in school think they will never use math once they are out of school, but they use it when they do not even realize it. If a child does not learn how to read or write, how would they function. Think about cell phones now. We read texts on them every day. We write texts on them every day. These are skills that are needed in this day and age. 
I know that there are many other things that students should learn in school, but these are the most important.
 On top of these skills they should be taught basic life skills. Skills such as writing a check, applying for a mortgage, doing their taxes. But none of this could be done if they had not already allowed been taught reading, writing and arithmetic!
I know that I have learned many things in school that I will never use in my life.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the three Rs: Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. I know this sounds kind of old school, and I do believe there are many other things students should be taught that they aren't, but honestly, we do need this in our everyday life! Where would we be if we could not read or write? And basic arithmetic is used everyday! I know I use it everyday!

If a student does not learn how to read or write, what kind of job could they ever get? How could you go about daily life? If you don't know math, how do you budget? Or know what something will cost if it is 20% off? These are skills that we are able to use without even thinking about them. This is because we have started learning these skills since before we even went to school!

I know many kids in school think they will never use math once they are out of school, but they use it when they do not even realize it. If a child does not learn how to read or write, how would they function. Think about cell phones now. We read texts on them every day. We write texts on them every day.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the three Rs: Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. I know this sounds kind of old school, and I do believe there are many other things students should be taught that they aren't, but honestly, we do need this in our everyday life! Where would we be if we could not read or write? And basic arithmetic is used everyday! I know I use it everyday!

If a student does not learn how to read or write, what kind of job could they ever get? How could you go about daily life? If you don't know math, how do you budget? Or know what something will cost if it is 20% off? These are skills that we are able to use without even thinking about them. This is because we have started learning these skills since before we even went to school!

I know many kids in school think they will never use math once they are out of school, but they use it when they do not even realize it. If a child does not learn how to read or write, how would they function. Think about cell phones now. We read texts on them every day. We write texts on them every day. These are skills that are needed in this day and age. 
I know that there are many other things that students should learn in school, but these are the most important.
 On top of these skills they should be taught basic life skills. Skills such as writing a check, applying for a mortgage, doing their taxes. But none of this could be done if they had not already allowed been taught reading, writing and arithmetic!

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the three Rs: Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. I know this sounds kind of old school, and I do believe there are many other things students should be taught that they aren't, but honestly, we do need this in our everyday life! Where would we be if we could not read or write? And basic arithmetic is used everyday! I know I use it everyday!

If a student does not learn how to read or write, what kind of job could they ever get? How could you go about daily life? If you don't know math, how do you budget? Or know what something will cost if it is 20% off? These are skills that we are able to use without even thinking about them. This is because we have started learning these skills since before we even went to school!

I know many kids in school think they will never use math once they are out of school, but they use it when they do not even realize it. If a child does not learn how to read or write, how would they function. Think about cell phones now. We read texts on them every day. We write texts on them every day. These are skills that are needed in this day and age. 
I know that there are many other things that students should learn in school, but these are the most important.
 On top of these skills they should be taught basic life skills. Skills such as writing a check, applying for a mortgage, doing their taxes. But none of this could be done if they had not already allowed been taught reading, writing and arithmetic!
I know that I have learned many things in school that I will never use in my life.
 But I use reading, writing and math every single day. I think these subjects are the basis of all other subjects. You could not even learn other subjects  without being able to read or write.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the three Rs: Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. I know this sounds kind of old school, and I do believe there are many other things students should be taught that they aren't, but honestly, we do need this in our everyday life! Where would we be if we could not read or write? And basic arithmetic is used everyday! I know I use it everyday!

If a student does not learn how to read or write, what kind of job could they ever get? How could you go about daily life? If you don't know math, how do you budget? Or know what something will cost if it is 20% off? These are skills that we are able to use without even thinking about them. This is because we have started learning these skills since before we even went to school!

I know many kids in school think they will never use math once they are out of school, but they use it when they do not even realize it. If a child does not learn how to read or write, how would they function. Think about cell phones now. We read texts on them every day. We write texts on them every day. These are skills that are needed in this day and age. 
I know that there are many other things that students should learn in school, but these are the most important.
 On top of these skills they should be taught basic life skills. Skills such as writing a check, applying for a mortgage, doing their taxes. But none of this could be done if they had not already allowed been taught reading, writing and arithmetic!
I know that I have learned many things in school that I will never use in my life.
 But I use reading, writing and math every single day. I think these subjects are the basis of all other subjects. You could not even learn other subjects  without being able to read or write.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the three Rs: Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. I know this sounds kind of old school, and I do believe there are many other things students should be taught that they aren't, but honestly, we do need this in our everyday life! Where would we be if we could not read or write? And basic arithmetic is used everyday! I know I use it everyday!

If a student does not learn how to read or write, what kind of job could they ever get? How could you go about daily life? If you don't know math, how do you budget? Or know what something will cost if it is 20% off? These are skills that we are able to use without even thinking about them. This is because we have started learning these skills since before we even went to school!

I know many kids in school think they will never use math once they are out of school, but they use it when they do not even realize it. If a child does not learn how to read or write, how would they function. Think about cell phones now. We read texts on them every day. We write texts on them every day. These are skills that are needed in this day and age. 
I know that there are many other things that students should learn in school, but these are the most important.
 On top of these skills they should be taught basic life skills. Skills such as writing a check, applying for a mortgage, doing their taxes. But none of this could be done if they had not already allowed been taught reading, writing and arithmetic!

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the three Rs: Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. I know this sounds kind of old school, and I do believe there are many other things students should be taught that they aren't, but honestly, we do need this in our everyday life! Where would we be if we could not read or write? And basic arithmetic is used everyday! I know I use it everyday!

If a student does not learn how to read or write, what kind of job could they ever get? How could you go about daily life? If you don't know math, how do you budget? Or know what something will cost if it is 20% off? These are skills that we are able to use without even thinking about them. This is because we have started learning these skills since before we even went to school!

I know many kids in school think they will never use math once they are out of school, but they use it when they do not even realize it. If a child does not learn how to read or write, how would they function. Think about cell phones now. We read texts on them every day. We write texts on them every day.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the three Rs: Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. I know this sounds kind of old school, and I do believe there are many other things students should be taught that they aren't, but honestly, we do need this in our everyday life! Where would we be if we could not read or write? And basic arithmetic is used everyday! I know I use it everyday!

If a student does not learn how to read or write, what kind of job could they ever get? How could you go about daily life? If you don't know math, how do you budget? Or know what something will cost if it is 20% off? These are skills that we are able to use without even thinking about them. This is because we have started learning these skills since before we even went to school!

I know many kids in school think they will never use math once they are out of school, but they use it when they do not even realize it. If a child does not learn how to read or write, how would they function. Think about cell phones now. We read texts on them every day. We write texts on them every day. These are skills that are needed in this day and age. 
I know that there are many other things that students should learn in school, but these are the most important.
 On top of these skills they should be taught basic life skills. Skills such as writing a check, applying for a mortgage, doing their taxes. But none of this could be done if they had not already allowed been taught reading, writing and arithmetic!
I know that I have learned many things in school that I will never use in my life.
 But I use reading, writing and math every single day. I think these subjects are the basis of all other subjects. You could not even learn other subjects  without being able to read or write.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the three Rs: Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. I know this sounds kind of old school, and I do believe there are many other things students should be taught that they aren't, but honestly, we do need this in our everyday life! Where would we be if we could not read or write? And basic arithmetic is used everyday! I know I use it everyday!

If a student does not learn how to read or write, what kind of job could they ever get? How could you go about daily life? If you don't know math, how do you budget? Or know what something will cost if it is 20% off? These are skills that we are able to use without even thinking about them. This is because we have started learning these skills since before we even went to school!

I know many kids in school think they will never use math once they are out of school, but they use it when they do not even realize it. If a child does not learn how to read or write, how would they function. Think about cell phones now. We read texts on them every day. We write texts on them every day. These are skills that are needed in this day and age. 
I know that there are many other things that students should learn in school, but these are the most important.
 On top of these skills they should be taught basic life skills. Skills such as writing a check, applying for a mortgage, doing their taxes. But none of this could be done if they had not already allowed been taught reading, writing and arithmetic!
I know that I have learned many things in school that I will never use in my life.
 But I use reading, writing and math every single day. I think these subjects are the basis of all other subjects. You could not even learn other subjects  without being able to read or write.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the three Rs: Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. I know this sounds kind of old school, and I do believe there are many other things students should be taught that they aren't, but honestly, we do need this in our everyday life! Where would we be if we could not read or write? And basic arithmetic is used everyday! I know I use it everyday!

If a student does not learn how to read or write, what kind of job could they ever get? How could you go about daily life? If you don't know math, how do you budget? Or know what something will cost if it is 20% off? These are skills that we are able to use without even thinking about them. This is because we have started learning these skills since before we even went to school!

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the three Rs: Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. I know this sounds kind of old school, and I do believe there are many other things students should be taught that they aren't, but honestly, we do need this in our everyday life! Where would we be if we could not read or write? And basic arithmetic is used everyday! I know I use it everyday!

If a student does not learn how to read or write, what kind of job could they ever get? How could you go about daily life? If you don't know math, how do you budget? Or know what something will cost if it is 20% off? These are skills that we are able to use without even thinking about them. This is because we have started learning these skills since before we even went to school!

I know many kids in school think they will never use math once they are out of school, but they use it when they do not even realize it. If a child does not learn how to read or write, how would they function. Think about cell phones now. We read texts on them every day. We write texts on them every day. These are skills that are needed in this day and age. 
I know that there are many other things that students should learn in school, but these are the most important.
 On top of these skills they should be taught basic life skills. Skills such as writing a check, applying for a mortgage, doing their taxes. But none of this could be done if they had not already allowed been taught reading, writing and arithmetic!
I know that I have learned many things in school that I will never use in my life.
 But I use reading, writing and math every single day. I think these subjects are the basis of all other subjects. You could not even learn other subjects  without being able to read or write.

Where would we be if we could not read or write? And basic arithmetic is used everyday! I know I use it everyday!

If a student does not learn how to read or write, what kind of job could they ever get? How could you go about daily life? If you don't know math, how do you budget? Or know what something will cost if it is 20% off? These are skills that we are able to use without even thinking about them. This is because we have started learning these skills since before we even went to school!

I know many kids in school think they will never use math once they are out of school, but they use it when they do not even realize it. If a child does not learn how to read or write, how would they function. Think about cell phones now. We read texts on them every day. We write texts on them every day. These are skills that are needed in this day and age. 
I know that there are many other things that students should learn in school, but these are the most important.
 On top of these skills they should be taught basic life skills. Skills such as writing a check, applying for a mortgage, doing their taxes. But none of this could be done if they had not already allowed been taught reading, writing and arithmetic!
I know that I have learned many things in school that I will never use in my life.
 But I use reading, writing and math every single day. I think these subjects are the basis of all other subjects. You could not even learn other subjects  without being able to read or write. 

I think the school curriculum does need to be reevaluated. But the one thing that should never change is the core subjects of reading, writing and arithmetic. These are definitely the most important classes students should be taught an",user,33,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the three Rs: Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. I know this sounds kind of old school, and I do believe there are many other things students should be taught that they aren't, but honestly, we do need this in our everyday life! Where would we be if we could not read or write? And basic arithmetic is used everyday! I know I use it everyday!

If a student does not learn how to read or write, what kind of job could they ever get? How could you go about daily life? If you don't know math, how do you budget? Or know what something will cost if it is 20% off? These are skills that we are able to use without even thinking about them. This is because we have started learning these skills since before we even went to school!

I know many kids in school think they will never use math once they are out of school, but they use it when they do not even realize it. If a child does not learn how to read or write, how would they function. Think about cell phones now. We read texts on them every day. We write texts on them every day. These are skills that are needed in this day and age.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the three Rs: Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. I know this sounds kind of old school, and I do believe there are many other things students should be taught that they aren't, but honestly, we do need this in our everyday life! Where would we be if we could not read or write? And basic arithmetic is used everyday! I know I use it everyday!

If a student does not learn how to read or write, what kind of job could they ever get? How could you go about daily life? If you don't know math, how do you budget? Or know what something will cost if it is 20% off? These are skills that we are able to use without even thinking about them. This is because we have started learning these skills since before we even went to school!

I know many kids in school think they will never use math once they are out of school, but they use it when they do not even realize it. If a child does not learn how to read or write, how would they function. Think about cell phones now. We read texts on them every day. We write texts on them every day.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the three Rs: Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. I know this sounds kind of old school, and I do believe there are many other things students should be taught that they aren't, but honestly, we do need this in our everyday life! Where would we be if we could not read or write? And basic arithmetic is used everyday! I know I use it everyday!

If a student does not learn how to read or write, what kind of job could they ever get? How could you go about daily life? If you don't know math, how do you budget? Or know what something will cost if it is 20% off? These are skills that we are able to use without even thinking about them. This is because we have started learning these skills since before we even went to school!

I know many kids in school think they will never use math once they are out of school, but they use it when they do not even realize it. If a child does not learn how to read or write, how would they function. Think about cell phones now. We read texts on them every day. We write texts on them every day.
