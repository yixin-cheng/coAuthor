I would not want to watch or read about all older people being fools, lacking technical skills and being a drain on public funds.  I suppose this is because I am one of those older people and none of that is true of me and pretty much every older person I know.  Ageism is a bad thing. 

All stereotypes encourage discrimination that people justify on the the basis of the stereotype.  It can actually encourage violence and persecution of groups of people.  Look at what happened all over Europe under Hitler and his like-minded allies.   

I think that the only way to combat stereotypes is to show that they are not true.  The best way to do that is figure out what stereotype fits the profile of the person spouting off and turn it against him and use it against him.  I guarantee it will fire him up and he'll be denying most if not all about what you are pronouncing as the truth about him.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, all stereotypes are bad.  Even the ones that hold little girls are all sweetness and light are negative in that they deny little girls the right to be normal human beings.

I would not want to watch or read about all older people being fools, lacking technical skills and being a drain on public funds.  I suppose this is because I am one of those older people and none of that is true of me and pretty much every older person I know.  Ageism is a bad thing. 

All stereotypes encourage discrimination that people justify on the the basis of the stereotype.  It can actually encourage violence and persecution of groups of people.  Look at what happened all over Europe under Hitler and his like-minded allies.   

I think that the only way to combat stereotypes is to show that they are not true.  The best way to do that is figure out what stereotype fits the profile of the person spouting off and turn it against him and use it against him.

I would not want to watch or read about all older people being fools, lacking technical skills and being a drain on public funds.  I suppose this is because I am one of those older people and none of that is true of me and pretty much every older person I know.  Ageism is a bad thing.

In my opinion, all stereotypes are bad.  Even the ones that hold little girls are all sweetness and light are negative in that they deny little girls the right to be normal human beings.

I would not want to watch or read about all older people being fools, lacking technical skills and being a drain on public funds.  I suppose this is because I am one of those older people and none of that is true of me and pretty much every older person I know.  Ageism is a bad thing. 

All stereotypes encourage discrimination that people justify on the the basis of the stereotype.  It can actually encourage violence and persecution of groups of people.  Look at what happened all over Europe under Hitler and his like-minded allies.   

I think that the only way to combat stereotypes is to show that they are not true.  The best way to do that is figure out what stereotype fits the profile of the person spouting off and turn it against him and use it against him.  I guarantee it will fire him up and he'll be denying most if not all about what you are pronouncing as the truth about him.  It can be based on gender, age, looks, skin color, religion, political stance, size of his feet, hands, nose, head, his height, or lack thereof, educational level, income level, clubs, favorite food and drink, anything at all.  It's not hard to figure out one that will fit or even a combination that will.

I would not want to watch or read about all older people being fools, lacking technical skills and being a drain on public funds.  I suppose this is because I am one of those older people and none of that is true of me and pretty much every older person I know.  Ageism is a bad thing.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, all stereotypes are bad.  Even the ones that hold little girls are all sweetness and light are negative in that they deny little girls the right to be normal human beings.

I would not want to watch or read about all older people being fools, lacking technical skills and being a drain on public funds.  I suppose this is because I am one of those older people and none of that is true of me and pretty much every older person I know.  Ageism is a bad thing. 

All stereotypes encourage discrimination that people justify on the the basis of the stereotype.  It can actually encourage violence and persecution of groups of people.  Look at what happened all over Europe under Hitler and his like-minded allies.   

I think that the only way to combat stereotypes is to show that they are not true.  The best way to do that is figure out what stereotype fits the profile of the person spouting off and turn it against him and use it against him.  I guarantee it will fire him up and he'll be denying most if not all about what you are pronouncing as the truth about him.  It can be based on gender, age, looks, skin color, religion, political stance, size of his feet, hands, nose, head, his height, or lack thereof, educational level, income level, clubs, favorite food and drink, anything at all.  It's not hard to figure out one that will fit or even a combination that will.

I would not want to watch or read about all older people being fools, lacking technical skills and being a drain on public funds.  I suppose this is because I am one of those older people and none of that is true of me and pretty much every older person I know.  Ageism is a bad thing. 

All stereotypes encourage discrimination that people justify on the the basis of the stereotype.  It can actually encourage violence and persecution of groups of people.  Look at what happened all over Europe under Hitler and his like-minded allies.   

I think that the only way to combat stereotypes is to show that they are not true.  The best way to do that is figure out what stereotype fits the profile of the person spouting off and turn it against him and use it against him.  I guarantee it will fire him up and he'll be denying most if not all about what you are pronouncing as the truth about him.  It can be based on gender, age, looks, skin color, religion, political stance, size of his feet, hands, nose, head, his height, or lack thereof, educational level, income level, clubs, favorite food and drink, anything at all.  It's not hard to figure out one that will fit or even a combination that will.

In my opinion, all stereotypes are bad.  Even the ones that hold little girls are all sweetness and light are negative in that they deny little girls the right to be normal human beings.

I would not want to watch or read about all older people being fools, lacking technical skills and being a drain on public funds.  I suppose this is because I am one of those older people and none of that is true of me and pretty much every older person I know.  Ageism is a bad thing. 

All stereotypes encourage discrimination that people justify on the the basis of the stereotype.  It can actually encourage violence and persecution of groups of people.  Look at what happened all over Europe under Hitler and his like-minded allies.   

I think that the only way to combat stereotypes is to show that they are not true.  The best way to do that is figure out what stereotype fits the profile of the person spouting off and turn it against him and use it against him.  I guarantee it will fire him up and he'll be denying most if not all about what you are pronouncing as the truth about him.  It can be based on gender, age, looks, skin color, religion, political stance, size of his feet, hands, nose, head, his height, or lack thereof, educational level, income level, clubs, favorite food and drink, anything at all.

I would not want to watch or read about all older people being fools, lacking technical skills and being a drain on public funds.  I suppose this is because I am one of those older people and none of that is true of me and pretty much every older person I know.  Ageism is a bad thing.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, all stereotypes are bad.  Even the ones that hold little girls are all sweetness and light are negative in that they deny little girls the right to be normal human beings.

I would not want to watch or read about all older people being fools, lacking technical skills and being a drain on public funds.  I suppose this is because I am one of those older people and none of that is true of me and pretty much every older person I know.  Ageism is a bad thing. 

All stereotypes encourage discrimination that people justify on the the basis of the stereotype.  It can actually encourage violence and persecution of groups of people.  Look at what happened all over Europe under Hitler and his like-minded allies.   

I think that the only way to combat stereotypes is to show that they are not true.  The best way to do that is figure out what stereotype fits the profile of the person spouting off and turn it against him and use it against him.  I guarantee it will fire him up and he'll be denying most if not all about what you are pronouncing as the truth about him.  It can be based on gender, age, looks, skin color, religion, political stance, size of his feet, hands, nose, head, his height, or lack thereof, educational level, income level, clubs, favorite food and drink, anything at all.  It's not hard to figure out one that will fit or even a combination that will. 

Hopefully, after that exercise the perpetrator will come to his senses and engage in some reflection that will will improve him as a human being.  No guarantee, but

I would not want to watch or read about all older people being fools, lacking technical skills and being a drain on public funds.  I suppose this is because I am one of those older people and none of that is true of me and pretty much every older person I know.  Ageism is a bad thing. 

All stereotypes encourage discrimination that people justify on the the basis of the stereotype.  It can actually encourage violence and persecution of groups of people.  Look at what happened all over Europe under Hitler and his like-minded allies.   

I think that the only way to combat stereotypes is to show that they are not true.  The best way to do that is figure out what stereotype fits the profile of the person spouting off and turn it against him and use it against him.  I guarantee it will fire him up and he'll be denying most if not all about what you are pronouncing as the truth about him.  It can be based on gender, age, looks, skin color, religion, political stance, size of his feet, hands, nose, head, his height, or lack thereof, educational level, income level, clubs, favorite food and drink, anything at all.  It's not hard to figure out one that will fit or even a combination that will. 

Hopefully, after that exercise the perpetrator will come to his senses and engage in some reflection that will will improve him as a human being.  No guarantee, but I'd say there
