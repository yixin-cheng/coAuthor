Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, Schools should not provide period products. This is the responsibility of the parents. Budgeting for products like pads and tampons is different from budgeting for toilet paper, soap and other products. Pad and tampons are products related to the reproductive cycle. They are tied to things such as puberty and fertility. That makes them a sensitive issue, especially among students.  
I believe that parents should supply students with period products.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, Schools should not provide period products. This is the responsibility of the parents. Budgeting for products like pads and tampons is different from budgeting for toilet paper, soap and other products. Pad and tampons are products related to the reproductive cycle. They are tied to things such as puberty and fertility. That makes them a sensitive issue, especially among students.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, Schools should not provide period products. This is the responsibility of the parents. Budgeting for products like pads and tampons is different from budgeting for toilet paper, soap and other products. Pad and tampons are products related to the reproductive cycle. They are tied to things such as puberty and fertility. That makes them a sensitive issue, especially among students.  
I believe that parents should supply students with period products.
 Parents don't want schools to teach their children about morality and controversial reproductive issues, therefore, they need to provide the products they want for their children.  Tampons are like deodorant. If you teach your kid that the aluminum in deodorant is causing health issues,  you should provide the product that you want your kids to use, yourself. 

eriod products are not expensive for women and it is a personal issue.
   As a product some people may also be sensitive to it. Some people may need custom products because of allergies. Once schools open the door to being the provider of these products, they also become responsible for custom items. 

Parents are the ultimate guardians of their children, and should be teaching their children about the fundamentals of their reproductive cycle.   Schools should not have to be held responsible for a product that is so sensitive. I believe this is an issue solely for parents and their children.  Schools",user,24,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

 Parents don't want schools to teach their children about morality and controversial reproductive issues, therefore, they need to provide the products they want for their children.  Tampons are like deodorant. If you teach your kid that the aluminum in deodorant is causing health issues,  you should provide the product that you want your kids to use, yourself. 

eriod products are not expensive for women and it is a personal issue.
   As a product some people may also be sensitive to it. Some people may need custom products because of allergies. Once schools open the door to being the provider of these products, they also become responsible for custom items. 

Parents are the ultimate guardians of their children, and should be teaching their children about the fundamentals of their reproductive cycle.   Schools should not have to be held responsible for a product that is so sensitive. I believe this is an issue solely for parents and their children.  Schools should focus on learning, with perhaps a small supply of products for emergencies only.",user,24,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
