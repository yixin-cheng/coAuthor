The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we need to just get over it. It's a new world since the pandemic hit. We no longer can go freely in the world without having to worry about our health and the health of others. We now watch movies of things we may have ordinarily done in reality only a year ago. 
What, for example, are the benefits of screens over reality?
 We miss the in person connection to other people. However, we open the door to and endless world of possibilities. By having more screen time, we're all discovering new ways to use such technology. Maybe you discovered a new online video game such as Fallout 76. You now get to go and visit West Virginia in the game and meet other players you never would have met before. That's a really fun experience you may never have had if not for the increase of using such devices.

here are also health benefits to using screen time.
 During the pandemic, alcohol use and other unhealthy habits became more popular. It was a way for people to cope with what is happening, especially during lockdown. Screen time can help to distract people from such unhealthy habits and addictions. It gives them something else to do to occupy their time. If you think of it in that way, it does have health benefits.
It helps that we have a 24 hour news cycle on television.
 That is a positive side of screen time as well. What we're watching doesn't have to be mindless. It can consist of learning about things and expanding our minds. And just seeing what is happening elsewhere in the world can help with the feelings of loneliness many of us have been feeling.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we need to just get over it. It's a new world since the pandemic hit. We no longer can go freely in the world without having to worry about our health and the health of others. We now watch movies of things we may have ordinarily done in reality only a year ago. 
What, for example, are the benefits of screens over reality?
 We miss the in person connection to other people. However, we open the door to and endless world of possibilities. By having more screen time, we're all discovering new ways to use such technology. Maybe you discovered a new online video game such as Fallout 76. You now get to go and visit West Virginia in the game and meet other players you never would have met before. That's a really fun experience you may never have had if not for the increase of using such devices.

here are also health benefits to using screen time.
 During the pandemic, alcohol use and other unhealthy habits became more popular. It was a way for people to cope with what is happening, especially during lockdown. Screen time can help to distract people from such unhealthy habits and addictions. It gives them something else to do to occupy their time. If you think of it in that way, it does have health benefits.
It helps that we have a 24 hour news cycle on television.
 That is a positive side of screen time as well. What we're watching doesn't have to be mindless. It can consist of learning about things and expanding our minds. And just seeing what is happening elsewhere in the world can help with the feelings of loneliness many of us have been feeling.

If you look at all of the benefits of screen time, they outweigh the negatives. Maybe in the future we can be worried about it. This is not the time, though. Right now we need to embrace anything we have that can bring positivity into our lives at this",user,30,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
