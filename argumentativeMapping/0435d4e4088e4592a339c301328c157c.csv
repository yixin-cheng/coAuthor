It also allows you more time to hear the story especially when driving. Imagine going on a cross country trip and bringing audiobooks with you. You could easily get through multiple books even while driving. If you had brought regular books then you might have been lucky to get through one in your downtime. 
There are disadvantages to listening to an audiobook.
 You don't get that connection that you otherwise would have had from holding the physical book. Also out of sight out of mind comes into play as well. If you don't see a physical book sitting on your coffee table then it can be easy to forget that you were even reading in the first place. That's part of living a hectic life. 

It's gotten so easy to access audiobooks that they are just as available as physical books now. You can even download them for free via your library's app. No longer do you need to pay for an audiobook. That is a game changer. 

So which is the right choice, an audio book or a regular book? I think that depends on what your situation is and why you are reading. If you are busy and and otherwise wouldn't have time to read then an audiobook is a great choice. If you however have more free time then you can't beat a regular book. The most important thing though is to just keep taking in these stories that are available to us. The way they are delivered isn't as important as just doing it.",user,30,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
