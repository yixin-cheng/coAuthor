In my opinion, screens are a clear and present danger in our lives. Despite this, screen use remains a necessary component of daily life. Because of this, we must remain more vigilant now than ever before about the potential negative impacts that it has on our daily lives. 

During the pandemic, the excessive screen use is resulting in lasting harm to health of our vision. This increase in usage often the result of sharp increases rather than a slow transition and is therefore more detrimental in the impact it has on our vision. Blue light has been linked to decreased retinal activity and has shown a statistically significant increase of early onset blindness in senior citizens who have reported more than 10 hours of screen time each day. 

Physical dangers aside, there is also a concern about the content that is behind the screen. We live in a time when truth and lies are blended together for our online consumption. This sharing of misinformation during a time when it is most important to have the best information possible has been extremely damaging to society’s trust in our institutions. Any benefits gained are far outweighed by the risk to our relationships and to the stability of our society.
