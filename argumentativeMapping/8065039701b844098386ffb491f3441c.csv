In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I would not say we are bad citizens for keeping up with the news. I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving. Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I would not say we are bad citizens for keeping up with the news. I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving. Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I would not say we are bad citizens for keeping up with the news. I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice.

In my opinion, I would not say we are bad citizens for keeping up with the news. I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving. Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I would not say we are bad citizens for keeping up with the news. I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving. Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

In my opinion, I would not say we are bad citizens for keeping up with the news. I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I would not say we are bad citizens for keeping up with the news. I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving. Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I would not say we are bad citizens for keeping up with the news. I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving. Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

What if we are not news conscience, and we take a trip abroad to a foreign country, and missed a US travel advisory saying that there is a high risk of being kidnapped in that country, or even a high risk of catching a disease that is really contagious and spreading fast in that country.

In my opinion, I would not say we are bad citizens for keeping up with the news. I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving.

In my opinion, I would not say we are bad citizens for keeping up with the news. I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving. Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving. Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving. Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I would not say we are bad citizens for keeping up with the news. I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving. Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving. Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I would not say we are bad citizens for keeping up with the news. I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving. Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I would not say we are bad citizens for keeping up with the news. I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving. Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

What if we are not news conscience, and we take a trip abroad to a foreign country, and missed a US travel advisory saying that there is a high risk of being kidnapped in that country, or even a high risk of catching a disease that is really contagious and spreading fast in that country.

For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving.

I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving. Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

What if we are not news conscience, and we take a trip abroad to a foreign country, and missed a US travel advisory saying that there is a high risk of being kidnapped in that country, or even a high risk of catching a disease that is really contagious and spreading fast in that country. Then we are seriously putting ourselves, and maybe our family at a high risk of serious complications. What would people do, because they were unaware of what was going on in the world around them.  
I think that we are responsible for keeping up with the news, because it is our responsibility to be informed about what is going on iaround us, at least for most of the time.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I would not say we are bad citizens for keeping up with the news. I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving. Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

What if we are not news conscience, and we take a trip abroad to a foreign country, and missed a US travel advisory saying that there is a high risk of being kidnapped in that country, or even a high risk of catching a disease that is really contagious and spreading fast in that country. Then we are seriously putting ourselves, and maybe our family at a high risk of serious complications. What would people do, because they were unaware of what was going on in the world around them.  
I think that we are responsible for keeping up with the news, because it is our responsibility to be informed about what is going on iaround us, at least for most of the time.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I would not say we are bad citizens for keeping up with the news. I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving.

That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving. Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

What if we are not news conscience, and we take a trip abroad to a foreign country, and missed a US travel advisory saying that there is a high risk of being kidnapped in that country, or even a high risk of catching a disease that is really contagious and spreading fast in that country. Then we are seriously putting ourselves, and maybe our family at a high risk of serious complications. What would people do, because they were unaware of what was going on in the world around them.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I would not say we are bad citizens for keeping up with the news. I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving. Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

What if we are not news conscience, and we take a trip abroad to a foreign country, and missed a US travel advisory saying that there is a high risk of being kidnapped in that country, or even a high risk of catching a disease that is really contagious and spreading fast in that country. Then we are seriously putting ourselves, and maybe our family at a high risk of serious complications. What would people do, because they were unaware of what was going on in the world around them.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice.

Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I would not say we are bad citizens for keeping up with the news. I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving.

Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving. Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

What if we are not news conscience, and we take a trip abroad to a foreign country, and missed a US travel advisory saying that there is a high risk of being kidnapped in that country, or even a high risk of catching a disease that is really contagious and spreading fast in that country. Then we are seriously putting ourselves, and maybe our family at a high risk of serious complications. What would people do, because they were unaware of what was going on in the world around them.  
I think that we are responsible for keeping up with the news, because it is our responsibility to be informed about what is going on iaround us, at least for most of the time.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I would not say we are bad citizens for keeping up with the news. I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving. Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

What if we are not news conscience, and we take a trip abroad to a foreign country, and missed a US travel advisory saying that there is a high risk of being kidnapped in that country, or even a high risk of catching a disease that is really contagious and spreading fast in that country. Then we are seriously putting ourselves, and maybe our family at a high risk of serious complications. What would people do, because they were unaware of what was going on in the world around them.  
I think that we are responsible for keeping up with the news, because it is our responsibility to be informed about what is going on iaround us, at least for most of the time.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I would not say we are bad citizens for keeping up with the news. I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving. Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

What if we are not news conscience, and we take a trip abroad to a foreign country, and missed a US travel advisory saying that there is a high risk of being kidnapped in that country, or even a high risk of catching a disease that is really contagious and spreading fast in that country. Then we are seriously putting ourselves, and maybe our family at a high risk of serious complications. What would people do, because they were unaware of what was going on in the world around them.  
I think that we are responsible for keeping up with the news, because it is our responsibility to be informed about what is going on iaround us, at least for most of the time. As a matter of fact, I read a news article just the other day about some serious Joker virus that was infecting Android smartphone applications. It drains people's bank accounts.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, I would not say we are bad citizens for keeping up with the news. I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving. Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

In my opinion, I would not say we are bad citizens for keeping up with the news. I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving. Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

What if we are not news conscience, and we take a trip abroad to a foreign country, and missed a US travel advisory saying that there is a high risk of being kidnapped in that country, or even a high risk of catching a disease that is really contagious and spreading fast in that country. Then we are seriously putting ourselves, and maybe our family at a high risk of serious complications. What would people do, because they were unaware of what was going on in the world around them.  
I think that we are responsible for keeping up with the news, because it is our responsibility to be informed about what is going on iaround us, at least for most of the time. As a matter of fact, I read a news article just the other day about some serious Joker virus that was infecting Android smartphone applications. It drains people's bank accounts. If I didn't read the news about, I would not have known that my wife had one of those apps on her phone, and we would have been clueless about where our money went.
