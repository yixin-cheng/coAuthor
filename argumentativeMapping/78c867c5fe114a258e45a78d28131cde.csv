Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals have different defenses than humans, and they are not as capable of defending themselves. The chances that the animal brought the abuse on themselves are impossible. Humans are more capable of defending themselves, and they have a choice on whether or not to do something. And in the case of humans, they have the ability to speak up for themselves. I think any empathetic person would defend any living being that is suffering abuse, whether human or animal.

The chances that the animal brought the abuse on themselves are impossible. Humans are more capable of defending themselves, and they have a choice on whether or not to do something. And in the case of humans, they have the ability to speak up for themselves. I think any empathetic person would defend any living being that is suffering abuse, whether human or animal.  In some cases, it could be assumed that the human did something to bring the injury on themselves in cases such as revenge.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals have different defenses than humans, and they are not as capable of defending themselves. The chances that the animal brought the abuse on themselves are impossible. Humans are more capable of defending themselves, and they have a choice on whether or not to do something. And in the case of humans, they have the ability to speak up for themselves. I think any empathetic person would defend any living being that is suffering abuse, whether human or animal.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals have different defenses than humans, and they are not as capable of defending themselves. The chances that the animal brought the abuse on themselves are impossible. Humans are more capable of defending themselves, and they have a choice on whether or not to do something. And in the case of humans, they have the ability to speak up for themselves. I think any empathetic person would defend any living being that is suffering abuse, whether human or animal.  In some cases, it could be assumed that the human did something to bring the injury on themselves in cases such as revenge.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals have different defenses than humans, and they are not as capable of defending themselves. The chances that the animal brought the abuse on themselves are impossible. Humans are more capable of defending themselves, and they have a choice on whether or not to do something. And in the case of humans, they have the ability to speak up for themselves. I think any empathetic person would defend any living being that is suffering abuse, whether human or animal.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals have different defenses than humans, and they are not as capable of defending themselves. The chances that the animal brought the abuse on themselves are impossible. Humans are more capable of defending themselves, and they have a choice on whether or not to do something. And in the case of humans, they have the ability to speak up for themselves. I think any empathetic person would defend any living being that is suffering abuse, whether human or animal.  In some cases, it could be assumed that the human did something to bring the injury on themselves in cases such as revenge. However, many times humans are attacked by other people, they are defenseless and helpless. I think the focus should be on the assailant.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals have different defenses than humans, and they are not as capable of defending themselves. The chances that the animal brought the abuse on themselves are impossible. Humans are more capable of defending themselves, and they have a choice on whether or not to do something. And in the case of humans, they have the ability to speak up for themselves. I think any empathetic person would defend any living being that is suffering abuse, whether human or animal.  In some cases, it could be assumed that the human did something to bring the injury on themselves in cases such as revenge. However, many times humans are attacked by other people, they are defenseless and helpless. I think the focus should be on the assailant.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals have different defenses than humans, and they are not as capable of defending themselves. The chances that the animal brought the abuse on themselves are impossible. Humans are more capable of defending themselves, and they have a choice on whether or not to do something. And in the case of humans, they have the ability to speak up for themselves. I think any empathetic person would defend any living being that is suffering abuse, whether human or animal.  In some cases, it could be assumed that the human did something to bring the injury on themselves in cases such as revenge. However, many times humans are attacked by other people, they are defenseless and helpless. I think the focus should be on the assailant.  Anyone that harms an animal needs help , and I think that they should be punished. There could be some debate about sentences for animal crimes versus human crimes.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals have different defenses than humans, and they are not as capable of defending themselves. The chances that the animal brought the abuse on themselves are impossible. Humans are more capable of defending themselves, and they have a choice on whether or not to do something. And in the case of humans, they have the ability to speak up for themselves. I think any empathetic person would defend any living being that is suffering abuse, whether human or animal.  In some cases, it could be assumed that the human did something to bring the injury on themselves in cases such as revenge. However, many times humans are attacked by other people, they are defenseless and helpless. I think the focus should be on the assailant.  Anyone that harms an animal needs help , and I think that they should be punished. There could be some debate about sentences for animal crimes versus human crimes.   However, I think that the focus should be on the person that committed the crime and their motivations for their actions. ",user,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
