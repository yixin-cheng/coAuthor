That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.

That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.

That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world.

One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.

One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.

That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.

The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.
I think engaging with current events is important.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around.

 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad.

The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around.

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.
I think engaging with current events is important.
 Even if it isn't something as important as politics or the pandemic, it's still your duty as a citizen.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.
I think engaging with current events is important.
 Even if it isn't something as important as politics or the pandemic, it's still your duty as a citizen. What if you had children and by not watching the news you missed hearing about a carnival in a neighboring town? Your family missed out on a chance to go do something fun and memorable.

That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.
I think engaging with current events is important.
 Even if it isn't something as important as politics or the pandemic, it's still your duty as a citizen. What if you had children and by not watching the news you missed hearing about a carnival in a neighboring town? Your family missed out on a chance to go do something fun and memorable.

 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world.

They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.

The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.
I think engaging with current events is important.
 Even if it isn't something as important as politics or the pandemic, it's still your duty as a citizen. What if you had children and by not watching the news you missed hearing about a carnival in a neighboring town? Your family missed out on a chance to go do something fun and memorable.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.

That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.
I think engaging with current events is important.
 Even if it isn't something as important as politics or the pandemic, it's still your duty as a citizen. What if you had children and by not watching the news you missed hearing about a carnival in a neighboring town? Your family missed out on a chance to go do something fun and memorable.

The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.

The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.
I think engaging with current events is important.
 Even if it isn't something as important as politics or the pandemic, it's still your duty as a citizen. What if you had children and by not watching the news you missed hearing about a carnival in a neighboring town? Your family missed out on a chance to go do something fun and memorable. 

There's different levels of importance when it comes to news. You don't have to keep up with celebrity news to be a citizen. However, you need to keep up with what is happening in the world. If that feels overwhelming, you at least nerd",user,28,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.

The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.
I think engaging with current events is important.
 Even if it isn't something as important as politics or the pandemic, it's still your duty as a citizen. What if you had children and by not watching the news you missed hearing about a carnival in a neighboring town? Your family missed out on a chance to go do something fun and memorable. 

There's different levels of importance when it comes to news. You don't have to keep up with celebrity news to be a citizen. However, you need to keep up with what is happening in the world.

I think engaging with current events is important.
 Even if it isn't something as important as politics or the pandemic, it's still your duty as a citizen. What if you had children and by not watching the news you missed hearing about a carnival in a neighboring town? Your family missed out on a chance to go do something fun and memorable. 

There's different levels of importance when it comes to news. You don't have to keep up with celebrity news to be a citizen. However, you need to keep up with what is happening in the world.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world.

There's different levels of importance when it comes to news. You don't have to keep up with celebrity news to be a citizen. However, you need to keep up with what is happening in the world.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.

There's different levels of importance when it comes to news. You don't have to keep up with celebrity news to be a citizen. However, you need to keep up with what is happening in the world.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.

 Even if it isn't something as important as politics or the pandemic, it's still your duty as a citizen. What if you had children and by not watching the news you missed hearing about a carnival in a neighboring town? Your family missed out on a chance to go do something fun and memorable. 

There's different levels of importance when it comes to news. You don't have to keep up with celebrity news to be a citizen. However, you need to keep up with what is happening in the world. If that feels overwhelming, you at least need to know what is happening in your very own country. That is the only way you can make informed decisions. Becaus",user,30,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.

However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.
I think engaging with current events is important.
 Even if it isn't something as important as politics or the pandemic, it's still your duty as a citizen. What if you had children and by not watching the news you missed hearing about a carnival in a neighboring town? Your family missed out on a chance to go do something fun and memorable. 

There's different levels of importance when it comes to news. You don't have to keep up with celebrity news to be a citizen. However, you need to keep up with what is happening in the world.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world.

In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.
I think engaging with current events is important.
 Even if it isn't something as important as politics or the pandemic, it's still your duty as a citizen. What if you had children and by not watching the news you missed hearing about a carnival in a neighboring town? Your family missed out on a chance to go do something fun and memorable. 

There's different levels of importance when it comes to news. You don't have to keep up with celebrity news to be a citizen. However, you need to keep up with what is happening in the world. If that feels overwhelming, you at least need to know what is happening in your very own country. That is the only way you can make informed decisions.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.
I think engaging with current events is important.
 Even if it isn't something as important as politics or the pandemic, it's still your duty as a citizen. What if you had children and by not watching the news you missed hearing about a carnival in a neighboring town? Your family missed out on a chance to go do something fun and memorable. 

There's different levels of importance when it comes to news. You don't have to keep up with celebrity news to be a citizen. However, you need to keep up with what is happening in the world. If that feels overwhelming, you at least need to know what is happening in your very own country. That is the only way you can make informed decisions.

 Even if it isn't something as important as politics or the pandemic, it's still your duty as a citizen. What if you had children and by not watching the news you missed hearing about a carnival in a neighboring town? Your family missed out on a chance to go do something fun and memorable. 

There's different levels of importance when it comes to news. You don't have to keep up with celebrity news to be a citizen. However, you need to keep up with what is happening in the world. If that feels overwhelming, you at least need to know what is happening in your very own country. That is the only way you can make informed decisions.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.

That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.
I think engaging with current events is important.
 Even if it isn't something as important as politics or the pandemic, it's still your duty as a citizen. What if you had children and by not watching the news you missed hearing about a carnival in a neighboring town? Your family missed out on a chance to go do something fun and memorable. 

There's different levels of importance when it comes to news. You don't have to keep up with celebrity news to be a citizen. However, you need to keep up with what is happening in the world. If that feels overwhelming, you at least need to know what is happening in your very own country. That is the only way you can make informed decisions.

There's different levels of importance when it comes to news. You don't have to keep up with celebrity news to be a citizen. However, you need to keep up with what is happening in the world. If that feels overwhelming, you at least need to know what is happening in your very own country. That is the only way you can make informed decisions.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.

The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.
I think engaging with current events is important.
 Even if it isn't something as important as politics or the pandemic, it's still your duty as a citizen. What if you had children and by not watching the news you missed hearing about a carnival in a neighboring town? Your family missed out on a chance to go do something fun and memorable. 

There's different levels of importance when it comes to news. You don't have to keep up with celebrity news to be a citizen. However, you need to keep up with what is happening in the world. If that feels overwhelming, you at least need to know what is happening in your very own country. That is the only way you can make informed decisions. Because otherwise you are just blindly making decisions that not only have the potential to harm yourself",user,30,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

 Even if it isn't something as important as politics or the pandemic, it's still your duty as a citizen. What if you had children and by not watching the news you missed hearing about a carnival in a neighboring town? Your family missed out on a chance to go do something fun and memorable. 

There's different levels of importance when it comes to news. You don't have to keep up with celebrity news to be a citizen. However, you need to keep up with what is happening in the world. If that feels overwhelming, you at least need to know what is happening in your very own country. That is the only way you can make informed decisions.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.
I think engaging with current events is important.
 Even if it isn't something as important as politics or the pandemic, it's still your duty as a citizen. What if you had children and by not watching the news you missed hearing about a carnival in a neighboring town? Your family missed out on a chance to go do something fun and memorable. 

There's different levels of importance when it comes to news. You don't have to keep up with celebrity news to be a citizen. However, you need to keep up with what is happening in the world. If that feels overwhelming, you at least need to know what is happening in your very own country. That is the only way you can make informed decisions. Because otherwise you are just blindly making decisions that not only have the potential to harm yourself but also your neig",user,30,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.
I think engaging with current events is important.
 Even if it isn't something as important as politics or the pandemic, it's still your duty as a citizen. What if you had children and by not watching the news you missed hearing about a carnival in a neighboring town? Your family missed out on a chance to go do something fun and memorable. 

There's different levels of importance when it comes to news. You don't have to keep up with celebrity news to be a citizen. However, you need to keep up with what is happening in the world. If that feels overwhelming, you at least need to know what is happening in your very own country. That is the only way you can make informed decisions. Because otherwise you are just blindly making decisions that not only have the potential to harm yourself but also your neighbors, friends a",user,30,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad.

 Even if it isn't something as important as politics or the pandemic, it's still your duty as a citizen. What if you had children and by not watching the news you missed hearing about a carnival in a neighboring town? Your family missed out on a chance to go do something fun and memorable.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
