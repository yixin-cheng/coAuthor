In my opinion, we should be worried about excessive screen use. The key word there is excessive. There is nothing wrong with using a laptop or a cell phone. The issue becomes when we rely too heavily on those devices. When instead of socializing with others and spending time with humans, we'd rather stay on our phone or laptop.

We had to rely on our screens during the pandemic. I think a lot of us would have went crazy without that because we couldn't really socialize with others. We couldn't go out. We had to stay inside and be as safe as possible. That means that our only way of entertainment was to watch television, use the internet, play video games, etc.

There is obvious value in screen time. We can get so much information from the internet nearly instantly. Screens can help us get from point A to point B via GPS.

The key to screen time just like everything else in life is balance. If we are using our screens too much it can have a negative effect on our social life as well as our physical health. Too much screen time can hurt our eyes.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should be worried about excessive screen use. The key word there is excessive. There is nothing wrong with using a laptop or a cell phone. The issue becomes when we rely too heavily on those devices. When instead of socializing with others and spending time with humans, we'd rather stay on our phone or laptop.

We had to rely on our screens during the pandemic. I think a lot of us would have went crazy without that because we couldn't really socialize with others. We couldn't go out. We had to stay inside and be as safe as possible. That means that our only way of entertainment was to watch television, use the internet, play video games, etc.

There is obvious value in screen time. We can get so much information from the internet nearly instantly. Screens can help us get from point A to point B via GPS.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we should be worried about excessive screen use. The key word there is excessive. There is nothing wrong with using a laptop or a cell phone. The issue becomes when we rely too heavily on those devices. When instead of socializing with others and spending time with humans, we'd rather stay on our phone or laptop.

We had to rely on our screens during the pandemic. I think a lot of us would have went crazy without that because we couldn't really socialize with others. We couldn't go out. We had to stay inside and be as safe as possible. That means that our only way of entertainment was to watch television, use the internet, play video games, etc.

There is obvious value in screen time. We can get so much information from the internet nearly instantly. Screens can help us get from point A to point B via GPS.

I don't think this is an all or nothing topic. We can use our screens and embrace technology while not relying on them 24 hours a day. There are already trackers on our phone that show us how often we use our phone. How often we pick the phone up. Our average screen time each week.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should be worried about excessive screen use. The key word there is excessive. There is nothing wrong with using a laptop or a cell phone. The issue becomes when we rely too heavily on those devices. When instead of socializing with others and spending time with humans, we'd rather stay on our phone or laptop.

We had to rely on our screens during the pandemic. I think a lot of us would have went crazy without that because we couldn't really socialize with others. We couldn't go out. We had to stay inside and be as safe as possible. That means that our only way of entertainment was to watch television, use the internet, play video games, etc.

There is obvious value in screen time. We can get so much information from the internet nearly instantly. Screens can help us get from point A to point B via GPS.

The key to screen time just like everything else in life is balance. If we are using our screens too much it can have a negative effect on our social life as well as our physical health. Too much screen time can hurt our eyes.

I don't think this is an all or nothing topic. We can use our screens and embrace technology while not relying on them 24 hours a day. There are already trackers on our phone that show us how often we use our phone. How often we pick the phone up. Our average screen time each week.

We can use those statistics to see if we're using our phones too much. If we are, it's pretty simple...have some willpower and cut down on screen time.
