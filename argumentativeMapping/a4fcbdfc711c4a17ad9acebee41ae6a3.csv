Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has definitely improved the dating scene. There's no more blind dates that go horribly wrong. You can now sit home and have a glass of wine while looking through profiles. It takes out a lot of the stress involved. It also makes it much easier to find a partner for certain kinks or fetishes. Not everyone is looking just for love.

In my opinion, technology has definitely improved the dating scene. There's no more blind dates that go horribly wrong. You can now sit home and have a glass of wine while looking through profiles. It takes out a lot of the stress involved. It also makes it much easier to find a partner for certain kinks or fetishes. Not everyone is looking just for love. Some people are looking for something very specific and you'd never be able to find that without using a website or an app. If you look at it that way, it's bringing people together who would otherwise never have met. 

As far as technology as a whole, it can be a mix of good and bad when it comes to dating. Once you are in a relationship then technology can start to drive you apart. People can become obsessed with their phone or other device to the point that you feel like your partner is ignoring you for the device. This ",user,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has definitely improved the dating scene. There's no more blind dates that go horribly wrong. You can now sit home and have a glass of wine while looking through profiles. It takes out a lot of the stress involved. It also makes it much easier to find a partner for certain kinks or fetishes. Not everyone is looking just for love. Some people are looking for something very specific and you'd never be able to find that without using a website or an app. If you look at it that way, it's bringing people together who would otherwise never have met. 

As far as technology as a whole, it can be a mix of good and bad when it comes to dating. Once you are in a relationship then technology can start to drive you apart. People can become obsessed with their phone or other device to the point that you feel like your partner is ignoring you for the device.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has definitely improved the dating scene. There's no more blind dates that go horribly wrong. You can now sit home and have a glass of wine while looking through profiles. It takes out a lot of the stress involved. It also makes it much easier to find a partner for certain kinks or fetishes. Not everyone is looking just for love. Some people are looking for something very specific and you'd never be able to find that without using a website or an app. If you look at it that way, it's bringing people together who would otherwise never have met. 

As far as technology as a whole, it can be a mix of good and bad when it comes to dating. Once you are in a relationship then technology can start to drive you apart. People can become obsessed with their phone or other device to the point that you feel like your partner is ignoring you for the device. This is an issue when people use technology to find love but then don't ever disconnect from it. People need to learn that there is too much of a good thing.

Some people are looking for something very specific and you'd never be able to find that without using a website or an app. If you look at it that way, it's bringing people together who would otherwise never have met. 

As far as technology as a whole, it can be a mix of good and bad when it comes to dating. Once you are in a relationship then technology can start to drive you apart. People can become obsessed with their phone or other device to the point that you feel like your partner is ignoring you for the device. This is an issue when people use technology to find love but then don't ever disconnect from it. People need to learn that there is too much of a good thing. Find what you need and then get out with technology. You already found love so what else is in your phone that is more important?

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has definitely improved the dating scene. There's no more blind dates that go horribly wrong. You can now sit home and have a glass of wine while looking through profiles. It takes out a lot of the stress involved. It also makes it much easier to find a partner for certain kinks or fetishes. Not everyone is looking just for love. Some people are looking for something very specific and you'd never be able to find that without using a website or an app. If you look at it that way, it's bringing people together who would otherwise never have met.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has definitely improved the dating scene. There's no more blind dates that go horribly wrong. You can now sit home and have a glass of wine while looking through profiles. It takes out a lot of the stress involved. It also makes it much easier to find a partner for certain kinks or fetishes. Not everyone is looking just for love. Some people are looking for something very specific and you'd never be able to find that without using a website or an app. If you look at it that way, it's bringing people together who would otherwise never have met. 

As far as technology as a whole, it can be a mix of good and bad when it comes to dating. Once you are in a relationship then technology can start to drive you apart. People can become obsessed with their phone or other device to the point that you feel like your partner is ignoring you for the device. This is an issue when people use technology to find love but then don't ever disconnect from it. People need to learn that there is too much of a good thing. Find what you need and then get out with technology. You already found love so what else is in your phone that is more important?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has definitely improved the dating scene. There's no more blind dates that go horribly wrong. You can now sit home and have a glass of wine while looking through profiles. It takes out a lot of the stress involved. It also makes it much easier to find a partner for certain kinks or fetishes. Not everyone is looking just for love. Some people are looking for something very specific and you'd never be able to find that without using a website or an app. If you look at it that way, it's bringing people together who would otherwise never have met. 

As far as technology as a whole, it can be a mix of good and bad when it comes to dating. Once you are in a relationship then technology can start to drive you apart. People can become obsessed with their phone or other device to the point that you feel like your partner is ignoring you for the device. This is an issue when people use technology to find love but then don't ever disconnect from it. People need to learn that there is too much of a good thing. Find what you need and then get out with technology. You already found love so what else is in your phone that is more important?

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has definitely improved the dating scene. There's no more blind dates that go horribly wrong. You can now sit home and have a glass of wine while looking through profiles. It takes out a lot of the stress involved. It also makes it much easier to find a partner for certain kinks or fetishes. Not everyone is looking just for love. Some people are looking for something very specific and you'd never be able to find that without using a website or an app. If you look at it that way, it's bringing people together who would otherwise never have met. 

As far as technology as a whole, it can be a mix of good and bad when it comes to dating. Once you are in a relationship then technology can start to drive you apart. People can become obsessed with their phone or other device to the point that you feel like your partner is ignoring you for the device. This is an issue when people use technology to find love but then don't ever disconnect from it. People need to learn that there is too much of a good thing. Find what you need and then get out with technology. You already found love so what else is in your phone that is more important?

Find what you need and then get out with technology. You already found love so what else is in your phone that is more important?

Technology is perfect to meet someone new. It will help you find that special person no matter what

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has definitely improved the dating scene. There's no more blind dates that go horribly wrong. You can now sit home and have a glass of wine while looking through profiles. It takes out a lot of the stress involved. It also makes it much easier to find a partner for certain kinks or fetishes. Not everyone is looking just for love. Some people are looking for something very specific and you'd never be able to find that without using a website or an app. If you look at it that way, it's bringing people together who would otherwise never have met.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has definitely improved the dating scene. There's no more blind dates that go horribly wrong. You can now sit home and have a glass of wine while looking through profiles. It takes out a lot of the stress involved. It also makes it much easier to find a partner for certain kinks or fetishes. Not everyone is looking just for love. Some people are looking for something very specific and you'd never be able to find that without using a website or an app. If you look at it that way, it's bringing people together who would otherwise never have met. 

As far as technology as a whole, it can be a mix of good and bad when it comes to dating. Once you are in a relationship then technology can start to drive you apart. People can become obsessed with their phone or other device to the point that you feel like your partner is ignoring you for the device. This is an issue when people use technology to find love but then don't ever disconnect from it. People need to learn that there is too much of a good thing. Find what you need and then get out with technology. You already found love so what else is in your phone that is more important?

Technology is perfect to meet someone new. It will help you find that special person no matter what you are looking for.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has definitely improved the dating scene. There's no more blind dates that go horribly wrong. You can now sit home and have a glass of wine while looking through profiles. It takes out a lot of the stress involved. It also makes it much easier to find a partner for certain kinks or fetishes. Not everyone is looking just for love. Some people are looking for something very specific and you'd never be able to find that without using a website or an app. If you look at it that way, it's bringing people together who would otherwise never have met. 

As far as technology as a whole, it can be a mix of good and bad when it comes to dating. Once you are in a relationship then technology can start to drive you apart. People can become obsessed with their phone or other device to the point that you feel like your partner is ignoring you for the device. This is an issue when people use technology to find love but then don't ever disconnect from it. People need to learn that there is too much of a good thing. Find what you need and then get out with technology. You already found love so what else is in your phone that is more important?

In my opinion, technology has definitely improved the dating scene. There's no more blind dates that go horribly wrong. You can now sit home and have a glass of wine while looking through profiles. It takes out a lot of the stress involved. It also makes it much easier to find a partner for certain kinks or fetishes. Not everyone is looking just for love.

People can become obsessed with their phone or other device to the point that you feel like your partner is ignoring you for the device.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has definitely improved the dating scene. There's no more blind dates that go horribly wrong. You can now sit home and have a glass of wine while looking through profiles. It takes out a lot of the stress involved. It also makes it much easier to find a partner for certain kinks or fetishes. Not everyone is looking just for love. Some people are looking for something very specific and you'd never be able to find that without using a website or an app. If you look at it that way, it's bringing people together who would otherwise never have met. 

As far as technology as a whole, it can be a mix of good and bad when it comes to dating. Once you are in a relationship then technology can start to drive you apart. People can become obsessed with their phone or other device to the point that you feel like your partner is ignoring you for the device. This is an issue when people use technology to find love but then don't ever disconnect from it. People need to learn that there is too much of a good thing.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has definitely improved the dating scene. There's no more blind dates that go horribly wrong. You can now sit home and have a glass of wine while looking through profiles. It takes out a lot of the stress involved. It also makes it much easier to find a partner for certain kinks or fetishes. Not everyone is looking just for love. Some people are looking for something very specific and you'd never be able to find that without using a website or an app. If you look at it that way, it's bringing people together who would otherwise never have met.

People can become obsessed with their phone or other device to the point that you feel like your partner is ignoring you for the device. This is an issue when people use technology to find love but then don't ever disconnect from it. People need to learn that there is too much of a good thing.

It takes out a lot of the stress involved. It also makes it much easier to find a partner for certain kinks or fetishes. Not everyone is looking just for love. Some people are looking for something very specific and you'd never be able to find that without using a website or an app. If you look at it that way, it's bringing people together who would otherwise never have met.

It takes out a lot of the stress involved. It also makes it much easier to find a partner for certain kinks or fetishes. Not everyone is looking just for love. Some people are looking for something very specific and you'd never be able to find that without using a website or an app. If you look at it that way, it's bringing people together who would otherwise never have met. 

As far as technology as a whole, it can be a mix of good and bad when it comes to dating. Once you are in a relationship then technology can start to drive you apart. People can become obsessed with their phone or other device to the point that you feel like your partner is ignoring you for the device. This is an issue when people use technology to find love but then don't ever disconnect from it. People need to learn that there is too much of a good thing. Find what you need and then get out with technology. You already found love so what else is in your phone that is more important?

Technology is perfect to meet someone new. It will help you find that special person no matter what you are looking for. However you need to know when to cut back on technology. When you are in a relationship, you need to find your love for each other and not let technology get in the way. So find that person online and then cut off your need for such technology right ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Some people are looking for something very specific and you'd never be able to find that without using a website or an app. If you look at it that way, it's bringing people together who would otherwise never have met. 

As far as technology as a whole, it can be a mix of good and bad when it comes to dating. Once you are in a relationship then technology can start to drive you apart. People can become obsessed with their phone or other device to the point that you feel like your partner is ignoring you for the device. This is an issue when people use technology to find love but then don't ever disconnect from it. People need to learn that there is too much of a good thing. Find what you need and then get out with technology. You already found love so what else is in your phone that is more important?

Technology is perfect to meet someone new. It will help you find that special person no matter what you are looking for. However you need to know when to cut back on technology. When you are in a relationship, you need to find your love for each other and not let technology get in the way. So find that person online and then cut off your need for such technology right after.

It takes out a lot of the stress involved. It also makes it much easier to find a partner for certain kinks or fetishes. Not everyone is looking just for love. Some people are looking for something very specific and you'd never be able to find that without using a website or an app. If you look at it that way, it's bringing people together who would otherwise never have met. 

As far as technology as a whole, it can be a mix of good and bad when it comes to dating. Once you are in a relationship then technology can start to drive you apart. People can become obsessed with their phone or other device to the point that you feel like your partner is ignoring you for the device. This is an issue when people use technology to find love but then don't ever disconnect from it. People need to learn that there is too much of a good thing. Find what you need and then get out with technology. You already found love so what else is in your phone that is more important?

Technology is perfect to meet someone new. It will help you find that special person no matter what you are looking for. However you need to know when to cut back on technology. When you are in a relationship, you need to find your love for each other and not let technology get in the way. So find that person online and then cut off your need for such technology right after.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has definitely improved the dating scene. There's no more blind dates that go horribly wrong. You can now sit home and have a glass of wine while looking through profiles. It takes out a lot of the stress involved. It also makes it much easier to find a partner for certain kinks or fetishes. Not everyone is looking just for love. Some people are looking for something very specific and you'd never be able to find that without using a website or an app. If you look at it that way, it's bringing people together who would otherwise never have met. 

As far as technology as a whole, it can be a mix of good and bad when it comes to dating. Once you are in a relationship then technology can start to drive you apart. People can become obsessed with their phone or other device to the point that you feel like your partner is ignoring you for the device. This is an issue when people use technology to find love but then don't ever disconnect from it. People need to learn that there is too much of a good thing. Find what you need and then get out with technology. You already found love so what else is in your phone that is more important?

Technology is perfect to meet someone new. It will help you find that special person no matter what you are looking for. However you need to know when to cut back on technology. When you are in a relationship, you need to find your love for each other and not let technology get in the way. So find that person online and then cut off your need for such technology right after.

In my opinion, technology has definitely improved the dating scene. There's no more blind dates that go horribly wrong. You can now sit home and have a glass of wine while looking through profiles. It takes out a lot of the stress involved. It also makes it much easier to find a partner for certain kinks or fetishes. Not everyone is looking just for love. Some people are looking for something very specific and you'd never be able to find that without using a website or an app. If you look at it that way, it's bringing people together who would otherwise never have met. 

As far as technology as a whole, it can be a mix of good and bad when it comes to dating. Once you are in a relationship then technology can start to drive you apart. People can become obsessed with their phone or other device to the point that you feel like your partner is ignoring you for the device. This is an issue when people use technology to find love but then don't ever disconnect from it. People need to learn that there is too much of a good thing.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

In my opinion, technology has definitely improved the dating scene. There's no more blind dates that go horribly wrong. You can now sit home and have a glass of wine while looking through profiles. It takes out a lot of the stress involved. It also makes it much easier to find a partner for certain kinks or fetishes. Not everyone is looking just for love. Some people are looking for something very specific and you'd never be able to find that without using a website or an app. If you look at it that way, it's bringing people together who would otherwise never have met. 

As far as technology as a whole, it can be a mix of good and bad when it comes to dating. Once you are in a relationship then technology can start to drive you apart. People can become obsessed with their phone or other device to the point that you feel like your partner is ignoring you for the device. This is an issue when people use technology to find love but then don't ever disconnect from it. People need to learn that there is too much of a good thing. Find what you need and then get out with technology. You already found love so what else is in your phone that is more important?
