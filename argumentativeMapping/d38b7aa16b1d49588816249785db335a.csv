Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains, and I have had a few close calls myself. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. M",user,12,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains, and I have had a few close calls myself. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains, and I have had a few close calls myself. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains, and I have had a few close calls myself. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it.

Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains, and I have had a few close calls myself. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt.

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains, and I have had a few close calls myself. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact,",user,32,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains, and I have had a few close calls myself. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb.

She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it.

Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate.

Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains, and I have had a few close calls myself. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So to",user,39,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down.

It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore.",user,8,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt.

The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it.

It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it.

 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb.

Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.

Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb.

 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep.

It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it.

Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey.

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn'",user,42,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.

 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinc",user,43,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain.

I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb.

I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely.

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely.

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. But with extreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely. In",user,45,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. But with extreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely. In fact, peopl",user,45,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. But with extreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely. In fact, people love the thrill of mountain climbing because it is dangerous.",api,45,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died.

Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. But with extreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely. In fact, people love the thrill of mountain climbing because it is dangerous. That's what led Matt to try mountain climbing in the first place.",api,46,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb.

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. And for naBut with extreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely. In fact, people love the thrill of mountain climbing because it is dangerous. That's what led Matt to try mountain climbing in the first place.",user,44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt.

Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. And for anyBut with extreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely. In fact, people love the thrill of mountain climbing because it is dangerous. That's what led Matt to try mountain climbing in the first place.",user,44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore.

Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. And for any sport that you canBut with extreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely. In fact, people love the thrill of mountain climbing because it is dangerous. That's what led Matt to try mountain climbing in the first place.",user,44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt.

 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died.

Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. And for any sport that you cannot participate in But with extreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely. In fact, people love the thrill of mountain climbing because it is dangerous. That's what led Matt to try mountain climbing in the first place.",user,44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt.

 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing.

Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. And for any sport that you cannot participate in safely, we should gBut with extreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely. In fact, people love the thrill of mountain climbing because it is dangerous. That's what led Matt to try mountain climbing in the first place.",user,44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt.

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. And for any sport that you cannot participate in safely, we should get rid of it as a sBut with extreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely. In fact, people love the thrill of mountain climbing because it is dangerous. That's what led Matt to try mountain climbing in the first place.",user,44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. And for any sport that you cannot participate in safely, we should get rid of it as a sport altoBut with extreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died.

 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. And for any sport that you cannot participate in safely, we should get rid of it as a sport altogether. It's in theBut with extreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely. In fact, people love the thrill of mountain climbing because it is dangerous. That's what led Matt to try mountain climbing in the first place.",user,45,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. And for any sport that you cannot participate in safely, we should get rid of it as a sport altogether. It's in the best intBut with extreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely.

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. And for any sport that you cannot participate in safely, we should get rid of it as a sport altogether. It's in the best interests of society and athletBut with extreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely. In fact, people love the thrill of mountain climbing because it is dangerous. That's what led Matt to try mountain climbing in the first place.",user,45,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not?

Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. And for any sport that you cannot participate in safely, we should get rid of it as a sport altogether.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. And for any sport that you cannot participate in safely, we should get rid of it as a sport altogether. It's in the best interests of society and athletes to do so. For xtreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely. In fact, people love the thrill of mountain climbing because it is dangerous.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb.

But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. And for any sport that you cannot participate in safely, we should get rid of it as a sport altogether. It's in the best interests of society and athletes to do so. For extreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely. In fact, people love the thrill of mountain climbing because it is dangerous. That's what led Matt to try mountain climbing in the first place.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.

I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. And for any sport that you cannot participate in safely, we should get rid of it as a sport altogether. It's in the best interests of society and athletes to do so. For extreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely. In fact, people love the thrill of mountain climbing because it is dangerous. That's what led Matt to try mountain climbing in the first place.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well.

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport.

And for any sport that you cannot participate in safely, we should get rid of it as a sport altogether. It's in the best interests of society and athletes to do so. For extreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely. In fact, people love the thrill of mountain climbing because it is dangerous. That's what led Matt to try mountain climbing in the first place.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.

I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. And for any sport that you cannot participate in safely, we should get rid of it as a sport altogether. It's in the best interests of society and athletes to do so. For extreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely. In fact, people love the thrill of mountain climbing because it is dangerous. That's what led Matt to try mountain climbing in the first place.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt.

I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. And for any sport that you cannot participate in safely, we should get rid of it as a sport altogether. It's in the best interests of society and athletes to do so. For extreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely. In fact, people love the thrill of mountain climbing because it is dangerous. That's what led Matt to try mountain climbing in the first place.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt.

 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. And for any sport that you cannot participate in safely, we should get rid of it as a sport altogether. It's in the best interests of society and athletes to do so. For extreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely. In fact, people love the thrill of mountain climbing because it is dangerous. That's what led Matt to try mountain climbing in the first place. I hope that people will realize that sports like mountain climbing are too dangerous to be called sports and that people.",user,49,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt.

 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. And for any sport that you cannot participate in safely, we should get rid of it as a sport altogether. It's in the best interests of society and athletes to do so. For extreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely. In fact, people love the thrill of mountain climbing because it is dangerous. That's what led Matt to try mountain climbing in the first place.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt.

I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. And for any sport that you cannot participate in safely, we should get rid of it as a sport altogether. It's in the best interests of society and athletes to do so. For extreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely. In fact, people love the thrill of mountain climbing because it is dangerous. That's what led Matt to try mountain climbing in the first place.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt.
