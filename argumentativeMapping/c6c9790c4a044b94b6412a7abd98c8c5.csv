I believe that pads and tampons are similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools. They are a basic life need.  They should be made easily accessible to students, just like toilet paper and soap. I believe no student should go without hygiene products and fear asking for help. I would promote this idea by speaking to my principal and other teachers about the importance of providing free pads and tampons in schools. It is a topic that some people are embarrassed to bring up. I would be willing to speak up and help make a difference. I would be willing to help improve health and hygiene for students.
