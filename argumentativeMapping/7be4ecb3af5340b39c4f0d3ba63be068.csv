In my opinion, tampons and pads are similar to toilet paper, soap, and other products that are already provided in schools because they are hygiene products. Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed.

In my opinion, tampons and pads are similar to toilet paper, soap, and other products that are already provided in schools because they are hygiene products. Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed.

Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essen",user,14,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fas periods.",user,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, tampons and pads are similar to toilet paper, soap, and other products that are already provided in schools because they are hygiene products. Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods.

The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods.

---

In my opinion, tampons and pads are similar to toilet paper, soap, and other products that are already provided in schools because they are hygiene products. Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods. Other than the sex ed classes, tampons or pads could be provided at the nurse' or other medical offices, and girls who aren't menstruating to this time can simply be informed of where they can obtain one if they",user,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, tampons and pads are similar to toilet paper, soap, and other products that are already provided in schools because they are hygiene products. Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods. Other than the sex ed classes, tampons or pads could be provided at the nurse's office, or other medical offices, and girls who aren't menstruating to this time can simply be informed of where they can obtain one if they need one during their period, without being lectured on whether or not they need their own pads or tampons, or whether they deserve to have them.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, tampons and pads are similar to toilet paper, soap, and other products that are already provided in schools because they are hygiene products. Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods. Other than the sex ed classes, tampons or pads could be provided at the nurse's office, or other medical offices, and girls who aren't menstruating to this time can simply be informed of where they can obtain one if they need one during their period, without being lectured on whether or not they need their own pads or tampons, or whether they deserve to have them.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, tampons and pads are similar to toilet paper, soap, and other products that are already provided in schools because they are hygiene products. Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods. Other than the sex ed classes, tampons or pads could be provided at the nurse's office, or other medical offices, and girls who aren't menstruating to this time can simply be informed of where they can obtain one if they need one during their period, without being lectured on whether or not they need their own pads or tampons, or whether they deserve to have them.

It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods. Other than the sex ed classes, tampons or pads could be provided at the nurse's office, or other medical offices, and girls who aren't menstruating to this time can simply be informed of where they can obtain one if they need one during their period, without being lectured on whether or not they need their own pads or tampons, or whether they deserve to have them.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, tampons and pads are similar to toilet paper, soap, and other products that are already provided in schools because they are hygiene products. Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, tampons and pads are similar to toilet paper, soap, and other products that are already provided in schools because they are hygiene products. Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods. Other than the sex ed classes, tampons or pads could be provided at the nurse's office, or other medical offices, and girls who aren't menstruating to this time can simply be informed of where they can obtain one if they need one during their period, without being lectured on whether or not they need their own pads or tampons, or whether they deserve to have them.

Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods. Other than the sex ed classes, tampons or pads could be provided at the nurse's office, or other medical offices, and girls who aren't menstruating to this time can simply be informed of where they can obtain one if they need one during their period, without being lectured on whether or not they need their own pads or tampons, or whether they deserve to have them.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, tampons and pads are similar to toilet paper, soap, and other products that are already provided in schools because they are hygiene products. Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods. Other than the sex ed classes, tampons or pads could be provided at the nurse's office, or other medical offices, and girls who aren't menstruating to this time can simply be informed of where they can obtain one if they need one during their period, without being lectured on whether or not they need their own pads or tampons, or whether they deserve to have them.

Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods. Other than the sex ed classes, tampons or pads could be provided at the nurse's office, or other medical offices, and girls who aren't menstruating to this time can simply be informed of where they can obtain one if they need one during their period, without being lectured on whether or not they need their own pads or tampons, or whether they deserve to have them.

Being male, I of course have never experienced ""period poverty"" or period shaming, but I did go to school, and I know students can be very cruel.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, tampons and pads are similar to toilet paper, soap, and other products that are already provided in schools because they are hygiene products. Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods. Other than the sex ed classes, tampons or pads could be provided at the nurse's office, or other medical offices, and girls who aren't menstruating to this time can simply be informed of where they can obtain one if they need one during their period, without being lectured on whether or not they need their own pads or tampons, or whether they deserve to have them.

Being male, I of course have never experienced ""period poverty"" or period shaming, but I did go to school, and I know students can be very cruel. The school owes it to young women to acknowledge and respect their physical needs as best they can, without creating an atmosphere of shame.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, tampons and pads are similar to toilet paper, soap, and other products that are already provided in schools because they are hygiene products. Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods. Other than the sex ed classes, tampons or pads could be provided at the nurse's office, or other medical offices, and girls who aren't menstruating to this time can simply be informed of where they can obtain one if they need one during their period, without being lectured on whether or not they need their own pads or tampons, or whether they deserve to have them.

If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods. Other than the sex ed classes, tampons or pads could be provided at the nurse's office, or other medical offices, and girls who aren't menstruating to this time can simply be informed of where they can obtain one if they need one during their period, without being lectured on whether or not they need their own pads or tampons, or whether they deserve to have them.

Being male, I of course have never experienced ""period poverty"" or period shaming, but I did go to school, and I know students can be very cruel. The school owes it to young women to acknowledge and respect their physical needs as best they can, without creating an atmosphere of shame. If needed, students who engage in hurtful behavior towards young women related to periods, or otherwise,can be disciplined in accordance with school policies.",user,18,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

Being male, I of course have never experienced ""period poverty"" or period shaming, but I did go to school, and I know students can be very cruel. The school owes it to young women to acknowledge and respect their physical needs as best they can, without creating an atmosphere of shame. If needed, students who engage in hurtful behavior towards young women related to periods, can be disciplined in accordance with school policies. W",user,19,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
text-insert,"Should Schools Provide Free Pads and Tampons?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, tampons and pads are similar to toilet paper, soap, and other products that are already provided in schools because they are hygiene products. Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, tampons and pads are similar to toilet paper, soap, and other products that are already provided in schools because they are hygiene products. Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods. Other than the sex ed classes, tampons or pads could be provided at the nurse's office, or other medical offices, and girls who aren't menstruating to this time can simply be informed of where they can obtain one if they need one during their period, without being lectured on whether or not they need their own pads or tampons, or whether they deserve to have them.

Being male, I of course have never experienced ""period poverty"" or period shaming, but I did go to school, and I know students can be very cruel. The school owes it to young women to acknowledge and respect their physical needs as best they can, without creating an atmosphere of shame. If needed, students who engage in hurtful behavior towards young women related to periods, can be disciplined in accordance with school policies.

The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods. Other than the sex ed classes, tampons or pads could be provided at the nurse's office, or other medical offices, and girls who aren't menstruating to this time can simply be informed of where they can obtain one if they need one during their period, without being lectured on whether or not they need their own pads or tampons, or whether they deserve to have them.

Being male, I of course have never experienced ""period poverty"" or period shaming, but I did go to school, and I know students can be very cruel. The school owes it to young women to acknowledge and respect their physical needs as best they can, without creating an atmosphere of shame. If needed, students who engage in hurtful behavior towards young women related to periods, can be disciplined in accordance with school policies.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, tampons and pads are similar to toilet paper, soap, and other products that are already provided in schools because they are hygiene products. Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate.

If needed, students who engage in hurtful behavior towards young women related to periods, can be disciplined in accordance with school policies. With all of these policies in effect, hopefully school will be a more comfortable and supportive place for young women who are menstruating, and it will become clear to everyone that periods do not define women in any kind of a negative way.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, tampons and pads are similar to toilet paper, soap, and other products that are already provided in schools because they are hygiene products. Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods. Other than the sex ed classes, tampons or pads could be provided at the nurse's office, or other medical offices, and girls who aren't menstruating to this time can simply be informed of where they can obtain one if they need one during their period, without being lectured on whether or not they need their own pads or tampons, or whether they deserve to have them.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, tampons and pads are similar to toilet paper, soap, and other products that are already provided in schools because they are hygiene products. Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods. Other than the sex ed classes, tampons or pads could be provided at the nurse's office, or other medical offices, and girls who aren't menstruating to this time can simply be informed of where they can obtain one if they need one during their period, without being lectured on whether or not they need their own pads or tampons, or whether they deserve to have them.

Being male, I of course have never experienced ""period poverty"" or period shaming, but I did go to school, and I know students can be very cruel. The school owes it to young women to acknowledge and respect their physical needs as best they can, without creating an atmosphere of shame. If needed, students who engage in hurtful behavior towards young women related to periods, can be disciplined in accordance with school policies. With all of these policies in effect, hopefully school will be a more comfortable and supportive place for young women who are menstruating, and it will become clear to everyone that periods do not define women in any kind of a negative way.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, tampons and pads are similar to toilet paper, soap, and other products that are already provided in schools because they are hygiene products. Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods. Other than the sex ed classes, tampons or pads could be provided at the nurse's office, or other medical offices, and girls who aren't menstruating to this time can simply be informed of where they can obtain one if they need one during their period, without being lectured on whether or not they need their own pads or tampons, or whether they deserve to have them.

Being male, I of course have never experienced ""period poverty"" or period shaming, but I did go to school, and I know students can be very cruel.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, tampons and pads are similar to toilet paper, soap, and other products that are already provided in schools because they are hygiene products. Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods. Other than the sex ed classes, tampons or pads could be provided at the nurse's office, or other medical offices, and girls who aren't menstruating to this time can simply be informed of where they can obtain one if they need one during their period, without being lectured on whether or not they need their own pads or tampons, or whether they deserve to have them.

Being male, I of course have never experienced ""period poverty"" or period shaming, but I did go to school, and I know students can be very cruel. The school owes it to young women to acknowledge and respect their physical needs as best they can, without creating an atmosphere of shame. If needed, students who engage in hurtful behavior towards young women related to periods, can be disciplined in accordance with school policies. With all of these policies in effect, hopefully school will be a more comfortable and supportive place for young women who are menstruating, and it will become clear to everyone that periods do not define women in any kind of a negative way.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, tampons and pads are similar to toilet paper, soap, and other products that are already provided in schools because they are hygiene products. Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods. Other than the sex ed classes, tampons or pads could be provided at the nurse's office, or other medical offices, and girls who aren't menstruating to this time can simply be informed of where they can obtain one if they need one during their period, without being lectured on whether or not they need their own pads or tampons, or whether they deserve to have them.

Other than the sex ed classes, tampons or pads could be provided at the nurse's office, or other medical offices, and girls who aren't menstruating to this time can simply be informed of where they can obtain one if they need one during their period, without being lectured on whether or not they need their own pads or tampons, or whether they deserve to have them.

Being male, I of course have never experienced ""period poverty"" or period shaming, but I did go to school, and I know students can be very cruel. The school owes it to young women to acknowledge and respect their physical needs as best they can, without creating an atmosphere of shame. If needed, students who engage in hurtful behavior towards young women related to periods, can be disciplined in accordance with school policies.

Being male, I of course have never experienced ""period poverty"" or period shaming, but I did go to school, and I know students can be very cruel. The school owes it to young women to acknowledge and respect their physical needs as best they can, without creating an atmosphere of shame. If needed, students who engage in hurtful behavior towards young women related to periods, can be disciplined in accordance with school policies.

text-insert,"Should Schools Provide Free Pads and Tampons?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, tampons and pads are similar to toilet paper, soap, and other products that are already provided in schools because they are hygiene products. Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.
