Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, yes, schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons to students who need them.  believe that pads and tampons are similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools
. I also believe that having access to those items can protect students from experiencing the shame that can go with not being able to afford these items. And that could also mean protecting them from humiliation if others see or if, heaven forbid, another student vocally ridicules them. I've heard opponents of my opinion suggest that pads and tampons are very different from the Band-Aids and other items I've mentioned because they are used my all genders. But in response, I would say that without period items supplied, females are unfairly more vulnerable to this type of embarrassment from which they should be protected in order for things to be truly fair.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, yes, schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons to students who need them.  believe that pads and tampons are similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools
. I also believe that having access to those items can protect students from experiencing the shame that can go with not being able to afford these items. And that could also mean protecting them from humiliation if others see or if, heaven forbid, another student vocally ridicules them. I've heard opponents of my opinion suggest that pads and tampons are very different from the Band-Aids and other items I've mentioned because they are used my all genders. But in response, I would say that without period items supplied, females are unfairly more vulnerable to this type of embarrassment from which they should be protected in order for things to be truly fair. 
I have experienced what they call ""period poverty"" myself. It's horrible and distracting to deal with. I can imagine that it would interfere with a young lady's education for sure.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

And that could also mean protecting them from humiliation if others see or if, heaven forbid, another student vocally ridicules them. I've heard opponents of my opinion suggest that pads and tampons are very different from the Band-Aids and other items I've mentioned because they are used my all genders.
