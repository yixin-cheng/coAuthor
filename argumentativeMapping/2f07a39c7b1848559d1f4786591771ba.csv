In my opinion, technology can have a bad effect on dating, particularly social media. For one, it makes it easier for people to falsely portray themselves. Instead of focusing on getting to know other people at a deep level, social media has a tendency to encourage people to focus on their own image of surface level appearances and experiences. I think this contributes to unhealthy comparisons between people, which can lead to insecurity and all around unhealthy ways of relating to people.
