In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people have no particular duty to keep up with the news. Paul Simon's lyric that, ""I get all the news I need from the weather report"" is valid and I can respect that (""mad props"" as they say).

But.

It makes me crazy when people who make absolutely no effort to be informed then sign on for idiotic, half-baked doctrines they have picked up from their friends and/or on social media.
I am not saying that everyone has to be a news junkie.
 But if you have not read a newspaper in months, don't go telling me that the COVID vaccine is really a bar code, or that Democrats are running a pedophile ring out of a pizzeria in Washington state.

Because it makes you look like an idiot.   don't want to be friends with an idiot. nrwith someone who is so lazy that they can't be bothered to keep up with the news.


When I was a kid, I imagined that the chief threat to American democracy could be found overseas. Obviously, I was wrong. The threat to our democracy is right here at home, among those semi-literates who agree with the January 6 riot in DC intended to overthrow American democracy and the cynical, defeated President who cheered on a coup attempting to install him as a Dictator.

So it's fine to ignore the news. Just make sure that your ignorance doesn't then become the news.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, people have no particular duty to keep up with the news. Paul Simon's lyric that, ""I get all the news I need from the weather report"" is valid and I can respect that (""mad props"" as they say).

But.

It makes me crazy when people who make absolutely no effort to be informed then sign on for idiotic, half-baked doctrines they have picked up from their friends and/or on social media.
I am not saying that everyone has to be a news junkie.
 But if you have not read a newspaper in months, don't tellng me that the COVID vaccine is really a bar code, or that Democrats are running a pedophile ring out of a pizzeria in Washington state.

Because it makes you look like an idiot.   don't want to be friends with an idiot. nrwith someone who is so lazy that they can't be bothered to keep up with the news.


When I was a kid, I imagined that the chief threat to American democracy could be found overseas. Obviously, I was wrong. The threat to our democracy is right here at home, among those semi-literates who agree with the January 6 riot in DC intended to overthrow American democracy and the cynical, defeated President who cheered on a coup attempting to install him as a Dictator.

So it's fine to ignore the news. Just make sure that your ignorance doesn't then become the news.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people have no particular duty to keep up with the news. Paul Simon's lyric that, ""I get all the news I need from the weather report"" is valid and I can respect that (""mad props"" as they say).

But.

It makes me crazy when people who make absolutely no effort to be informed then sign on for idiotic, half-baked doctrines they have picked up from their friends and/or on social media.
I am not saying that everyone has to be a news junkie.
 But if you have not read a newspaper in months, don't tell me that the COVID vaccine is really a bar code, or that top Democrats are running a pedophile ring out of a pizzeria in Washington state.

Tese makes you look like an idiot.   don't want to be friends with an idiot. nrwith someone who is so lazy that they can't be bothered to keep up with the news.


When I was a kid, I imagined that the chief threat to American democracy could be found overseas. Obviously, I was wrong. The threat to our democracy is right here at home, among those semi-literates who agree with the January 6 riot in DC intended to overthrow American democracy and the cynical, defeated President who cheered on a coup attempting to install him as a Dictator.

So it's fine to ignore the news. Just make sure that your ignorance doesn't then become the news.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people have no particular duty to keep up with the news. Paul Simon's lyric that, ""I get all the news I need from the weather report"" is valid and I can respect that (""mad props"" as they say).

But.

It makes me crazy when people who make absolutely no effort to be informed then sign on for idiotic, half-baked doctrines they have picked up from their friends and/or on social media.
I am not saying that everyone has to be a news junkie.
 But if you have not read a newspaper in months, don't tell me that the COVID vaccine is really a bar code, or that top Democrats are running a pedophile ring out of a pizzeria in Washington state.

Statements lik makes you look like an idiot.   don't want to be friends with an idiot. nrwith someone who is so lazy that they can't be bothered to keep up with the news.


When I was a kid, I imagined that the chief threat to American democracy could be found overseas. Obviously, I was wrong. The threat to our democracy is right here at home, among those semi-literates who agree with the January 6 riot in DC intended to overthrow American democracy and the cynical, defeated President who cheered on a coup attempting to install him as a Dictator.

So it's fine to ignore the news. Just make sure that your ignorance doesn't then become the news.

It makes me crazy when people who make absolutely no effort to be informed then sign on for idiotic, half-baked doctrines they have picked up from their friends and/or on social media.
I am not saying that everyone has to be a news junkie.
 But if you have not read a newspaper in months, don't tell me that the COVID vaccine is really a bar code, or that top Democrats are running a pedophile ring out of a pizzeria in Washington state.

When I was a kid, I imagined that the chief threat to American democracy could be found overseas. Obviously, I was wrong.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, people have no particular duty to keep up with the news. Paul Simon's lyric that, ""I get all the news I need from the weather report"" is valid and I can respect that (""mad props"" as they say).

But.

It makes me crazy when people who make absolutely no effort to be informed then sign on for idiotic, half-baked doctrines they have picked up from their friends and/or on social media.
I am not saying that everyone has to be a news junkie.
 But if you have not read a newspaper in months, don't tell me that the COVID vaccine is really a bar code, or that top Democrats are running a pedophile ring out of a pizzeria in Washington state.

Statements like this make you look like an idiot.   don't wparticularly ant to be friends with an idiot., ith someone who is so lazy that they can't be bothered to keep up with the news.


When I was a kid, I imagined that the chief threat to American democracy could be found overseas. Obviously, I was wrong.
