The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. M",user,21,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On",user,23,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends.

I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time.

Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad.

The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day.

The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ul",user,27,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done.""

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time.

Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana.

 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time.

Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy.

 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad.

 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana.

I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad.

I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time.

Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad.

 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends.

 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask",user,32,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Fran",user,33,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done.""

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode",user,33,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court.

When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done.""

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.

 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time.

Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad.

Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For exa",user,38,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game ",user,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper re",user,39,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper really enjo",user,39,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life.

I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper really enjoys is called ""Math Bingo.""

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper really enjoys is called ""Math Bingo.""

I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper really enjoys is called ""Math Bingo.""

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper really enjoys is called ""Math Bingo.""

I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper really enjoys is called ""Math Bingo.""

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life.

So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper really enjoys is called ""Math Bingo.""

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad.

 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper really enjoys is called ""Math Bingo.""

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper really enjoys is called ""Math Bingo.""

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time.

Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper really enjoys is called ""Math Bingo.""

Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper really enjoys is called ""Math Bingo."" She's learning math while playing the game. And she's learning to read while playing ""Sesame Street."" But at the same time I just really don't want to go down a rabbit hole with Harper where she's just sitting on her iPad all day. Gr",user,43,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper really enjoys is called ""Math Bingo."" She's learning math while playing the game. And she's learning to read while playing ""Sesame Street."" But at the same time I just really don't want to go down a rabbit hole with Harper where she's just sitting on her iPad all day. Growing ki",user,43,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time.

So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper really enjoys is called ""Math Bingo."" She's learning math while playing the game. And she's learning to read while playing ""Sesame Street.""

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper really enjoys is called ""Math Bingo."" She's learning math while playing the game. And she's learning to read while playing ""Sesame Street."" But at the same time I just really don't want to go down a rabbit hole with Harper where she's just sitting on her iPad all day. Growing kids need to be active and they need to be social.

 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper really enjoys is called ""Math Bingo."" She's learning math while playing the game. And she's learning to read while playing ""Sesame Street."" But at the same time I just really don't want to go down a rabbit hole with Harper where she's just sitting on her iPad all day. Growing kids need to be active and they need to be social.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper really enjoys is called ""Math Bingo."" She's learning math while playing the game. And she's learning to read while playing ""Sesame Street."" But at the same time I just really don't want to go down a rabbit hole with Harper where she's just sitting on her iPad all day. Growing kids need to be active and they need to be social.

Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper really enjoys is called ""Math Bingo."" She's learning math while playing the game. And she's learning to read while playing ""Sesame Street."" But at the same time I just really don't want to go down a rabbit hole with Harper where she's just sitting on her iPad all day. Growing kids need to be active and they need to be social. So this is where I come out on this issue, and I'm sure that there are many other parents out there who feel the same way. ",user,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato, s What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper really enjoys is called ""Math Bingo."" She's learning math while playing the game. And she's learning to read while playing ""Sesame Street."" But at the same time I just really don't want to go down a rabbit hole with Harper where she's just sitting on her iPad all day. Growing kids need to be active and they need to be social. So this is where I come out on this issue, and I'm sure that there are many other parents out there who feel the same way. ",user,29,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato, since tha What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper really enjoys is called ""Math Bingo."" She's learning math while playing the game. And she's learning to read while playing ""Sesame Street."" But at the same time I just really don't want to go down a rabbit hole with Harper where she's just sitting on her iPad all day. Growing kids need to be active and they need to be social. So this is where I come out on this issue, and I'm sure that there are many other parents out there who feel the same way. ",user,29,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad.

Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper really enjoys is called ""Math Bingo."" She's learning math while playing the game. And she's learning to read while playing ""Sesame Street."" But at the same time I just really don't want to go down a rabbit hole with Harper where she's just sitting on her iPad all day. Growing kids need to be active and they need to be social.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato, since that could negative What happened to the days when kids played outside?

So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic.

 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.
