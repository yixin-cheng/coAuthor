In my opinion, in school young people should learn how to think. What I mean by this is they need to understand basic concepts which is fine but they need to be able to really understand the basics such as Scientific Method, which enables them to use this frame work to study things and evaluate information. Just because someone says something is true, for instance, doesn't mean it is. Critical thinking and scientific understanding hold up society and propel learning forward.

Being able to reason, understand facts, and make discoveries on their own are helped by these basis. Scientific method, Critical thinking, and independent thinking are excellent basis for all sorts of different lives. These include people who are scientists, political persons, Factory engineers, Computer programmers, and social scientists. Economics, math, and all sorts of reasoning need this basis, the basis of being able to reason, to work an equation, to figure and juxtapose different ideas onto different frameworks.
The most important thing I have learned in school is how to think.
 Reasoning and logic are philosophical, Scientific, mathmatical, Economic, and touch all aspects of life and business.  Being able to get confidence in ideas is also part of mastering thinking skills. The idea that making an error or coming up with an erroneous thought as being bad is also wrong. Thinking means adopting your ideas with changes in facts, changes in the world, and living life.  Admitting your wrong is more important than holding out because you were simply told something. Understanding and adapting are part of thinking and necessary for children to learn in school.

In my opinion, in school young people should learn how to think. What I mean by this is they need to understand basic concepts which is fine but they need to be able to really understand the basics such as Scientific Method, which enables them to use this frame work to study things and evaluate information. Just because someone says something is true, for instance, doesn't mean it is. Critical thinking and scientific understanding hold up society and propel learning forward.

Being able to reason, understand facts, and make discoveries on their own are helped by these basis. Scientific method, Critical thinking, and independent thinking are excellent basis for all sorts of different lives. These include people who are scientists, political persons, Factory engineers, Computer programmers, and social scientists. Economics, math, and all sorts of reasoning need this basis, the basis of being able to reason, to work an equation, to figure and juxtapose different ideas onto different frameworks.
The most important thing I have learned in school is how to think.
 Reasoning and logic are philosophical, Scientific, mathmatical, Economic, and touch all aspects of life and business.  Being able to get confidence in ideas is also part of mastering thinking skills. The idea that making an error or coming up with an erroneous thought as being bad is also wrong. Thinking means adopting your ideas with changes in facts, changes in the world, and living life.  Admitting your wrong is more important than holding out because you were simply told something. Understanding and adapting are part of thinking and necessary for children to learn in school.

In my opinion, in school young people should learn how to think.

What I mean by this is they need to understand basic concepts which is fine but they need to be able to really understand the basics such as Scientific Method, which enables them to use this frame work to study things and evaluate information. Just because someone says something is true, for instance, doesn't mean it is. Critical thinking and scientific understanding hold up society and propel learning forward.

Being able to reason, understand facts, and make discoveries on their own are helped by these basis. Scientific method, Critical thinking, and independent thinking are excellent basis for all sorts of different lives. These include people who are scientists, political persons, Factory engineers, Computer programmers, and social scientists. Economics, math, and all sorts of reasoning need this basis, the basis of being able to reason, to work an equation, to figure and juxtapose different ideas onto different frameworks.
The most important thing I have learned in school is how to think.
 Reasoning and logic are philosophical, Scientific, mathmatical, Economic, and touch all aspects of life and business.  Being able to get confidence in ideas is also part of mastering thinking skills. The idea that making an error or coming up with an erroneous thought as being bad is also wrong. Thinking means adopting your ideas with changes in facts, changes in the world, and living life.  Admitting your wrong is more important than holding out because you were simply told something. Understanding and adapting are part of thinking and necessary for children to learn in school.

In my opinion, in school young people should learn how to think. What I mean by this is they need to understand basic concepts which is fine but they need to be able to really understand the basics such as Scientific Method, which enables them to use this frame work to study things and evaluate information. Just because someone says something is true, for instance, doesn't mean it is. Critical thinking and scientific understanding hold up society and propel learning forward.

Being able to reason, understand facts, and make discoveries on their own are helped by these basis. Scientific method, Critical thinking, and independent thinking are excellent basis for all sorts of different lives. These include people who are scientists, political persons, Factory engineers, Computer programmers, and social scientists. Economics, math, and all sorts of reasoning need this basis, the basis of being able to reason, to work an equation, to figure and juxtapose different ideas onto different frameworks.
The most important thing I have learned in school is how to think.
 Reasoning and logic are philosophical, Scientific, mathmatical, Economic, and touch all aspects of life and business.  Being able to get confidence in ideas is also part of mastering thinking skills. The idea that making an error or coming up with an erroneous thought as being bad is also wrong. Thinking means adopting your ideas with changes in facts, changes in the world, and living life.  Admitting your wrong is more important than holding out because you were simply told something. Understanding and adapting are part of thinking and necessary for children to learn in school.
I think this will help my success in the future because I will be able to adapt to new situations, understand new ideas, and reason through
, it also helps young people who are in school. It's important that they learn the basic building blocks of thought. Learning what is possible, what can be done if they try is helped by learning the scientific method. Ask why, ask Why not? Ask how. All quetionin",user,26,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Thinking means adopting your ideas with changes in facts, changes in the world, and living life.  Admitting your wrong is more important than holding out because you were simply told something. Understanding and adapting are part of thinking and necessary for children to learn in school.

In my opinion, in school young people should learn how to think. What I mean by this is they need to understand basic concepts which is fine but they need to be able to really understand the basics such as Scientific Method, which enables them to use this frame work to study things and evaluate information. Just because someone says something is true, for instance, doesn't mean it is. Critical thinking and scientific understanding hold up society and propel learning forward.

Being able to reason, understand facts, and make discoveries on their own are helped by these basis. Scientific method, Critical thinking, and independent thinking are excellent basis for all sorts of different lives. These include people who are scientists, political persons, Factory engineers, Computer programmers, and social scientists. Economics, math, and all sorts of reasoning need this basis, the basis of being able to reason, to work an equation, to figure and juxtapose different ideas onto different frameworks.
The most important thing I have learned in school is how to think.
 Reasoning and logic are philosophical, Scientific, mathmatical, Economic, and touch all aspects of life and business.  Being able to get confidence in ideas is also part of mastering thinking skills. The idea that making an error or coming up with an erroneous thought as being bad is also wrong. Thinking means adopting your ideas with changes in facts, changes in the world, and living life.  Admitting your wrong is more important than holding out because you were simply told something. Understanding and adapting are part of thinking and necessary for children to learn in school.
I think this will help my success in the future because I will be able to adapt to new situations, understand new ideas, and reason through
, it also helps young people who are in school. It's important that they learn the basic building blocks of thought. Learning what is possible, what can be done if they try is helped by learning the scientific method. Ask why, ask Why not? Ask how. All questioning is good, answers are better.

What I mean by this is they need to understand basic concepts which is fine but they need to be able to really understand the basics such as Scientific Method, which enables them to use this frame work to study things and evaluate information. Just because someone says something is true, for instance, doesn't mean it is. Critical thinking and scientific understanding hold up society and propel learning forward.

Being able to reason, understand facts, and make discoveries on their own are helped by these basis. Scientific method, Critical thinking, and independent thinking are excellent basis for all sorts of different lives. These include people who are scientists, political persons, Factory engineers, Computer programmers, and social scientists. Economics, math, and all sorts of reasoning need this basis, the basis of being able to reason, to work an equation, to figure and juxtapose different ideas onto different frameworks.
The most important thing I have learned in school is how to think.
 Reasoning and logic are philosophical, Scientific, mathmatical, Economic, and touch all aspects of life and business.  Being able to get confidence in ideas is also part of mastering thinking skills. The idea that making an error or coming up with an erroneous thought as being bad is also wrong. Thinking means adopting your ideas with changes in facts, changes in the world, and living life.  Admitting your wrong is more important than holding out because you were simply told something. Understanding and adapting are part of thinking and necessary for children to learn in school.

Learning what is possible, what can be done if they try is helped by learning the scientific method. Ask why, ask Why not? Ask how. All questioning is good, answers are better.

Thinking means adopting your ideas with changes in facts, changes in the world, and living life.  Admitting your wrong is more important than holding out because you were simply told something. Understanding and adapting are part of thinking and necessary for children to learn in school.
I think this will help my success in the future because I will be able to adapt to new situations, understand new ideas, and reason through
, it also helps young people who are in school. It's important that they learn the basic building blocks of thought. Learning what is possible, what can be done if they try is helped by learning the scientific method. Ask why, ask Why not? Ask how. All questioning is good, answers are better. Learning things is a life long journey and young people should be armed with strong reasoning skills. The Scientific method of understanding how to test theory, how to prove processes is helpful here.

In my opinion, in school young people should learn how to think. What I mean by this is they need to understand basic concepts which is fine but they need to be able to really understand the basics such as Scientific Method, which enables them to use this frame work to study things and evaluate information. Just because someone says something is true, for instance, doesn't mean it is. Critical thinking and scientific understanding hold up society and propel learning forward.

Being able to reason, understand facts, and make discoveries on their own are helped by these basis. Scientific method, Critical thinking, and independent thinking are excellent basis for all sorts of different lives. These include people who are scientists, political persons, Factory engineers, Computer programmers, and social scientists. Economics, math, and all sorts of reasoning need this basis, the basis of being able to reason, to work an equation, to figure and juxtapose different ideas onto different frameworks.

Being able to get confidence in ideas is also part of mastering thinking skills. The idea that making an error or coming up with an erroneous thought as being bad is also wrong. Thinking means adopting your ideas with changes in facts, changes in the world, and living life.  Admitting your wrong is more important than holding out because you were simply told something. Understanding and adapting are part of thinking and necessary for children to learn in school.
I think this will help my success in the future because I will be able to adapt to new situations, understand new ideas, and reason through
, it also helps young people who are in school. It's important that they learn the basic building blocks of thought. Learning what is possible, what can be done if they try is helped by learning the scientific method. Ask why, ask Why not? Ask how. All questioning is good, answers are better. Learning things is a life long journey and young people should be armed with strong reasoning skills. The Scientific method of understanding how to test theory, how to prove processes is helpful here.

In my opinion, in school young people should learn how to think. What I mean by this is they need to understand basic concepts which is fine but they need to be able to really understand the basics such as Scientific Method, which enables them to use this frame work to study things and evaluate information. Just because someone says something is true, for instance, doesn't mean it is. Critical thinking and scientific understanding hold up society and propel learning forward.

Being able to reason, understand facts, and make discoveries on their own are helped by these basis. Scientific method, Critical thinking, and independent thinking are excellent basis for all sorts of different lives. These include people who are scientists, political persons, Factory engineers, Computer programmers, and social scientists. Economics, math, and all sorts of reasoning need this basis, the basis of being able to reason, to work an equation, to figure and juxtapose different ideas onto different frameworks.

Economics, math, and all sorts of reasoning need this basis, the basis of being able to reason, to work an equation, to figure and juxtapose different ideas onto different frameworks.
The most important thing I have learned in school is how to think.
 Reasoning and logic are philosophical, Scientific, mathmatical, Economic, and touch all aspects of life and business.  Being able to get confidence in ideas is also part of mastering thinking skills. The idea that making an error or coming up with an erroneous thought as being bad is also wrong. Thinking means adopting your ideas with changes in facts, changes in the world, and living life.  Admitting your wrong is more important than holding out because you were simply told something. Understanding and adapting are part of thinking and necessary for children to learn in school.
I think this will help my success in the future because I will be able to adapt to new situations, understand new ideas, and reason through
, it also helps young people who are in school. It's important that they learn the basic building blocks of thought. Learning what is possible, what can be done if they try is helped by learning the scientific method. Ask why, ask Why not? Ask how. All questioning is good, answers are better. Learning things is a life long journey and young people should be armed with strong reasoning skills. The Scientific method of understanding how to test theory, how to prove processes is helpful here.

Just because someone says something is true, for instance, doesn't mean it is. Critical thinking and scientific understanding hold up society and propel learning forward.

Being able to reason, understand facts, and make discoveries on their own are helped by these basis. Scientific method, Critical thinking, and independent thinking are excellent basis for all sorts of different lives. These include people who are scientists, political persons, Factory engineers, Computer programmers, and social scientists. Economics, math, and all sorts of reasoning need this basis, the basis of being able to reason, to work an equation, to figure and juxtapose different ideas onto different frameworks.
The most important thing I have learned in school is how to think.
 Reasoning and logic are philosophical, Scientific, mathmatical, Economic, and touch all aspects of life and business.  Being able to get confidence in ideas is also part of mastering thinking skills. The idea that making an error or coming up with an erroneous thought as being bad is also wrong. Thinking means adopting your ideas with changes in facts, changes in the world, and living life.  Admitting your wrong is more important than holding out because you were simply told something. Understanding and adapting are part of thinking and necessary for children to learn in school.
I think this will help my success in the future because I will be able to adapt to new situations, understand new ideas, and reason through
, it also helps young people who are in school. It's important that they learn the basic building blocks of thought. Learning what is possible, what can be done if they try is helped by learning the scientific method. Ask why, ask Why not? Ask how. All questioning is good, answers are better. Learning things is a life long journey and young people should be armed with strong reasoning skills. The Scientific method of understanding how to test theory, how to prove processes is helpful here.

In my opinion, in school young people should learn how to think. What I mean by this is they need to understand basic concepts which is fine but they need to be able to really understand the basics such as Scientific Method, which enables them to use this frame work to study things and evaluate information. Just because someone says something is true, for instance, doesn't mean it is. Critical thinking and scientific understanding hold up society and propel learning forward.

Being able to reason, understand facts, and make discoveries on their own are helped by these basis. Scientific method, Critical thinking, and independent thinking are excellent basis for all sorts of different lives. These include people who are scientists, political persons, Factory engineers, Computer programmers, and social scientists. Economics, math, and all sorts of reasoning need this basis, the basis of being able to reason, to work an equation, to figure and juxtapose different ideas onto different frameworks.
The most important thing I have learned in school is how to think.
 Reasoning and logic are philosophical, Scientific, mathmatical, Economic, and touch all aspects of life and business.  Being able to get confidence in ideas is also part of mastering thinking skills. The idea that making an error or coming up with an erroneous thought as being bad is also wrong. Thinking means adopting your ideas with changes in facts, changes in the world, and living life.  Admitting your wrong is more important than holding out because you were simply told something. Understanding and adapting are part of thinking and necessary for children to learn in school.
I think this will help my success in the future because I will be able to adapt to new situations, understand new ideas, and reason through
, it also helps young people who are in school. It's important that they learn the basic building blocks of thought. Learning what is possible, what can be done if they try is helped by learning the scientific method. Ask why, ask Why not? Ask how. All questioning is good, answers are better.

In my opinion, in school young people should learn how to think. What I mean by this is they need to understand basic concepts which is fine but they need to be able to really understand the basics such as Scientific Method, which enables them to use this frame work to study things and evaluate information. Just because someone says something is true, for instance, doesn't mean it is. Critical thinking and scientific understanding hold up society and propel learning forward.

Being able to reason, understand facts, and make discoveries on their own are helped by these basis. Scientific method, Critical thinking, and independent thinking are excellent basis for all sorts of different lives. These include people who are scientists, political persons, Factory engineers, Computer programmers, and social scientists. Economics, math, and all sorts of reasoning need this basis, the basis of being able to reason, to work an equation, to figure and juxtapose different ideas onto different frameworks.

What I mean by this is they need to understand basic concepts which is fine but they need to be able to really understand the basics such as Scientific Method, which enables them to use this frame work to study things and evaluate information. Just because someone says something is true, for instance, doesn't mean it is. Critical thinking and scientific understanding hold up society and propel learning forward.

Being able to reason, understand facts, and make discoveries on their own are helped by these basis. Scientific method, Critical thinking, and independent thinking are excellent basis for all sorts of different lives. These include people who are scientists, political persons, Factory engineers, Computer programmers, and social scientists. Economics, math, and all sorts of reasoning need this basis, the basis of being able to reason, to work an equation, to figure and juxtapose different ideas onto different frameworks.
The most important thing I have learned in school is how to think.
 Reasoning and logic are philosophical, Scientific, mathmatical, Economic, and touch all aspects of life and business.  Being able to get confidence in ideas is also part of mastering thinking skills. The idea that making an error or coming up with an erroneous thought as being bad is also wrong. Thinking means adopting your ideas with changes in facts, changes in the world, and living life.  Admitting your wrong is more important than holding out because you were simply told something. Understanding and adapting are part of thinking and necessary for children to learn in school.
I think this will help my success in the future because I will be able to adapt to new situations, understand new ideas, and reason through
, it also helps young people who are in school. It's important that they learn the basic building blocks of thought. Learning what is possible, what can be done if they try is helped by learning the scientific method. Ask why, ask Why not? Ask how. All questioning is good, answers are better. Learning things is a life long journey and young people should be armed with strong reasoning skills. The Scientific method of understanding how to test theory, how to prove processes is helpful here.

In my opinion, in school young people should learn how to think. What I mean by this is they need to understand basic concepts which is fine but they need to be able to really understand the basics such as Scientific Method, which enables them to use this frame work to study things and evaluate information. Just because someone says something is true, for instance, doesn't mean it is. Critical thinking and scientific understanding hold up society and propel learning forward.

Being able to reason, understand facts, and make discoveries on their own are helped by these basis. Scientific method, Critical thinking, and independent thinking are excellent basis for all sorts of different lives. These include people who are scientists, political persons, Factory engineers, Computer programmers, and social scientists. Economics, math, and all sorts of reasoning need this basis, the basis of being able to reason, to work an equation, to figure and juxtapose different ideas onto different frameworks.
The most important thing I have learned in school is how to think.
 Reasoning and logic are philosophical, Scientific, mathmatical, Economic, and touch all aspects of life and business.  Being able to get confidence in ideas is also part of mastering thinking skills. The idea that making an error or coming up with an erroneous thought as being bad is also wrong. Thinking means adopting your ideas with changes in facts, changes in the world, and living life.  Admitting your wrong is more important than holding out because you were simply told something. Understanding and adapting are part of thinking and necessary for children to learn in school.

In my opinion, in school young people should learn how to think. What I mean by this is they need to understand basic concepts which is fine but they need to be able to really understand the basics such as Scientific Method, which enables them to use this frame work to study things and evaluate information. Just because someone says something is true, for instance, doesn't mean it is. Critical thinking and scientific understanding hold up society and propel learning forward.

Being able to reason, understand facts, and make discoveries on their own are helped by these basis. Scientific method, Critical thinking, and independent thinking are excellent basis for all sorts of different lives. These include people who are scientists, political persons, Factory engineers, Computer programmers, and social scientists. Economics, math, and all sorts of reasoning need this basis, the basis of being able to reason, to work an equation, to figure and juxtapose different ideas onto different frameworks.
The most important thing I have learned in school is how to think.
 Reasoning and logic are philosophical, Scientific, mathmatical, Economic, and touch all aspects of life and business.  Being able to get confidence in ideas is also part of mastering thinking skills. The idea that making an error or coming up with an erroneous thought as being bad is also wrong. Thinking means adopting your ideas with changes in facts, changes in the world, and living life.  Admitting your wrong is more important than holding out because you were simply told something. Understanding and adapting are part of thinking and necessary for children to learn in school.
I think this will help my success in the future because I will be able to adapt to new situations, understand new ideas, and reason through
, it also helps young people who are in school. It's important that they learn the basic building blocks of thought. Learning what is possible, what can be done if they try is helped by learning the scientific method. Ask why, ask Why not? Ask how. All questioning is good, answers are better. Learning things is a life long journey and young people should be armed with strong reasoning skills. The Scientific method of understanding how to test theory, how to prove processes is helpful here.

Support young people as they learn, ask and answer their questions. Support inquiry and help people when they have reasonable questions. S",user,31,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, in school young people should learn how to think. What I mean by this is they need to understand basic concepts which is fine but they need to be able to really understand the basics such as Scientific Method, which enables them to use this frame work to study things and evaluate information. Just because someone says something is true, for instance, doesn't mean it is. Critical thinking and scientific understanding hold up society and propel learning forward.

Being able to reason, understand facts, and make discoveries on their own are helped by these basis. Scientific method, Critical thinking, and independent thinking are excellent basis for all sorts of different lives. These include people who are scientists, political persons, Factory engineers, Computer programmers, and social scientists.

In my opinion, in school young people should learn how to think. What I mean by this is they need to understand basic concepts which is fine but they need to be able to really understand the basics such as Scientific Method, which enables them to use this frame work to study things and evaluate information. Just because someone says something is true, for instance, doesn't mean it is. Critical thinking and scientific understanding hold up society and propel learning forward.

Being able to reason, understand facts, and make discoveries on their own are helped by these basis. Scientific method, Critical thinking, and independent thinking are excellent basis for all sorts of different lives. These include people who are scientists, political persons, Factory engineers, Computer programmers, and social scientists.

The most important thing I have learned in school is how to think.
 Reasoning and logic are philosophical, Scientific, mathmatical, Economic, and touch all aspects of life and business.  Being able to get confidence in ideas is also part of mastering thinking skills. The idea that making an error or coming up with an erroneous thought as being bad is also wrong. Thinking means adopting your ideas with changes in facts, changes in the world, and living life.  Admitting your wrong is more important than holding out because you were simply told something.

What I mean by this is they need to understand basic concepts which is fine but they need to be able to really understand the basics such as Scientific Method, which enables them to use this frame work to study things and evaluate information. Just because someone says something is true, for instance, doesn't mean it is. Critical thinking and scientific understanding hold up society and propel learning forward.

Being able to reason, understand facts, and make discoveries on their own are helped by these basis. Scientific method, Critical thinking, and independent thinking are excellent basis for all sorts of different lives. These include people who are scientists, political persons, Factory engineers, Computer programmers, and social scientists. Economics, math, and all sorts of reasoning need this basis, the basis of being able to reason, to work an equation, to figure and juxtapose different ideas onto different frameworks.
The most important thing I have learned in school is how to think.
 Reasoning and logic are philosophical, Scientific, mathmatical, Economic, and touch all aspects of life and business.  Being able to get confidence in ideas is also part of mastering thinking skills. The idea that making an error or coming up with an erroneous thought as being bad is also wrong. Thinking means adopting your ideas with changes in facts, changes in the world, and living life.  Admitting your wrong is more important than holding out because you were simply told something. Understanding and adapting are part of thinking and necessary for children to learn in school.
I think this will help my success in the future because I will be able to adapt to new situations, understand new ideas, and reason through
, it also helps young people who are in school. It's important that they learn the basic building blocks of thought. Learning what is possible, what can be done if they try is helped by learning the scientific method. Ask why, ask Why not? Ask how. All questioning is good, answers are better. Learning things is a life long journey and young people should be armed with strong reasoning skills. The Scientific method of understanding how to test theory, how to prove processes is helpful here.

Support young people as they learn, ask and answer their questions. Support inquiry and help people when they have reasonable questions. Schools should support this. It's import",user,32,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
