In my opinion, technology has greatly improved dating. I've found that dating apps in particular increase the odds of finding a relationship, at least for me. Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Obviously there is still stress when it comes to dating even with the advancement of technology. Ultimately, no matter how well you know someone via the internet or via messaging apps, that first meeting is person is very nerve wracking. 
I think technology does a really good job in helping alleviate anxiety, but it never fully prepares you for a first impression.
 I may be extremely comfortable speaking to someone via text or messenger but may be too nervous in person and those nerves could show.

Personally, I have had a ton of experience as I am now 30 years old. I felt that over time I got less nervous. It's kind of like anything. The more you do something the more confident you get. I remember my first date I actually spoke to a girl online a ton. Meeting her I was so nervous because I really liked her and felt she liked me as well.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has greatly improved dating. I've found that dating apps in particular increase the odds of finding a relationship, at least for me. Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Obviously there is still stress when it comes to dating even with the advancement of technology. Ultimately, no matter how well you know someone via the internet or via messaging apps, that first meeting is person is very nerve wracking. 
I think technology does a really good job in helping alleviate anxiety, but it never fully prepares you for a first impression.
 I may be extremely comfortable speaking to someone via text or messenger but may be too nervous in person and those nerves could show.

Personally, I have had a ton of experience as I am now 30 years old. I felt that over time I got less nervous. It's kind of like anything. The more you do something the more confident you get.

In my opinion, technology has greatly improved dating. I've found that dating apps in particular increase the odds of finding a relationship, at least for me. Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Obviously there is still stress when it comes to dating even with the advancement of technology. Ultimately, no matter how well you know someone via the internet or via messaging apps, that first meeting is person is very nerve wracking. 
I think technology does a really good job in helping alleviate anxiety, but it never fully prepares you for a first impression.
 I may be extremely comfortable speaking to someone via text or messenger but may be too nervous in person and those nerves could show.

Personally, I have had a ton of experience as I am now 30 years old. I felt that over time I got less nervous. It's kind of like anything. The more you do something the more confident you get. I remember my first date I actually spoke to a girl online a ton. Meeting her I was so nervous because I really liked her and felt she liked me as well.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

In my opinion, technology has greatly improved dating. I've found that dating apps in particular increase the odds of finding a relationship, at least for me. Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Obviously there is still stress when it comes to dating even with the advancement of technology. Ultimately, no matter how well you know someone via the internet or via messaging apps, that first meeting is person is very nerve wracking. 
I think technology does a really good job in helping alleviate anxiety, but it never fully prepares you for a first impression.
 I may be extremely comfortable speaking to someone via text or messenger but may be too nervous in person and those nerves could show.

Personally, I have had a ton of experience as I am now 30 years old. I felt that over time I got less nervous. It's kind of like anything. The more you do something the more confident you get.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has greatly improved dating. I've found that dating apps in particular increase the odds of finding a relationship, at least for me. Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult.

Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult.

In my opinion, technology has greatly improved dating. I've found that dating apps in particular increase the odds of finding a relationship, at least for me. Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Obviously there is still stress when it comes to dating even with the advancement of technology. Ultimately, no matter how well you know someone via the internet or via messaging apps, that first meeting is person is very nerve wracking. 
I think technology does a really good job in helping alleviate anxiety, but it never fully prepares you for a first impression.
 I may be extremely comfortable speaking to someone via text or messenger but may be too nervous in person and those nerves could show.

Personally, I have had a ton of experience as I am now 30 years old. I felt that over time I got less nervous. It's kind of like anything. The more you do something the more confident you get. I remember my first date I actually spoke to a girl online a ton. Meeting her I was so nervous because I really liked her and felt she liked me as well. We finally met and things went pretty smoothly, much better than I was expecting considering how nervous I was. I look back at that first date and laugh because I was putting so much pressure on myself for no reason.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has greatly improved dating. I've found that dating apps in particular increase the odds of finding a relationship, at least for me. Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Obviously there is still stress when it comes to dating even with the advancement of technology. Ultimately, no matter how well you know someone via the internet or via messaging apps, that first meeting is person is very nerve wracking. 
I think technology does a really good job in helping alleviate anxiety, but it never fully prepares you for a first impression.
 I may be extremely comfortable speaking to someone via text or messenger but may be too nervous in person and those nerves could show.

Personally, I have had a ton of experience as I am now 30 years old. I felt that over time I got less nervous. It's kind of like anything. The more you do something the more confident you get. I remember my first date I actually spoke to a girl online a ton. Meeting her I was so nervous because I really liked her and felt she liked me as well. We finally met and things went pretty smoothly, much better than I was expecting considering how nervous I was. I look back at that first date and laugh because I was putting so much pressure on myself for no reason.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Obviously there is still stress when it comes to dating even with the advancement of technology. Ultimately, no matter how well you know someone via the internet or via messaging apps, that first meeting is person is very nerve wracking.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has greatly improved dating. I've found that dating apps in particular increase the odds of finding a relationship, at least for me. Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Obviously there is still stress when it comes to dating even with the advancement of technology. Ultimately, no matter how well you know someone via the internet or via messaging apps, that first meeting is person is very nerve wracking. 
I think technology does a really good job in helping alleviate anxiety, but it never fully prepares you for a first impression.
 I may be extremely comfortable speaking to someone via text or messenger but may be too nervous in person and those nerves could show.

Personally, I have had a ton of experience as I am now 30 years old. I felt that over time I got less nervous. It's kind of like anything. The more you do something the more confident you get. I remember my first date I actually spoke to a girl online a ton. Meeting her I was so nervous because I really liked her and felt she liked me as well. We finally met and things went pretty smoothly, much better than I was expecting considering how nervous I was. I look back at that first date and laugh because I was putting so much pressure on myself for no reason.

Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Obviously there is still stress when it comes to dating even with the advancement of technology. Ultimately, no matter how well you know someone via the internet or via messaging apps, that first meeting is person is very nerve wracking. 
I think technology does a really good job in helping alleviate anxiety, but it never fully prepares you for a first impression.
 I may be extremely comfortable speaking to someone via text or messenger but may be too nervous in person and those nerves could show.

Personally, I have had a ton of experience as I am now 30 years old. I felt that over time I got less nervous. It's kind of like anything. The more you do something the more confident you get. I remember my first date I actually spoke to a girl online a ton. Meeting her I was so nervous because I really liked her and felt she liked me as well. We finally met and things went pretty smoothly, much better than I was expecting considering how nervous I was. I look back at that first date and laugh because I was putting so much pressure on myself for no reason.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has greatly improved dating. I've found that dating apps in particular increase the odds of finding a relationship, at least for me. Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Obviously there is still stress when it comes to dating even with the advancement of technology. Ultimately, no matter how well you know someone via the internet or via messaging apps, that first meeting is person is very nerve wracking. 
I think technology does a really good job in helping alleviate anxiety, but it never fully prepares you for a first impression.
 I may be extremely comfortable speaking to someone via text or messenger but may be too nervous in person and those nerves could show.

Personally, I have had a ton of experience as I am now 30 years old. I felt that over time I got less nervous. It's kind of like anything. The more you do something the more confident you get. I remember my first date I actually spoke to a girl online a ton. Meeting her I was so nervous because I really liked her and felt she liked me as well. We finally met and things went pretty smoothly, much better than I was expecting considering how nervous I was. I look back at that first date and laugh because I was putting so much pressure on myself for no reason.

Technology lets us break the ice and then ultimately when you're on the date you just have to be yourself. The other person is probably just as nervous as you are. Af",user,28,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has greatly improved dating. I've found that dating apps in particular increase the odds of finding a relationship, at least for me. Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Obviously there is still stress when it comes to dating even with the advancement of technology. Ultimately, no matter how well you know someone via the internet or via messaging apps, that first meeting is person is very nerve wracking. 
I think technology does a really good job in helping alleviate anxiety, but it never fully prepares you for a first impression.
 I may be extremely comfortable speaking to someone via text or messenger but may be too nervous in person and those nerves could show.

Personally, I have had a ton of experience as I am now 30 years old. I felt that over time I got less nervous. It's kind of like anything. The more you do something the more confident you get. I remember my first date I actually spoke to a girl online a ton. Meeting her I was so nervous because I really liked her and felt she liked me as well. We finally met and things went pretty smoothly, much better than I was expecting considering how nervous I was. I look back at that first date and laugh because I was putting so much pressure on myself for no reason.

Technology lets us break the ice and then ultimately when you're on the date you just have to be yourself. The other person is probably just as nervous as you are. After all, nobody wants to embarrass them",user,28,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Obviously there is still stress when it comes to dating even with the advancement of technology. Ultimately, no matter how well you know someone via the internet or via messaging apps, that first meeting is person is very nerve wracking. 
I think technology does a really good job in helping alleviate anxiety, but it never fully prepares you for a first impression.
 I may be extremely comfortable speaking to someone via text or messenger but may be too nervous in person and those nerves could show.

Personally, I have had a ton of experience as I am now 30 years old. I felt that over time I got less nervous. It's kind of like anything. The more you do something the more confident you get. I remember my first date I actually spoke to a girl online a ton. Meeting her I was so nervous because I really liked her and felt she liked me as well. We finally met and things went pretty smoothly, much better than I was expecting considering how nervous I was. I look back at that first date and laugh because I was putting so much pressure on myself for no reason.

Technology lets us break the ice and then ultimately when you're on the date you just have to be yourself. The other person is probably just as nervous as you are. After all, nobody wants to embarrass themselves or come across negatively on a first date. Of course there are first dates that just don't go well. That's a pa",user,30,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I remember my first date I actually spoke to a girl online a ton. Meeting her I was so nervous because I really liked her and felt she liked me as well. We finally met and things went pretty smoothly, much better than I was expecting considering how nervous I was. I look back at that first date and laugh because I was putting so much pressure on myself for no reason.

Technology lets us break the ice and then ultimately when you're on the date you just have to be yourself. The other person is probably just as nervous as you are. After all, nobody wants to embarrass themselves or come across negatively on a first date. Of course there are first dates that just don't go well. That's a part of life.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has greatly improved dating. I've found that dating apps in particular increase the odds of finding a relationship, at least for me. Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Obviously there is still stress when it comes to dating even with the advancement of technology. Ultimately, no matter how well you know someone via the internet or via messaging apps, that first meeting is person is very nerve wracking. 
I think technology does a really good job in helping alleviate anxiety, but it never fully prepares you for a first impression.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Obviously there is still stress when it comes to dating even with the advancement of technology. Ultimately, no matter how well you know someone via the internet or via messaging apps, that first meeting is person is very nerve wracking. 
I think technology does a really good job in helping alleviate anxiety, but it never fully prepares you for a first impression.
 I may be extremely comfortable speaking to someone via text or messenger but may be too nervous in person and those nerves could show.

Personally, I have had a ton of experience as I am now 30 years old. I felt that over time I got less nervous. It's kind of like anything. The more you do something the more confident you get. I remember my first date I actually spoke to a girl online a ton. Meeting her I was so nervous because I really liked her and felt she liked me as well. We finally met and things went pretty smoothly, much better than I was expecting considering how nervous I was. I look back at that first date and laugh because I was putting so much pressure on myself for no reason.

Technology lets us break the ice and then ultimately when you're on the date you just have to be yourself. The other person is probably just as nervous as you are. After all, nobody wants to embarrass themselves or come across negatively on a first date. Of course there are first dates that just don't go well. That's a part of life. 

But overall, technology has definitely helped me in my dating experiences. My current girlfriend I met on Tinder",user,32,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has greatly improved dating. I've found that dating apps in particular increase the odds of finding a relationship, at least for me. Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Obviously there is still stress when it comes to dating even with the advancement of technology. Ultimately, no matter how well you know someone via the internet or via messaging apps, that first meeting is person is very nerve wracking. 
I think technology does a really good job in helping alleviate anxiety, but it never fully prepares you for a first impression.
 I may be extremely comfortable speaking to someone via text or messenger but may be too nervous in person and those nerves could show.

Personally, I have had a ton of experience as I am now 30 years old. I felt that over time I got less nervous. It's kind of like anything. The more you do something the more confident you get. I remember my first date I actually spoke to a girl online a ton. Meeting her I was so nervous because I really liked her and felt she liked me as well. We finally met and things went pretty smoothly, much better than I was expecting considering how nervous I was. I look back at that first date and laugh because I was putting so much pressure on myself for no reason.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has greatly improved dating. I've found that dating apps in particular increase the odds of finding a relationship, at least for me. Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Obviously there is still stress when it comes to dating even with the advancement of technology. Ultimately, no matter how well you know someone via the internet or via messaging apps, that first meeting is person is very nerve wracking. 
I think technology does a really good job in helping alleviate anxiety, but it never fully prepares you for a first impression.
 I may be extremely comfortable speaking to someone via text or messenger but may be too nervous in person and those nerves could show.

Personally, I have had a ton of experience as I am now 30 years old. I felt that over time I got less nervous. It's kind of like anything. The more you do something the more confident you get. I remember my first date I actually spoke to a girl online a ton. Meeting her I was so nervous because I really liked her and felt she liked me as well. We finally met and things went pretty smoothly, much better than I was expecting considering how nervous I was.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has greatly improved dating. I've found that dating apps in particular increase the odds of finding a relationship, at least for me. Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Obviously there is still stress when it comes to dating even with the advancement of technology. Ultimately, no matter how well you know someone via the internet or via messaging apps, that first meeting is person is very nerve wracking. 
I think technology does a really good job in helping alleviate anxiety, but it never fully prepares you for a first impression.
 I may be extremely comfortable speaking to someone via text or messenger but may be too nervous in person and those nerves could show.

Personally, I have had a ton of experience as I am now 30 years old. I felt that over time I got less nervous. It's kind of like anything. The more you do something the more confident you get. I remember my first date I actually spoke to a girl online a ton. Meeting her I was so nervous because I really liked her and felt she liked me as well. We finally met and things went pretty smoothly, much better than I was expecting considering how nervous I was. I look back at that first date and laugh because I was putting so much pressure on myself for no reason.

Technology lets us break the ice and then ultimately when you're on the date you just have to be yourself. The other person is probably just as nervous as you are. After all, nobody wants to embarrass themselves or come across negatively on a first date. Of course there are first dates that just don't go well. That's a part of life. 

But overall, technology has definitely helped me in my dating experiences. My current girlfriend I met on Tinder. I swiped right, she responded back to me and we were off to the races. A",user,34,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Obviously there is still stress when it comes to dating even with the advancement of technology. Ultimately, no matter how well you know someone via the internet or via messaging apps, that first meeting is person is very nerve wracking. 
I think technology does a really good job in helping alleviate anxiety, but it never fully prepares you for a first impression.
 I may be extremely comfortable speaking to someone via text or messenger but may be too nervous in person and those nerves could show.

Personally, I have had a ton of experience as I am now 30 years old. I felt that over time I got less nervous. It's kind of like anything. The more you do something the more confident you get. I remember my first date I actually spoke to a girl online a ton. Meeting her I was so nervous because I really liked her and felt she liked me as well. We finally met and things went pretty smoothly, much better than I was expecting considering how nervous I was. I look back at that first date and laugh because I was putting so much pressure on myself for no reason.

Technology lets us break the ice and then ultimately when you're on the date you just have to be yourself. The other person is probably just as nervous as you are. After all, nobody wants to embarrass themselves or come across negatively on a first date. Of course there are first dates that just don't go well. That's a part of life. 

But overall, technology has definitely helped me in my dating experiences. My current girlfriend I met on Tinder. I swiped right, she responded back to me and we were off to the races. And the funny thing is, if you think about it...we never would have ev",user,34,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has greatly improved dating. I've found that dating apps in particular increase the odds of finding a relationship, at least for me. Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Obviously there is still stress when it comes to dating even with the advancement of technology. Ultimately, no matter how well you know someone via the internet or via messaging apps, that first meeting is person is very nerve wracking. 
I think technology does a really good job in helping alleviate anxiety, but it never fully prepares you for a first impression.
 I may be extremely comfortable speaking to someone via text or messenger but may be too nervous in person and those nerves could show.

Personally, I have had a ton of experience as I am now 30 years old. I felt that over time I got less nervous. It's kind of like anything. The more you do something the more confident you get. I remember my first date I actually spoke to a girl online a ton. Meeting her I was so nervous because I really liked her and felt she liked me as well. We finally met and things went pretty smoothly, much better than I was expecting considering how nervous I was. I look back at that first date and laugh because I was putting so much pressure on myself for no reason.

Technology lets us break the ice and then ultimately when you're on the date you just have to be yourself. The other person is probably just as nervous as you are. After all, nobody wants to embarrass themselves or come across negatively on a first date. Of course there are first dates that just don't go well. That's a part of life. 

But overall, technology has definitely helped me in my dating experiences. My current girlfriend I met on Tinder. I swiped right, she responded back to me and we were off to the races.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Obviously there is still stress when it comes to dating even with the advancement of technology. Ultimately, no matter how well you know someone via the internet or via messaging apps, that first meeting is person is very nerve wracking. 
I think technology does a really good job in helping alleviate anxiety, but it never fully prepares you for a first impression.
 I may be extremely comfortable speaking to someone via text or messenger but may be too nervous in person and those nerves could show.

Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Obviously there is still stress when it comes to dating even with the advancement of technology. Ultimately, no matter how well you know someone via the internet or via messaging apps, that first meeting is person is very nerve wracking. 
I think technology does a really good job in helping alleviate anxiety, but it never fully prepares you for a first impression.
 I may be extremely comfortable speaking to someone via text or messenger but may be too nervous in person and those nerves could show.

Personally, I have had a ton of experience as I am now 30 years old. I felt that over time I got less nervous. It's kind of like anything. The more you do something the more confident you get. I remember my first date I actually spoke to a girl online a ton. Meeting her I was so nervous because I really liked her and felt she liked me as well. We finally met and things went pretty smoothly, much better than I was expecting considering how nervous I was. I look back at that first date and laugh because I was putting so much pressure on myself for no reason.

Technology lets us break the ice and then ultimately when you're on the date you just have to be yourself. The other person is probably just as nervous as you are. After all, nobody wants to embarrass themselves or come across negatively on a first date. Of course there are first dates that just don't go well. That's a part of life. 

But overall, technology has definitely helped me in my dating experiences. My current girlfriend I met on Tinder. I swiped right, she responded back to me and we were off to the races. And the funny thing is, if you think about it...we never would have even met if it weren't for technology. So I say thank",user,35,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Technology lets us break the ice and then ultimately when you're on the date you just have to be yourself. The other person is probably just as nervous as you are. After all, nobody wants to embarrass themselves or come across negatively on a first date. Of course there are first dates that just don't go well. That's a part of life. 

But overall, technology has definitely helped me in my dating experiences. My current girlfriend I met on Tinder. I swiped right, she responded back to me and we were off to the races. And the funny thing is, if you think about it...we never would have even met if it weren't for technology. So I say thank you techn",user,35,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology has greatly improved dating. I've found that dating apps in particular increase the odds of finding a relationship, at least for me. Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Obviously there is still stress when it comes to dating even with the advancement of technology. Ultimately, no matter how well you know someone via the internet or via messaging apps, that first meeting is person is very nerve wracking. 
I think technology does a really good job in helping alleviate anxiety, but it never fully prepares you for a first impression.
 I may be extremely comfortable speaking to someone via text or messenger but may be too nervous in person and those nerves could show.

Personally, I have had a ton of experience as I am now 30 years old. I felt that over time I got less nervous. It's kind of like anything. The more you do something the more confident you get. I remember my first date I actually spoke to a girl online a ton. Meeting her I was so nervous because I really liked her and felt she liked me as well. We finally met and things went pretty smoothly, much better than I was expecting considering how nervous I was.
