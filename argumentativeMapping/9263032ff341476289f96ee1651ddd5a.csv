In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.

They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.
Football, basketball players are paid when they are in the professional league.
 They'll possibly be making millions of dollars per year. They don't need to be paid any sooner than that. It's basically like saying we should start paying people who are in medical school in advance before they become doctors. They save lives.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.

 They'll possibly be making millions of dollars per year. They don't need to be paid any sooner than that. It's basically like saying we should start paying people who are in medical school in advance before they become doctors. They save lives.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.

It's basically like saying we should start paying people who are in medical school in advance before they become doctors. They save lives. If they aren't getting paid then why should people who just play a game?

No one should take the focus away from education. Still, many people believe that paying athletes would be a good idea.

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.
Football, basketball players are paid when they are in the professional league.
 They'll possibly be making millions of dollars per year. They don't need to be paid any sooner than that. It's basically like saying we should start paying people who are in medical school in advance before they become doctors. They save lives. If they aren't getting paid then why should people who just play a game?

No one should take the focus away from education. Still, many people believe that paying athletes would be a good idea. They claim that it would bring more money into colleges while making the players more satisfied. That's probably true, but at what cost? The integrity of colleges is too important.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.

It's basically like saying we should start paying people who are in medical school in advance before they become doctors. They save lives.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.
Football, basketball players are paid when they are in the professional league.
 They'll possibly be making millions of dollars per year. They don't need to be paid any sooner than that. It's basically like saying we should start paying people who are in medical school in advance before they become doctors. They save lives. If they aren't getting paid then why should people who just play a game?

No one should take the focus away from education. Still, many people believe that paying athletes would be a good idea. They claim that it would bring more money into colleges while making the players more satisfied. That's probably true, but at what cost? The integrity of colleges is too important. Colleges depend on athletics to bring in a lot of money. That's a problem they need to resolve without forcing themselves to rely on athletics even more t",user,29,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.
Football, basketball players are paid when they are in the professional league.
 They'll possibly be making millions of dollars per year. They don't need to be paid any sooner than that. It's basically like saying we should start paying people who are in medical school in advance before they become doctors. They save lives. If they aren't getting paid then why should people who just play a game?

No one should take the focus away from education. Still, many people believe that paying athletes would be a good idea. They claim that it would bring more money into colleges while making the players more satisfied. That's probably true, but at what cost? The integrity of colleges is too important. Colleges depend on athletics to bring in a lot of money. That's a problem they need to resolve without forcing themselves to rely on athletics even more than before.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is.

It's basically like saying we should start paying people who are in medical school in advance before they become doctors. They save lives. If they aren't getting paid then why should people who just play a game?

No one should take the focus away from education. Still, many people believe that paying athletes would be a good idea. They claim that it would bring more money into colleges while making the players more satisfied. That's probably true, but at what cost? The integrity of colleges is too important. Colleges depend on athletics to bring in a lot of money. That's a problem they need to resolve without forcing themselves to rely on athletics even more than before. Digging a deeper hole isn't going to get you out of it. It will only make it worse.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.
Football, basketball players are paid when they are in the professional league.
 They'll possibly be making millions of dollars per year. They don't need to be paid any sooner than that. It's basically like saying we should start paying people who are in medical school in advance before they become doctors. They save lives. If they aren't getting paid then why should people who just play a game?

No one should take the focus away from education. Still, many people believe that paying athletes would be a good idea. They claim that it would bring more money into colleges while making the players more satisfied. That's probably true, but at what cost? The integrity of colleges is too important. Colleges depend on athletics to bring in a lot of money. That's a problem they need to resolve without forcing themselves to rely on athletics even more than before. Digging a deeper hole isn't going to get you out of it. It will only make it worse.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.
Football, basketball players are paid when they are in the professional league.
 They'll possibly be making millions of dollars per year. They don't need to be paid any sooner than that. It's basically like saying we should start paying people who are in medical school in advance before they become doctors. They save lives. If they aren't getting paid then why should people who just play a game?

No one should take the focus away from education. Still, many people believe that paying athletes would be a good idea. They claim that it would bring more money into colleges while making the players more satisfied. That's probably true, but at what cost? The integrity of colleges is too important. Colleges depend on athletics to bring in a lot of money. That's a problem they need to resolve without forcing themselves to rely on athletics even more than before.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.

It's basically like saying we should start paying people who are in medical school in advance before they become doctors. They save lives. If they aren't getting paid then why should people who just play a game?

No one should take the focus away from education. Still, many people believe that paying athletes would be a good idea. They claim that it would bring more money into colleges while making the players more satisfied. That's probably true, but at what cost? The integrity of colleges is too important.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.
Football, basketball players are paid when they are in the professional league.
 They'll possibly be making millions of dollars per year. They don't need to be paid any sooner than that. It's basically like saying we should start paying people who are in medical school in advance before they become doctors. They save lives. If they aren't getting paid then why should people who just play a game?

No one should take the focus away from education. Still, many people believe that paying athletes would be a good idea. They claim that it would bring more money into colleges while making the players more satisfied. That's probably true, but at what cost? The integrity of colleges is too important.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.
Football, basketball players are paid when they are in the professional league.
 They'll possibly be making millions of dollars per year. They don't need to be paid any sooner than that. It's basically like saying we should start paying people who are in medical school in advance before they become doctors. They save lives. If they aren't getting paid then why should people who just play a game?

No one should take the focus away from education. Still, many people believe that paying athletes would be a good idea. They claim that it would bring more money into colleges while making the players more satisfied. That's probably true, but at what cost? The integrity of colleges is too important. Colleges depend on athletics to bring in a lot of money. That's a problem they need to resolve without forcing themselves to rely on athletics even more than before. Digging a deeper hole isn't going to get you out of it. It will only make it worse.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.

 They'll possibly be making millions of dollars per year. They don't need to be paid any sooner than that. It's basically like saying we should start paying people who are in medical school in advance before they become doctors. They save lives. If they aren't getting paid then why should people who just play a game?

No one should take the focus away from education. Still, many people believe that paying athletes would be a good idea. They claim that it would bring more money into colleges while making the players more satisfied. That's probably true, but at what cost? The integrity of colleges is too important.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers.

There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers.

There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.

They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is.

No one should take the focus away from education. Still, many people believe that paying athletes would be a good idea. They claim that it would bring more money into colleges while making the players more satisfied. That's probably true, but at what cost? The integrity of colleges is too important.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.

It's basically like saying we should start paying people who are in medical school in advance before they become doctors. They save lives. If they aren't getting paid then why should people who just play a game?

No one should take the focus away from education. Still, many people believe that paying athletes would be a good idea. They claim that it would bring more money into colleges while making the players more satisfied. That's probably true, but at what cost? The integrity of colleges is too important.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.
Football, basketball players are paid when they are in the professional league.
 They'll possibly be making millions of dollars per year. They don't need to be paid any sooner than that. It's basically like saying we should start paying people who are in medical school in advance before they become doctors. They save lives. If they aren't getting paid then why should people who just play a game?

No one should take the focus away from education. Still, many people believe that paying athletes would be a good idea. They claim that it would bring more money into colleges while making the players more satisfied. That's probably true, but at what cost? The integrity of colleges is too important. Colleges depend on athletics to bring in a lot of money. That's a problem they need to resolve without forcing themselves to rely on athletics even more than before.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.
Football, basketball players are paid when they are in the professional league.
 They'll possibly be making millions of dollars per year. They don't need to be paid any sooner than that. It's basically like saying we should start paying people who are in medical school in advance before they become doctors. They save lives. If they aren't getting paid then why should people who just play a game?

No one should take the focus away from education. Still, many people believe that paying athletes would be a good idea.

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.
Football, basketball players are paid when they are in the professional league.
 They'll possibly be making millions of dollars per year. They don't need to be paid any sooner than that. It's basically like saying we should start paying people who are in medical school in advance before they become doctors. They save lives. If they aren't getting paid then why should people who just play a game?

No one should take the focus away from education. Still, many people believe that paying athletes would be a good idea. They claim that it would bring more money into colleges while making the players more satisfied. That's probably true, but at what cost? The integrity of colleges is too important. Colleges depend on athletics to bring in a lot of money. That's a problem they need to resolve without forcing themselves to rely on athletics even more than before. Digging a deeper hole isn't going to get you out of it. It will only make it worse.

It's a bad idea to pay athletes. It hurts everyone except the athletes themselves and they already get enough special treatment. They have a lot of privileges.
