In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. 

I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well.

There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road.

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road.

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. 

I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with.

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road.

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. 

I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with.

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. 

I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with.

I find the audiobook version helps me retain information better as well. I struggle a bit when reading to fully take in what I'm reading. I read very fast and a lot o

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. 

I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with.

I find the audiobook version helps me retain information better as well. I struggle a bit when reading to fully take in what I'm reading. I read very fast and a lot of times I'll finish

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. 

I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with.

I find the audiobook version helps me retain information better as well. I struggle a bit when reading to fully take in what I'm reading. I read very fast and a lot of times I'll finish a chapter withou

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. 

I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with.

I find the audiobook version helps me retain information better as well. I struggle a bit when reading to fully take in what I'm reading. I read very fast and a lot of times I'll finish a chapter without really understanding what I just re

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. 

I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with.

I find the audiobook version helps me retain information better as well. I struggle a bit when reading to fully take in what I'm reading. I read very fast and a lot of times I'll finish a chapter without really understanding what I just read. I for whatever reason learn better when I hear the information out loud. I think listening

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. 

I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with.

I find the audiobook version helps me retain information better as well. I struggle a bit when reading to fully take in what I'm reading. I read very fast and a lot of times I'll finish a chapter without really understanding what I just read. I for whatever reason learn better when I hear the information out loud. I think

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. 

I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with.

I find the audiobook version helps me retain information better as well. I struggle a bit when reading to fully take in what I'm reading. I read very fast and a lot of times I'll finish a chapter without really understanding what I just read. I for whatever reason learn better when I hear the information out loud.

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. 

I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. 

I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. 

I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with.

I find the audiobook version helps me retain information better as well. I struggle a bit when reading to fully take in what I'm reading. I read very fast and a lot of times I'll finish a chapter without really understanding what I just read. I for whatever reason learn better when I hear the information out loud. I typically listen to audiobooks late at night. I don't have any distractions at that point so I can concentrate best.

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road.

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. 

I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with.

I find the audiobook version helps me retain information better as well. I struggle a bit when reading to fully take in what I'm reading. I read very fast and a lot of times I'll finish a chapter without really understanding what I just read. I for whatever reason learn better when I hear the information out loud. I typically listen to audiobooks late at night. I don't have any distractions at that point so I can concentrate best.

There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. 

I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with.

I find the audiobook version helps me retain information better as well. I struggle a bit when reading to fully take in what I'm reading. I read very fast and a lot of times I'll finish a chapter without really understanding what I just read. I for whatever reason learn better when I hear the information out loud. I typically listen to audiobooks late at night. I don't have any distractions at that point so I can concentrate best.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. 

I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with.

I find the audiobook version helps me retain information better as well. I struggle a bit when reading to fully take in what I'm reading. I read very fast and a lot of times I'll finish a chapter without really understanding what I just read. I for whatever reason learn better when I hear the information out loud. I typically listen to audiobooks late at night. I don't have any distractions at that point so I can concentrate best.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. 

I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with.

I find the audiobook version helps me retain information better as well. I struggle a bit when reading to fully take in what I'm reading. I read very fast and a lot of times I'll finish a chapter without really understanding what I just read. I for whatever reason learn better when I hear the information out loud. I typically listen to audiobooks late at night. I don't have any distractions at that point so I can concentrate best.

I personally prefer my books to be audiobooks. I find the benefits really help me understand the book better than if I were to read it the traditional way. So a

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. 

I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. 

I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with.

I find the audiobook version helps me retain information better as well. I struggle a bit when reading to fully take in what I'm reading. I read very fast and a lot of times I'll finish a chapter without really understanding what I just read. I for whatever reason learn better when I hear the information out loud. I typically listen to audiobooks late at night. I don't have any distractions at that point so I can concentrate best.

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. 

I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with.

I find the audiobook version helps me retain information better as well. I struggle a bit when reading to fully take in what I'm reading. I read very fast and a lot of times I'll finish a chapter without really understanding what I just read. I for whatever reason learn better when I hear the information out loud. I typically listen to audiobooks late at night. I don't have any distractions at that point so I can concentrate best.

I personally prefer my books to be audiobooks. I find the benefits really help me understand the book better than if I were to read it the traditional way. So audiobooks have really helped me in my life. Without them, I would

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. 

I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with.

I find the audiobook version helps me retain information better as well. I struggle a bit when reading to fully take in what I'm reading. I read very fast and a lot of times I'll finish a chapter without really understanding what I just read. I for whatever reason learn better when I hear the information out loud. I typically listen to audiobooks late at night. I don't have any distractions at that point so I can concentrate best.
