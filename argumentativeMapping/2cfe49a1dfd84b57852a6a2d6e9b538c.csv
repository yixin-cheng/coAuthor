In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requir",user,15,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff.

In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of a",user,16,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school?

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic.

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff.

In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time.

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school?

In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time. Is it really fair, or reasonable, to subject students to a decade and a half of compulsory education, when the end result is that they have to spend another decade and a half learning things that they should have learned in the first place?

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time.

Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade?

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time. Is it really fair, or reasonable, to subject students to a decade and a half of compulsory education, when the end result is that they have to spend another decade and a half learning things that they should have learned in the first place?

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff.

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time. Is it really fair, or reasonable, to subject students to a decade and a half of compulsory education, when the end result is that they have to spend another decade and a half learning things that they should have learned in the first place?

In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time. Is it really fair, or reasonable, to subject students to a decade and a half of compulsory education, when the end result is that they have to spend another decade and a half learning things that they should have learned in the first place? Is it fair for it to be done at the taxpayer's expense?

In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time. Is it really fair, or reasonable, to subject students to a decade and a half of compulsory education, when the end result is that they have to spend another decade and a half learning things that they should have learned in the first place? Is it fair for it to be done at the taxpayer's expense?

I say that it's not. Stude

In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time. Is it really fair, or reasonable, to subject students to a decade and a half of compulsory education, when the end result is that they have to spend another decade and a half learning things that they should have learned in the first place? Is it fair for it to be done at the taxpayer's expense?

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time. Is it really fair, or reasonable, to subject students to a decade and a half of compulsory education, when the end result is that they have to spend another decade and a half learning things that they should have learned in the first place? Is it fair for it to be done at the taxpayer's expense?

I say that it's not. Students are given over to the school fo

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time. Is it really fair, or reasonable, to subject students to a decade and a half of compulsory education, when the end result is that they have to spend another decade and a half learning things that they should have learned in the first place? Is it fair for it to be done at the taxpayer's expense?

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time. Is it really fair, or reasonable, to subject students to a decade and a half of compulsory education, when the end result is that they have to spend another decade and a half learning things that they should have learned in the first place? Is it fair for it to be done at the taxpayer's expense?

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade?

I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time. Is it really fair, or reasonable, to subject students to a decade and a half of compulsory education, when the end result is that they have to spend another decade and a half learning things that they should have learned in the first place? Is it fair for it to be done at the taxpayer's expense?

I say that it's not. Students are given over to the school for all that time by parents, and the school is supported in its endeavors by the taxpayer, with",user,20,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff.

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time.

In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time. Is it really fair, or reasonable, to subject students to a decade and a half of compulsory education, when the end result is that they have to spend another decade and a half learning things that they should have learned in the first place? Is it fair for it to be done at the taxpayer's expense?

I say that it's not. Students are given over to the school for all that time by parents, and the school is supported in its endeavors by the taxpayer, with an expectation of producing useful result,",user,20,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time. Is it really fair, or reasonable, to subject students to a decade and a half of compulsory education, when the end result is that they have to spend another decade and a half learning things that they should have learned in the first place?

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time. Is it really fair, or reasonable, to subject students to a decade and a half of compulsory education, when the end result is that they have to spend another decade and a half learning things that they should have learned in the first place?

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time.

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time. Is it really fair, or reasonable, to subject students to a decade and a half of compulsory education, when the end result is that they have to spend another decade and a half learning things that they should have learned in the first place? Is it fair for it to be done at the taxpayer's expense?

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade?

So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time. Is it really fair, or reasonable, to subject students to a decade and a half of compulsory education, when the end result is that they have to spend another decade and a half learning things that they should have learned in the first place? Is it fair for it to be done at the taxpayer's expense?

I say that it's not.

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time. Is it really fair, or reasonable, to subject students to a decade and a half of compulsory education, when the end result is that they have to spend another decade and a half learning things that they should have learned in the first place? Is it fair for it to be done at the taxpayer's expense?

I say that it's not. Students are given over to the school for all that time by parents, and the school is supported in its endeavors by the taxpayer, with an expectation of producing useful results, as measured by employability.

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time. Is it really fair, or reasonable, to subject students to a decade and a half of compulsory education, when the end result is that they have to spend another decade and a half learning things that they should have learned in the first place? Is it fair for it to be done at the taxpayer's expense?

I say that it's not.

So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time. Is it really fair, or reasonable, to subject students to a decade and a half of compulsory education, when the end result is that they have to spend another decade and a half learning things that they should have learned in the first place? Is it fair for it to be done at the taxpayer's expense?

I say that it's not. Students are given over to the school for all that time by parents, and the school is supported in its endeavors by the taxpayer, with an expectation of producing useful results, as measured by employability. For all that time and money to be spent for nothing, isn't just an example of misplaced priorities in education",user,21,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic.
