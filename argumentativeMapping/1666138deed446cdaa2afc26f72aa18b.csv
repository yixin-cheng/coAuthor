Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there is nothing selfish about pursuing exciting and extreme sports, especially mountain climbing.   It is in keeping with the human spirit to seek what is exciting and what we hope will give us a sense of belonging and worth. And one way many seek this is by experiencing nature in its most wild setting, near the tops of the world's highest, most imposing mountains. It is a type of presence and joy that these activities bring that is not selfish in nature at all. In fact it makes you more connected to nature and everyone in it. 
As far as I am concerned, a true sport is any participation in which people are trying to push themselves ato see what the human body and mind are capable of. Mountain climbing and similar sports do just that. It is not an easy activity but produces a sense of self-worth when you do finally achieve the goal. And isn't growth what being alive is all about?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there is nothing selfish about pursuing exciting and extreme sports, especially mountain climbing.   It is in keeping with the human spirit to seek what is exciting and what we hope will give us a sense of belonging and worth. And one way many seek this is by experiencing nature in its most wild setting, near the tops of the world's highest, most imposing mountains. It is a type of presence and joy that these activities bring that is not selfish in nature at all. In fact it makes you more connected to nature and everyone in it. 
As far as I am concerned, a true sport is any participation in which people are trying to push themselves ato see what the human body and mind are capable of. Mountain climbing and similar sports do just that. It is not an easy activity but produces a sense of self-worth when you do finally achieve the goal. And isn't growth what being alive is all about? It can't be selfish to achieve ones goals in any case. We all have different goals.

In my opinion, there is nothing selfish about pursuing exciting and extreme sports, especially mountain climbing.   It is in keeping with the human spirit to seek what is exciting and what we hope will give us a sense of belonging and worth.

In my opinion, there is nothing selfish about pursuing exciting and extreme sports, especially mountain climbing.   It is in keeping with the human spirit to seek what is exciting and what we hope will give us a sense of belonging and worth. And one way many seek this is by experiencing nature in its most wild setting, near the tops of the world's highest, most imposing mountains. It is a type of presence and joy that these activities bring that is not selfish in nature at all. In fact it makes you more connected to nature and everyone in it.

It can't be selfish to achieve ones goals in any case. We all have different goals. It is in the difference of our goals and the striving that takes place to achieve them that keeps life interesting, balanced and exciting.
