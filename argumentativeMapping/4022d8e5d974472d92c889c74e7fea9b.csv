Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be sold in vending machines in the bathrooms.  think pads and tampons should be sold in vending machines in the bathrooms because it is a necessity. but not as much as a band aid so the school system should be compensated for providing them. It will also help girls to learn responsibility. It will be up to them to carry $5 at all times just in case they need to use the girls vending machines or to bring their own from home which is encouraged. I look at it this way, girls have survived periods for all of existence but a cut can get infected and kill a person so it is much more important that we provide them instead. We need to make sure that bandages and antibacterial cream is top priority, not pads and tampons. If a girl does have an emergency of sorts she can go to the clinic and they will provide her with gauze to use in the meantime. Gauze is much cheaper and just as effective.

I look at it this way, girls have survived periods for all of existence but a cut can get infected and kill a person so it is much more important that we provide them instead.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be sold in vending machines in the bathrooms.  think pads and tampons should be sold in vending machines in the bathrooms because it is a necessity. but not as much as a band aid so the school system should be compensated for providing them. It will also help girls to learn responsibility. It will be up to them to carry $5 at all times just in case they need to use the girls vending machines or to bring their own from home which is encouraged. I look at it this way, girls have survived periods for all of existence but a cut can get infected and kill a person so it is much more important that we provide them instead. We need to make sure that bandages and antibacterial cream is top priority, not pads and tampons. If a girl does have an emergency of sorts she can go to the clinic and they will provide her with gauze to use in the meantime. Gauze is much cheaper and just as effective. 
I also think we should take time educate the students on periods and how they work that way there is no issues if a girl has an accident. Everyone will understand and just get on with their school work.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be sold in vending machines in the bathrooms.  think pads and tampons should be sold in vending machines in the bathrooms because it is a necessity. but not as much as a band aid so the school system should be compensated for providing them. It will also help girls to learn responsibility. It will be up to them to carry $5 at all times just in case they need to use the girls vending machines or to bring their own from home which is encouraged. I look at it this way, girls have survived periods for all of existence but a cut can get infected and kill a person so it is much more important that we provide them instead. We need to make sure that bandages and antibacterial cream is top priority, not pads and tampons. If a girl does have an emergency of sorts she can go to the clinic and they will provide her with gauze to use in the meantime. Gauze is much cheaper and just as effective.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be sold in vending machines in the bathrooms.  think pads and tampons should be sold in vending machines in the bathrooms because it is a necessity. but not as much as a band aid so the school system should be compensated for providing them. It will also help girls to learn responsibility. It will be up to them to carry $5 at all times just in case they need to use the girls vending machines or to bring their own from home which is encouraged. I look at it this way, girls have survived periods for all of existence but a cut can get infected and kill a person so it is much more important that we provide them instead. We need to make sure that bandages and antibacterial cream is top priority, not pads and tampons. If a girl does have an emergency of sorts she can go to the clinic and they will provide her with gauze to use in the meantime. Gauze is much cheaper and just as effective. 
I also think we should take time educate the students on periods and how they work that way there is no issues if a girl has an accident. Everyone will understand and just get on with their school work.

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be sold in vending machines in the bathrooms.  think pads and tampons should be sold in vending machines in the bathrooms because it is a necessity. but not as much as a band aid so the school system should be compensated for providing them. It will also help girls to learn responsibility. It will be up to them to carry $5 at all times just in case they need to use the girls vending machines or to bring their own from home which is encouraged. I look at it this way, girls have survived periods for all of existence but a cut can get infected and kill a person so it is much more important that we provide them instead. We need to make sure that bandages and antibacterial cream is top priority, not pads and tampons. If a girl does have an emergency of sorts she can go to the clinic and they will provide her with gauze to use in the meantime. Gauze is much cheaper and just as effective.

I look at it this way, girls have survived periods for all of existence but a cut can get infected and kill a person so it is much more important that we provide them instead. We need to make sure that bandages and antibacterial cream is top priority, not pads and tampons. If a girl does have an emergency of sorts she can go to the clinic and they will provide her with gauze to use in the meantime. Gauze is much cheaper and just as effective. 
I also think we should take time educate the students on periods and how they work that way there is no issues if a girl has an accident. Everyone will understand and just get on with their school work. 
This is the kind of system I see being most effective. First, you teach girls responsibility, then you teach the whole school about menstrual cycles so there is not misunderstanding if a girl has a problem all while the school system makes a decent profit selling pads and tampons. That solves all the issues that may arise",user,20,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
text-insert,"Should Schools Provide Free Pads and Tampons?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be sold in vending machines in the bathrooms.  think pads and tampons should be sold in vending machines in the bathrooms because it is a necessity. but not as much as a band aid so the school system should be compensated for providing them. It will also help girls to learn responsibility. It will be up to them to carry $5 at all times just in case they need to use the girls vending machines or to bring their own from home which is encouraged.
