I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves.

I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating.

I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared.

I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. ",user,35,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need to",user,37,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared.

I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating.

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared.

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons.

I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00.

No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons.

And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons. And moreover, not every girl needs pads and tampons all the time because periods only come once a month. So re",user,39,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons. And moreover, not every girl needs pads and tampons all the time because periods only come once a month. So really, it's not that big of a deal. I mean, girls can just use toilet paper if they don't have any pads or tampons. And if they're really desperate, they can just use a sock or something.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life.

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons. And moreover, not every girl needs pads and tampons all the time because periods only come once a month. So really, it's not that big of a deal. I mean, girls can just use toilet paper if they don't have any pads or tampons. And if they're really desperate, they can just use a sock or something. I have heard of socks I mean, it's not like they're going to bleed to death or anything. ",user,42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared.

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons. And moreover, not every girl needs pads and tampons all the time because periods only come once a month. So really, it's not that big of a deal. I mean, girls can just use toilet paper if they don't have any pads or tampons. And if they're really desperate, they can just use a sock or something. I have heard of socks being absorbent. I mean, it's not like they're going to bleed to death or anything.

No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons. And moreover, not every girl needs pads and tampons all the time because periods only come once a month. So really, it's not that big of a deal. I mean, girls can just use toilet paper if they don't have any pads or tampons. And if they're really desperate, they can just use a sock or something. I have heard of socks being absorbent.

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons. And moreover, not every girl needs pads and tampons all the time because periods only come once a month. So really, it's not that big of a deal. I mean, girls can just use toilet paper if they don't have any pads or tampons. And if they're really desperate, they can just use a sock or something. I have heard of socks being absorbent. I mean, it's not like they're going to bleed to death or anything.

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons. And moreover, not every girl needs pads and tampons all the time because periods only come once a month. So really, it's not that big of a deal. I mean, girls can just use toilet paper if they don't have any pads or tampons. And if they're really desperate, they can just use a sock or something. I have heard of socks being absorbent. I mean, it's not like they're going to bleed to death or anything.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons. And moreover, not every girl needs pads and tampons all the time because periods only come once a month. So really, it's not that big of a deal. I mean, girls can just use toilet paper if they don't have any pads or tampons. And if they're really desperate, they can just use a sock or something. I have heard of socks being absorbent. I mean, it's not like they're going to bleed to death or anything. 

When it comes down to it, I don't really want to have to subsidize the cost of pads and tampons for girls. I mean, it's not my responsibility. So I do",user,46,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons. And moreover, not every girl needs pads and tampons all the time because periods only come once a month. So really, it's not that big of a deal. I mean, girls can just use toilet paper if they don't have any pads or tampons. And if they're really desperate, they can just use a sock or something. I have heard of socks being absorbent.

I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life.

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons. And moreover, not every girl needs pads and tampons all the time because periods only come once a month. So really, it's not that big of a deal. I mean, girls can just use toilet paper if they don't have any pads or tampons. And if they're really desperate, they can just use a sock or something. I have heard of socks being absorbent.

I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons. And moreover, not every girl needs pads and tampons all the time because periods only come once a month. So really, it's not that big of a deal. I mean, girls can just use toilet paper if they don't have any pads or tampons. And if they're really desperate, they can just use a sock or something. I have heard of socks being absorbent. I mean, it's not like they're going to bleed to death or anything. 

When it comes down to it, I don't really want to have to subsidize the cost of pads and tampons for girls. I mean, it's not my responsibility. So I don't want my taxes to go toward buying pads and tampons for girls. And I certainly wouldn't want my parents to have to pay extra taxes just so that girls can have free pads and tampons.",api,47,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating.

No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons. And moreover, not every girl needs pads and tampons all the time because periods only come once a month. So really, it's not that big of a deal. I mean, girls can just use toilet paper if they don't have any pads or tampons. And if they're really desperate, they can just use a sock or something. I have heard of socks being absorbent. I mean, it's not like they're going to bleed to death or anything. 

When it comes down to it, I don't really want to have to subsidize the cost of pads and tampons for girls. I mean, it's not my responsibility.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons. And moreover, not every girl needs pads and tampons all the time because periods only come once a month. So really, it's not that big of a deal. I mean, girls can just use toilet paper if they don't have any pads or tampons. And if they're really desperate, they can just use a sock or something. I have heard of socks being absorbent. I mean, it's not like they're going to bleed to death or anything. 

When it comes down to it, I don't really want to have to subsidize the cost of pads and tampons for girls. I mean, it's not my responsibility.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared.

I mean, it's not like they're going to bleed to death or anything. 

When it comes down to it, I don't really want to have to subsidize the cost of pads and tampons for girls. I mean, it's not my responsibility.

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools.

I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons. And moreover, not every girl needs pads and tampons all the time because periods only come once a month. So really, it's not that big of a deal. I mean, girls can just use toilet paper if they don't have any pads or tampons. And if they're really desperate, they can just use a sock or something. I have heard of socks being absorbent. I mean, it's not like they're going to bleed to death or anything. 

When it comes down to it, I don't really want to have to subsidize the cost of pads and tampons for girls. I mean, it's not my responsibility. So I don't want my taxes to go toward buying pads and tampons for girls. And I certainly wouldn't want my parents to have to pay extra taxes just so that girls can have free pads and tampons. That would be some serious BS. If girls need pads and tampons, then they should just get a job and buy them for themselves. We a",user,50,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared.

I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons. And moreover, not every girl needs pads and tampons all the time because periods only come once a month. So really, it's not that big of a deal. I mean, girls can just use toilet paper if they don't have any pads or tampons. And if they're really desperate, they can just use a sock or something. I have heard of socks being absorbent. I mean, it's not like they're going to bleed to death or anything. 

When it comes down to it, I don't really want to have to subsidize the cost of pads and tampons for girls. I mean, it's not my responsibility. So I don't want my taxes to go toward buying pads and tampons for girls. And I certainly wouldn't want my parents to have to pay extra taxes just so that girls can have free pads and tampons. That would be some serious BS. If girls need pads and tampons, then they should just get a job and buy them for themselves. We all need to b",user,50,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life.

I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons. And moreover, not every girl needs pads and tampons all the time because periods only come once a month. So really, it's not that big of a deal. I mean, girls can just use toilet paper if they don't have any pads or tampons. And if they're really desperate, they can just use a sock or something. I have heard of socks being absorbent. I mean, it's not like they're going to bleed to death or anything. 

When it comes down to it, I don't really want to have to subsidize the cost of pads and tampons for girls. I mean, it's not my responsibility. So I don't want my taxes to go toward buying pads and tampons for girls. And I certainly wouldn't want my parents to have to pay extra taxes just so that girls can have free pads and tampons. That would be some serious BS. If girls need pads and tampons, then they should just get a job and buy them for themselves. We all need to budget our money and be responsible.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students?

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons. And moreover, not every girl needs pads and tampons all the time because periods only come once a month. So really, it's not that big of a deal. I mean, girls can just use toilet paper if they don't have any pads or tampons. And if they're really desperate, they can just use a sock or something. I have heard of socks being absorbent.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons. And moreover, not every girl needs pads and tampons all the time because periods only come once a month. So really, it's not that big of a deal. I mean, girls can just use toilet paper if they don't have any pads or tampons. And if they're really desperate, they can just use a sock or something. I have heard of socks being absorbent. I mean, it's not like they're going to bleed to death or anything. 

When it comes down to it, I don't really want to have to subsidize the cost of pads and tampons for girls. I mean, it's not my responsibility. So I don't want my taxes to go toward buying pads and tampons for girls. And I certainly wouldn't want my parents to have to pay extra taxes just so that girls can have free pads and tampons. That would be some serious BS. If girls need pads and tampons, then they should just get a job and buy them for themselves. We all need to budget our money and be responsible. We shouldn't absolve girls fro",user,51,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

And moreover, not every girl needs pads and tampons all the time because periods only come once a month. So really, it's not that big of a deal. I mean, girls can just use toilet paper if they don't have any pads or tampons. And if they're really desperate, they can just use a sock or something. I have heard of socks being absorbent. I mean, it's not like they're going to bleed to death or anything. 

When it comes down to it, I don't really want to have to subsidize the cost of pads and tampons for girls. I mean, it's not my responsibility. So I don't want my taxes to go toward buying pads and tampons for girls. And I certainly wouldn't want my parents to have to pay extra taxes just so that girls can have free pads and tampons.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons. And moreover, not every girl needs pads and tampons all the time because periods only come once a month. So really, it's not that big of a deal. I mean, girls can just use toilet paper if they don't have any pads or tampons. And if they're really desperate, they can just use a sock or something. I have heard of socks being absorbent. I mean, it's not like they're going to bleed to death or anything. 

When it comes down to it, I don't really want to have to subsidize the cost of pads and tampons for girls. I mean, it's not my responsibility. So I don't want my taxes to go toward buying pads and tampons for girls. And I certainly wouldn't want my parents to have to pay extra taxes just so that girls can have free pads and tampons. That would be some serious BS. If girls need pads and tampons, then they should just get a job and buy them for themselves. We all need to budget our money and be responsible.

I mean, girls can just use toilet paper if they don't have any pads or tampons. And if they're really desperate, they can just use a sock or something. I have heard of socks being absorbent. I mean, it's not like they're going to bleed to death or anything. 

When it comes down to it, I don't really want to have to subsidize the cost of pads and tampons for girls. I mean, it's not my responsibility. So I don't want my taxes to go toward buying pads and tampons for girls. And I certainly wouldn't want my parents to have to pay extra taxes just so that girls can have free pads and tampons. That would be some serious BS. If girls need pads and tampons, then they should just get a job and buy them for themselves. We all need to budget our money and be responsible.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools.
