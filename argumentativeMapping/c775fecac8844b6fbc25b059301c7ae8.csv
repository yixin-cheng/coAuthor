In my opinion, listening to audiobooks has its place in the modern world. Although reading has its advantages, listening to an audiobook is great for long commutes, when you have time to exercise, and when you're doing something else but can still be listening to something.

When a person reads they must put their own efforts into the task and this leads to greater immersion into the story. This is what makes someone love a book or wonder at it after the fact. In a sense when you read a book it becomes a collaborative effort between you and the author. This experience is almost magical, especially for younger people.

In my opinion, listening to audiobooks has its place in the modern world. Although reading has its advantages, listening to an audiobook is great for long commutes, when you have time to exercise, and when you're doing something else but can still be listening to something. Of course there is an advantage to actually reading a book that can't be duplicated with the audio book experience. When a person reads they must put their own efforts into the task and this leads to greater immersion into the story. This is what makes someone love a book or wonder at it after the fact. In a sense when you read a book it becomes a collaborative effort between you and the author. This experience is almost magical, especially for younger people.

In my opinion, listening to audiobooks has its place in the modern world. Although reading has its advantages, listening to an audiobook is great for long commutes, when you have time to exercise, and when you're doing something else but can still be listening to something. Of course there is an advantage to actually reading a book that can't be duplicated with the audio book experience. When a person reads they must put their own efforts into the task and this leads to greater immersion into the story. This is what makes someone love a book or wonder at it after the fact. In a sense when you read a book it becomes a collaborative effort between you and the author. This experience is almost magical, especially for younger people. However, I think we must come to accept that audiobooks are here to stay. In fact many people may grow up listening to audiobooks before they ever read a book. As such they promote young people's interest in literature and that can't be a bad thing. It's likely that  the time that people spend with audiobooks would not be spent reading actual books.

In my opinion, listening to audiobooks has its place in the modern world. Although reading has its advantages, listening to an audiobook is great for long commutes, when you have time to exercise, and when you're doing something else but can still be listening to something. Of course there is an advantage to actually reading a book that can't be duplicated with the audio book experience. When a person reads they must put their own efforts into the task and this leads to greater immersion into the story. This is what makes someone love a book or wonder at it after the fact. In a sense when you read a book it becomes a collaborative effort between you and the author. This experience is almost magical, especially for younger people. However, I think we must come to accept that audiobooks are here to stay. In fact many people may grow up listening to audiobooks before they ever read a book. As such they promote young people's interest in literature and that can't be a bad thing. It's likely that  the time that people spend with audiobooks would not be spent reading actual books.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, listening to audiobooks has its place in the modern world. Although reading has its advantages, listening to an audiobook is great for long commutes, when you have time to exercise, and when you're doing something else but can still be listening to something. Of course there is an advantage to actually reading a book that can't be duplicated with the audio book experience. When a person reads they must put their own efforts into the task and this leads to greater immersion into the story. This is what makes someone love a book or wonder at it after the fact. In a sense when you read a book it becomes a collaborative effort between you and the author. This experience is almost magical, especially for younger people. However, I think we must come to accept that audiobooks are here to stay. In fact many people may grow up listening to audiobooks before they ever read a book. As such they promote young people's interest in literature and that can't be a bad thing. It's likely that  the time that people spend with audiobooks would not be spent reading actual books. So in a way audiobooks can give a boost to reading by introducing people to the experience.

So in a way audiobooks can give a boost to reading by introducing people to the experience. As people use audiobooks to listen to books when they can't put their full attention into reading they may also be gaining an interest in books in general. Overall, although audiobooks may lack some of the charm of traditional books they are still a positive activity and should be encouraged. bb",user,20,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, listening to audiobooks has its place in the modern world. Although reading has its advantages, listening to an audiobook is great for long commutes, when you have time to exercise, and when you're doing something else but can still be listening to something. Of course there is an advantage to actually reading a book that can't be duplicated with the audio book experience. When a person reads they must put their own efforts into the task and this leads to greater immersion into the story. This is what makes someone love a book or wonder at it after the fact. In a sense when you read a book it becomes a collaborative effort between you and the author. This experience is almost magical, especially for younger people. However, I think we must come to accept that audiobooks are here to stay. In fact many people may grow up listening to audiobooks before they ever read a book. As such they promote young people's interest in literature and that can't be a bad thing. It's likely that  the time that people spend with audiobooks would not be spent reading actual books.
